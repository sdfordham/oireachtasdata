The level of rent qualifying for relief depends on an individual's marital status and age.<\/p>  <p>  In its 2009 report, the Commission on Taxation was of the view that in the same way as mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing; rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation and, as a result, recommended that rent relief should be discontinued.\u00a0 The relief was abolished in Budget 2011, such that it is no longer available to those that commenced renting for the first time from 08 December 2010.

indicated\u00a0that it would also be appropriate to keep the particular measures as adopted under review from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0While the Central Bank is independent in the setting of such macro prudential measures, this was a point that was\u00a0recognised\u00a0by the\u00a0Bank and it indicated from the outset that it would\u00a0monitor the impact\u00a0of the implemented measures\u00a0ongoing basis, in particular with regard to achieving the stated objectives of the measures and monitoring any unintended consequences.\u00a0 While the macro prudential measures are\u00a0currently in place for only a short period, I am informed by the Central Bank that this monitoring is on-going and\u00a0that it will inform any future consideration and decisions in this area.\u00a0 This will require an ongoing evaluation of relevant data and information, including the particular data on residential mortgage lending that lenders are required to submit to the Central Bank under these macro new prudential regulations.\u00a0\u00a0Also, on a more general level, the Central Bank will\u00a0also maintain a continuing research effort to evaluate macro prudential policy to help ensure its optimum deployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900052#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State

No 147 of 2013) as having \"significant pyritic damage\".\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Revenue administers applications for exemption from LPT\u00a0for residential properties that have been certified as having \"significant pyritic damage\". The property owner is specifically required to support a claim for the exemption by submitting a certificate, to Revenue, issued by a competent person as detailed in I.S. 398 \u00a0Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material   Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol, published by the NSAI. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I\u00a0initiated a review of the operation of the Local Property Tax (LPT) earlier this year. The Review was carried out by Dr Don Thornhill who chaired the Inter-Departmental Group on the Design of a local property tax in 2012. While Dr Thornhill's current review focussed mainly on the issue of property price developments, it\u00a0also considered and made recommendations on a limited number of other issues relating to the efficient and effective operation of LPT. I considered it appropriate that Dr Thornhill's review included the operation of the pyrite exemption for Local Property Tax.<\/p>  <p>  It was made clear during the passage of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act in 2013 that the exemption would be restricted to properties with significant pyritic damage, and that not all damaged properties could avail of the exemption. Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government in relation to testing\/certification and the NSAI protocol were published in May 2013 and these restricted the LPT exemption to properties with 'significant pyritic damage' where such damage had been proven by the appropriate testing and subsequently certified. <\/p>  <p>  Before its establishment, it would have been envisaged that the Pyrite Remediation Board (PRB) would have remediated those properties that would have qualified for a LPT exemption and that the requirement to have the level of pyrite damage verified and certified would be a pre-condition for remediation. However, it transpired that only properties with a damage condition rating of 2 are being accepted for remediation by the PRB. Also, I understand that the PRB is not testing and certifying all properties that are being remediated. This gives rise to two issues; firstly, properties with a damage condition rating of 1 (with progression) are not being accepted for remediation by the PRB and, secondly, not all properties that are accepted for remediation are tested and certified. A property owner who might have only a damage condition rating of 1, or 1 (with progression established by a second test), and who wants to claim the LPT exemption has to spend &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 on testing and certification. Properties with a damage condition rating of 2 are accepted for remediation but are not eligible for the LPT exemption unless as they have the required certificate. <\/p>  <p>  The outcome of \u00a0Dr Thornhill's Review\u00a0has been presented to me in report form and\u00a0is currently being considered\u00a0and will be published on Budget day.\u00a0 I will outline my response to this very important issue on Budget Day.<\/p>  <p>  Any resolution to the pyrite issues may necessitate a change in the relevant provisions of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) and\/or the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013.

It is worth noting that the statutory regime pursuant to which the CCMA was made has since been updated, as indeed has the version of the CCMA which was applicable in this case. The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.<\/p>  <p>  Where breaches of any regulatory requirements occur, firms and\/or individuals can expect vigorous investigation and follow through by the Central Bank. The Central Bank regularly conducts themed inspections to ensure compliance with all of its codes of conduct, including the CCMA.\u00a0 Breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with using appropriate supervisory powers, including Administrative Sanctions powers, where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  There is no legal issue, therefore, over whether or not regulated entities are to comply with this statutory code.\u00a0 Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the\u00a0CCMA and\u00a0non-compliance with the CCMA\u00a0is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.\u00a0 The precise issue that arose before the Courts was the extent to which non-compliance with the CCMA could be adjudicated by the Courts in a repossession case between a lender plaintiff and a borrower defendant.\u00a0 In that regard, the Supreme Court found that where a breach of the\u00a0CCMA involves a failure of the lender to abide with the moratorium referred in the CCMA, but in no other circumstances, non-compliance with the\u00a0CCMA affects a relevant lender's entitlement to obtain an order for possession.\u00a0 Following on from this, a breach of any other aspect of the\u00a0CCMA does not in itself adversely affect a lender's contractual right to possession in the circumstances of mortgage default.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court found that the CCMA prohibited lenders from seeking an order for possession where the moratorium was not complied with but that it did not prohibit the seeking of an order for possession in other circumstances. The Supreme Court has therefore ruled that where the Code of conduct prohibits the seeking of an order for possession the Courts will enforce that prohibition. To quote from the judgement of the Supreme Court:<\/p>  <p>  \"A financial institution which, entirely ignoring the provisions of the Code in that regard, simply went ahead and sought possession as soon as it was legally entitled so to do would be doing the very thing which the Code is designed to prevent. For a court to entertain an application for possession which was brought in circumstances of clear breach of the moratorium would be for a court to act in aid of the actions of a financial institution which were clearly unlawful (by being in breach of the Code) and in circumstances where the very act of the financial institution concerned in seeking possession was contrary to the intention or purpose behind the Code itself.\"<\/p>  <p>  Where the code does not so prohibit and where it is not illegal for an order of possession to be sought then it is not a matter in which the Courts will intervene: It should be noted that the purpose of the CCMA is\u00a0primarily to regulate the behaviour of the lenders concerned and it is principally a matter for the Central Bank to enforce the code and to regulate that behaviour rather than for the Courts. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the Supreme Court decision has in fact recognised that the CCMA forms part of the law and that a regulated financial institution is obliged, as a matter of law, to obey it. However, it should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory right to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.\u00a0 If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.\u00a0 Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,\u00a0 insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.\u00a0 Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the genuine concerns Deputies may have regarding the implications of the particular decision for borrowers in genuine difficulty with a mortgage on their own home.\u00a0 While the full implications of the decision can be considered further, I think the effect that most concerns Deputies\u00a0(that banks would not be obliged to consider\u00a0any alternative repayment arrangements to address a mortgage difficulty), can be practically addressed by the Central Bank utilising its existing powers.\u00a0 In any event the recent changes to the Land and Conveyancing Act and the Personal Insolvency Act has given a statutory right to a borrower to propose a sustainable solution to creditors, or failing that a court, as an alternative to repossession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900052#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900052#WRA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[32882\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900052#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains confident that economic progress is set to continue over the next five years, with particular reference to the encouragement of a well-balanced and integrated economy spread evenly throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>In the Spring Economic Statement, published in April of this year,\u00a0my Department forecast that\u00a0the economy would\u00a0grow by 4 per cent in 2015\u00a0and\u00a03.8 per cent in 2016.\u00a0On the basis of strong quarterly national account\u00a0results\u00a0for\u00a0the first and second quarters\u00a0of this year, these projections will be revised upwards in the\u00a0macroeconomic forecasts which will be published with the Budget in mid-October.\u00a0Importantly,\u00a0economic growth is now better balanced with exports and\u00a0domestic demand set to make a strong positive contribution to growth,\u00a0with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in  an increase in private consumption   the sacrifices made are now paying dividends. <\/p>  <p>   Over the medium term, my Department expects that\u00a0the economy can\u00a0grow by around 3\u00a0per cent per annum on a sustainable basis.

According to the CSO, the Gini coefficient for household disposable income in Ireland was 31.3% in 2013, the latest year for which data is available. This compares to 31.7% in 2004 and the Gini coefficient has remained within a narrow range over 2004 to 2013.

This report concluded that NAMA has\u00a0made significant progress in achieving its\u00a0overall objectives; and based on its performance and financial projections in light of the strength of current investor interest\u00a0in Ireland,\u00a0NAMA is well positioned to achieve its overall\u00a0objectives and so continues to be necessary. \u00a0<\/p><p>In the context of that review and as reiterated in\u00a0his opening address to the Public Accounts Committee on 18 December 2014, the NAMA Chief Executive\u00a0stated that NAMA aims\u00a0to redeem a cumulative 80% (&euro;24 billion) of its Senior Bonds\u00a0by the end of 2016 and that it hopes to have\u00a0redeemed all of its Senior Bonds\u00a0by the end of 2018\u00a0- two years ahead of NAMA's previous\u00a0target of 2020.\u00a0 He stated that these\u00a0targets are predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and on NAMA being in a position to retain sufficient specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual loan portfolio.  To date,\u00a0NAMA has\u00a0redeemed &euro;19.35bn, that is 64% of  the &euro;30.2\u00a0billion\u00a0Senior Bonds issued.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Deputy will\u00a0also be aware that,\u00a0entirely\u00a0consistent with its objectives,\u00a0the NAMA Board has undertaken to\u00a0protect its\u00a0ability to exercise a sufficient level of control to ensure the\u00a0timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office space within\u00a0the Dublin Docklands SDZ and Dublin's Central Business District and more generally to maximise the delivery of residential\u00a0housing units in areas of most need.<\/p><p>As set out in the\u00a0NAMA Act, one of the specific\u00a0purposes of NAMA is to deal expeditiously with the assets acquired by it.  I fully endorse the NAMA Board's strategy to\u00a0take advantage, to the greatest extent possible, of favourable Irish market conditions by increasing the flow of assets to the market.<\/p><p>Given that these\u00a0commitments were made by NAMA only in July 2014, it is too early to\u00a0speculate as what date in the future NAMA will have made sufficient progress on its objectives as to warrant consideration\u00a0of its dissolution. \u00a0I\u00a0will be obliged to\u00a0conduct another Section 227\u00a0review as of year\u00a0end 2017 and will again take\u00a0the opportunity to assess whether NAMA continues to be necessary at that point.<\/p><p>As regards accountability, it is again\u00a0important to point out that NAMA is already subject to a high level of public accountability compared to other commercial bodies, including commercial bodies in the State sector.<\/p><p>In carrying out its functions the Board\u00a0of NAMA must comply with its obligations under the NAMA Act.  The NAMA Board comprises seven members, five of whom, including the Chairman,\u00a0were Ministerial appointments.  The Chief Executive of NAMA and the Chief Executive of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) are ex-officio members of the Board.  The terms of office of Board members range between three and five years and no appointed member is eligible to serve more than two consecutive terms.<\/p><p>The NAMA Act (Section 18) sets out the principal responsibilities of the Board, which are<\/p><p>- to ensure that NAMA discharges its functions efficiently and effectively;<\/p><p>- to set strategic objectives and targets for NAMA;<\/p><p>- to ensure that the appropriate systems and procedures are in place to achieve the strategic targets and objectives;<\/p><p>- to take all reasonable steps available to it to achieve those targets and objectives.<\/p><p>The Board has also\u00a0established four statutory committees, under Section 32 of the Act, to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities and obligations: Audit Committee, Credit Committee, Finance and Operating Committee, Risk Management Committee. <\/p><p>NAMA's\u00a0Annual Report and Financial Statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. \u00a0The level of disclosure in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements is comprehensive and professional. \u00a0I\u00a0would encourage anyone interested in the workings and performance of NAMA\u00a0who have not yet\u00a0read these reports to take the time to do so as\u00a0they are a rich source of information regarding NAMA's performance. <\/p><p>NAMA is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information about its loans, its financing arrangements and its income and expenditure. These reports, which also include other information specified under Section 55 of the NAMA Act, track NAMA's\u00a0progress on a quarterly basis.\u00a0 I am obliged to lay these\u00a0reports before the Oireachtas and I endeavour to do so on a timely basis.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, under Section 53 of the NAMA Act,\u00a0NAMA is also required to submit to me an Annual Statement by 30 September each year setting out its proposed objectives for the following financial year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies and its proposed use of resources.\u00a0 I am obliged to lay these statements\u00a0before the Oireachtas and I endeavour to do so on a timely basis.\u00a0<\/p><p>NAMA's accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. For large parts of the year - typically between September and MayC&amp;amp;AG staff are based in the Agency, performing their audit function, with unrestricted access to all its records and files. \u00a0If there is concern about a specific aspect of NAMA's work, it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already produced three special reports on NAMA's activities and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing its complex business.\u00a0 I note that as part of its upcoming third Section 226\u00a0triennial review of NAMA, the C&amp;amp;AG has confirmed that it will perform a value for money review on various\u00a0NAMA sales transactions. <\/p><p>The Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) and other Oireachtas committees and to give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so - and most recently\u00a0attended the PAC on 9th July 2015. \u00a0I understand NAMA\u00a0are scheduled to appear before the PAC\u00a0again\u00a0on the morning of October 1st.  Transcripts of these appearances are available from the Oireachtas website.\u00a0 Furthermore, there have been numerous Parliamentary Questions addressed to me on NAMA-related issues and the associated replies are on the Oireachtas record.\u00a0<\/p><p>NAMA also recently\u00a0became subject to the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, 2014 on 14th April 2015.<\/p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, NAMA operates a dedicated email address, , to enable TDs and Senators to raise any\u00a0matter directly with the Agency.  I would encourage the Deputy, and indeed any member of the Oireachtas with a\u00a0NAMA-related\u00a0query, to avail of the email\u00a0service.  I am assured by NAMA that\u00a0all matters which are brought to its attention via this forum\u00a0are\u00a0fully, and promptly,\u00a0responded to.<\/p><p>Against this backdrop, I do not accept that there is a need to make NAMA more accountable than is already the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900053#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900053#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[32883\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900053#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the economic indicators continue to remain positive and capable of facilitating continued growth in the economy in the future, resulting in future job creation and the maximisation of opportunities for domestic investment and for foreign direct investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>In general, recent indicators have been very positive, indicating that the recovery is strengthening and becoming more broad based. <\/p>  <p>  The latest data show GDP increased by 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year.

This means that 120,000 people seeking asylum will be relocated to other EU Member States from Greece, Italy and any other State which may be hit by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries.  In a clear demonstration of solidarity with our EU partners, Ireland has committed &ndash; subject to Oireachtas approval - to opt in to this decision on relocation, as we have also committed to do in regard to the  previously agreed programme to relocate 40,000 people.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be seeking the approval of the Oireachtas for the exercise of the opt-in and officials in her Department are following up with the relevant EU authorities on the next practical steps involved.  <\/p>  <p>  The following day, 23 September, there was an extraordinary meeting of the European Council on the crisis.  There is broad agreement that a comprehensive approach is required to this complex issue, one which addresses both immediate humanitarian needs and the various factors which contribute to huge flows of people.  Progress is being made on many of the measures agreed at the April and June meetings of the European Council, including on reinforcing internal solidarity within the Union, developing &lsquo;hotspots&rsquo; (specific locations for the processing of asylum appeals) and increasing co-operation, with or support for, those countries from which most migrants originate or through which they pass. Increasing our support for the UN and other agencies working with refugees and displaced persons is another priority.  Targeting criminal people-smuggling operations is also key.

Over 13,700 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year, of which almost 4,300 are in Dublin, showing that significant numbers are being accommodated under the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants. Staff in the Community Welfare Service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness.

These include carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and the respite care grant.<\/p><p>Total expenditure by the Department on carers has increased from just under &euro;752 million in 2010 to almost an estimated &euro;822 million in 2014. This is an increase of &euro;70 million or just under 10%. The overall number of caring recipients has increased from just over 76,000 in 2010 to almost 84,000 recipients in 2014. This is an increase of 7,815 recipients or just over 10%. These increases demonstrate very clear evidence that, despite the need to stabilise Government finances, the welfare system continues to play a very positive role in protecting, family carers in our society.<\/p><p>In relation to payment rates, the Government has protected core weekly social welfare rates generally during its period in office, and there are no plans to reduce weekly rates of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit or the respite care grant. The appropriate rates of welfare supports in the year ahead, including payments to be made to carers, will be considered by Government as part of its deliberations on the next Budget. The means assessment for carer&rsquo;s allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system and I have no plans to make any changes in that area.<\/p><p>Carers can engage in employment, education or training, outside the home, for an aggregate total of 15 hours per week. This strikes a reasonable balance between giving carers the opportunity to engage with wider society and to maintain, where possible, a connection with the world of work and education, and meeting the requirement that carers are required to be providing full-time care and attention to a recipient of care.<\/p><p>When the caring role ends, due to the loss of a loved one or due to a permanent admission to a care home, working age carers may apply through the appropriate Intreo office, for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and receive assistance in developing a personal progression plan identifying appropriate actions to facilitate a return to work.<\/p><p>Currently, carer&rsquo;s benefit and carers allowance continue to be paid for a period of 6 weeks following the death of a recipient of care, and any change in these transition arrangements to extend the grace period can only be considered in the context of budgetary deliberations by government.<\/p><p>The respite care grant (RCG) is an annual payment of &euro;1,375 for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. The payment is made regardless of the carer's means but is subject to certain conditions, one of which is that the period of full-time care and attention must last for at least six months (which must include the first Thursday in June when the payment is made automatically to recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance\/benefit and domiciliary care allowance).<\/p><p>This year, RCG was paid to over 70,000 clients at an estimated cost of over &euro;124 million for the full year, and I should point out the grant, with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other social welfare group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.<\/p><p>Other supports from the Department for carers include free travel for recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance and, if they are living with the person they are caring for, the household benefits package.<\/p><p>Credited contributions (credits) are designed to protect the social insurance entitlement record of people, including carers, who are not in a position to make PRSI contributions.<\/p><p>Credits are awarded to recipients of carer's allowance\/benefits in the following circumstances: <\/p><blockquote>-if the claimant was employed and paid PRSI contributions prior to receiving carer's allowance s\/he may be entitled to credits. If, however, there is a gap of two years in the claimant's insurance record, credits are not valid until at least 26 PRSI contributions have been paid <br \/><br \/>-if the claimant was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance (provided s\/he has at least one paid Class A PRSI contribution), jobseeker's benefit or illness benefit immediately prior to claiming carer's allowance. <\/blockquote><p>In addition, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. This is achieved by disregarding years spent outside the workforce on such duties when calculating the average contributions per year on the pensioner&rsquo;s record. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, and\/or an incapacitated person, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.<\/p><p>The habitual residence condition (HRC), as provided for in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended), applies to claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions, guardian&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not qualified for these payments in Ireland. The purpose of this condition is to safeguard the social welfare system, by restricting access for people who are not economically active and who have little or no established connection with Ireland. Staff are trained in the application of the relevant HRC factors  in the case of carers and there are  no plans to change the HRC requirement at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900054#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Waiting Times","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900054#WRC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[32783\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900054#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the action her Department has taken to reduce and streamline processing times for social protection payments with a view to minimising hardship on those awaiting the outcome of applications; if she will support a system of automatic notifications between the Revenue Commissioners and her Department once a payment has been awarded, rather than self declaration; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The person on whose insurance record the claim was based was the deceased, or their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.  The overall concern in recent Budgets has been to protect primary social welfare rates. Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of approx. &euro;22 million.  This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension.  Accordingly, I have no plans to reinstate the bereavement grant as there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than that which was provided by the bereavement grant, including &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  -  The widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension which is a weekly payment, based on contributions or a means test. <\/p>  <p>  -  The widowed or surviving civil partner grant, which is a once-off payment of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child. <\/p>  <p>  -  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, continue in payment to qualified people for six weeks following a death.<\/p>  <p>  -  Guardians payments where someone is looking after an orphaned child. <\/p>  <p>  -  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.<\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs.

These schemes are administered locally by local development companies, Local Authorities and local not-for-profit sponsor groups.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The primary objective of these interventions is to support jobseekers, people with disabilities and other categories of customers in receipt of a social protection payment to receive training, work experience and\/or income support.  Various community services and activities are also directly and indirect supported by those who are engaged.  The interventions play an important role in upgrading the skill level of participants and provide an important link to the labour market by maintaining the work readiness of participants. T&uacute;s and gateway were introduced as a direct response to the growth in the level of unemployment during the financial crisis while number on community employment expanded.  <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">As the economic recovery takes hold and the overall level of unemployment falls, the Department recognises the need to adapt these schemes to the changing circumstances, opportunities and needs of jobseekers and others.  While the Department has no plans for a single scheme, it must however reflect the changing circumstances and underlying rationale and resource commitments for the number of interventions now being delivered.  The Department will continue to work with stakeholders in planning the longer term needs of jobseekers and other customers.

In addition, under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy an interdepartmental group will be established, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations on 'making work pay' for people with disabilities through examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities, and net income gains in employment.<\/p><p>In addition, a young person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the Intreo service on a voluntary basis and a complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities is available at Intreo Centres. The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in the Momentum programme. <\/p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee the main innovation in dealing with young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments relates to earlier engagement with this group than is normal under the general activation arrangements for unemployed people through INTREO. This will mean that young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments will be referred to a caseworker, and be engaged with more systematically in terms of their rights and responsibilities, at an earlier date than older unemployed people.

The employer can benefit from one or all, simultaneously. <\/p><p><i>Strand I subsidy<\/i>- is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a disabled person, in comparison to a non-disabled peer.  An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on 39 hour week.  <\/p><p><i>Strand II<\/i>- is based on the total number of disabled employees in a company, an employer can apply for a grant to cover additional costs ranging from an additional 10% for 3-6 employees to a maximum of 50% of the wage subsidy for 23+ disabled employees.<\/p><p><i>Strand III<\/i>- is where 30 or more disabled people are employed, employers can avail of a grant of &euro;30,000 per annum to assist with the cost of employing an Employment Assistance Officer.<\/p><p>Unlike other recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus, WSS is payable indefinitely as long as the disabled person remains in the employment concerned. New Applicants for WSS who are currently on Disability Allowance may apply for DA Disregard in conjunction with the WSS provided the minimum 21 working hours per week WSS threshold is maintained.<\/p><p><b>Disability Support\/Awareness<\/b><\/p><p>A number of different employment supports for people with disabilities are provided for under this heading. <\/p><p>A.

Over 13,700 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year, of which almost 4,300 are in Dublin, showing that significant numbers are being accommodated under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants. Staff in the Community Welfare Service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power (provided for under Article 38 of Statutory Instrument 412 of 2007) to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness. Tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate using the statutory discretion as outlined in the correspondence supplied by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 4,000 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans to extend this arrangement to Galway city. The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss these discretionary measures are implemented as appropriate.

Following\u00a0enactment, different parts of the 2012\u00a0Act have been commenced in tranches at different times. This approach was taken, as the Department is cognisant of the fact that credit unions needed time to implement all aspects of the 2012 Act and so has informed the timeline for implementation of the various measures on different dates.<\/p>  <p>  I have not yet signed a commencement order for the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 which covers the following areas: reserves; liquidity; lending; investments; savings; borrowing; systems, controls and reporting arrangements; and services exempt from additional services requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in\u00a0Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced\u00a0at end December 2015. \u00a0It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.\u00a0 These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the new sections into the 1997 Act by the 2012 Act will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank. The new sections will also contain a number of new requirements.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. <\/p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles,\u00a0it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>The regulations introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with the credit union sector and representative bodies, the Central Bank amended the transitional arrangement for the savings regulations to provide for credit unions that have individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at the commencement of the regulations to apply to the Central Bank to retain these savings where they can demonstrate that it is appropriate and prudent for them to do so. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.\u00a0 I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.\u00a0 The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.\u00a0 It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed.

Following\u00a0enactment,\u00a0specific\u00a0sections of the 2012\u00a0Act have been commenced at different times. This approach was agreed with credit union stakeholders, as the Department is cognisant of the fact that credit unions needed time to implement all aspects of the 2012 Act and this has informed the timeline for implementation of the various measures on different dates.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in\u00a0Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced\u00a0at end December 2015. \u00a0It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.\u00a0 These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. <\/p>  <p>  The remaining sections of the 2012 Act relate to: Reserves; Liquidity; Lending; Investments;\u00a0Savings; Borrowing; Systems, Controls and Reporting Arrangements; and Services Exempt from Additional Service Requirements.\u00a0The introduction of the new sections into the 1997 Act by the 2012 Act will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank. The new sections will also contain a number of new requirements.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the regulations credit unions will continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years. In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years). Approval will be subject to conditions set by the Central Bank. As indicated in CP88, the Central Bank is reviewing the conditions that currently apply for credit unions to be approved to extend their longer term lending limits.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The regulations introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with the credit union sector and representative bodies, the Central Bank amended the transitional arrangement for the savings regulations to provide for credit unions that have individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at the commencement of the regulations to apply to the Central Bank to retain these savings where they can demonstrate that it is appropriate and prudent for them to do so. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.\u00a0 I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted\u00a0and provided with additional\u00a0information on its application criteria\u00a0regarding the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.\u00a0 The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry of Credit Unions\u00a0will provide an application form and an explanatory notes to assist credit unions in making an application. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.\u00a0 It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.\u00a0 Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector\u00a0to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework.\u00a0As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is\u00a0absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900057#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Exemptions","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900057#WRF04250"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[32983\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900057#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of unfinished housing estates approved for exemption from the local property tax; if he will provide clarification in relation to the charge in respect of an unfinished estate (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"996","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[32984\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900057#WRF04350","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork, who previously gained exemption from the Revenue Commissioners for the local property tax, has now received correspondence from the Revenue Commissioners demanding payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, a property that is derelict to such an extent that it is not suitable for occupation (or not actually occupied) is not taxable. <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, it is up to a property owner to 'self-assess' as to whether a property is liable or not. This means that, in the case of LPT, there is normally no requirement on the owners of derelict property to declare such structures as taxable, unless the property owner receives a notification and\/or valuation estimate from Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  In such circumstances the onus is on the property owner to inform Revenue that the property is derelict and unfit for habitation.

This is a very important initiative, which will mean that NAMA will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates that it funds and that such housing will be delivered on site in line with Government policy aimed at ensuring greater integration in housing. <\/p>  <p>  The 6,500 residential properties made available by NAMA for social housing represents the totality of vacant residential properties within NAMA's portfolio that were potentially suitable for social housing.\u00a0\u00a0 The 4,000 residential properties not taken up for social housing have been either sold or rented in the private housing market and in that way have contributed to increased market supply.\u00a0\u00a0NAMA has no role in terms of determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities. The remaining properties made available by NAMA were ultimately deemed unsuitable by local authorities based on criteria such as their location and on wider planning and housing policy considerations or they were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers during the time taken by local authorities to assess and confirm their suitability. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this initiative, NAMA is funding the construction of new residential properties to help meet demand in the major urban centres.\u00a0 NAMA has, in this respect, committed to funding the construction of 4,500 new properties in the Dublin area in the three years to end 2016 and is firmly on track to achieve this target.\u00a0 Last year, NAMA funded the construction of nearly 50% of all new residential properties built in Dublin.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that approximately 7,599 acres of residentially zoned land secure its loans, however a proportion of this is in areas where there is limited or no demand for new supply whilst, within the main urban centres, residentially zoned land may not be suitable for development in the short to medium term for a number of reasons including\u00a0infrastructure deficits and other issues.\u00a0 NAMA has an active land strategy in place for every acre of residentially zoned land in areas where there is demand.\u00a0 Reflecting this, in Dublin NAMA has an exposure through its loans to approximately 30% of zoned residential land but is currently funding more than 40% of new housing output. <\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Dublin Housing Task Force, NAMA has identified all the Tier 1 lands (i.e. sites with potential to deliver more than 20 units) on its books with residential planning already in place. \u00a0These, along with all other non-NAMA Tier 1 sites in the Dublin area, have been published via an interactive map on the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government website.

Following the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) this changed with a number of supervisory responsibilities and decision making powers moving to the European Central Bank (ECB).<\/p>  <p>  The core objectives of the Bank in supervising Credit Institutions are: <\/p>  <p>  - to foster a stable banking system; <\/p>  <p>  - to provide protection to depositors with individual credit institutions <\/p>  <p>  As appropriate, the Bank's powers in respect of loan loss provisioning are limited to those prudential powers conferred on the Bank by the European Communities (Capital Adequacy of Credit Institutions) Regulations 2006 (i.e. the regulations transposing the European Capital Requirements Directive (CRD III)) and the European Union (Capital Requirements) Regulation 2014 and its other general supervisory powers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under Regulation 70 of the 2006 Regulations, the Bank was obliged to require any credit institution that did not meet the requirements of the 2006 Regulations to take the necessary actions or steps at an early stage to address the situation. Such measures included requiring credit institutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets, in terms of own funds requirements; obliging credit institutions to hold own funds in excess of the minimum level set out in Regulation 19; and requiring credit institutions to use net profits to strengthen the capital base. The Bank has comparable powers under Regulation 92 of the European Union (Capital Requirements) Regulation 2014. <\/p>  <p>  As the prudential regulator, the Bank aims to ensure that credit institutions are adequately capitalised at all times. It regards the issue of losses on loan portfolios as very important and aims to ensure that banks hold adequate capital in respect of such losses. \u00a0The Bank has not outsourced its responsibility for identifying losses at credit institutions. Under the Regulations, the Bank has the power to set overall capital adequacy standards and, depending on the circumstances, may rely on those powers to increase capital in the event provisions are assessed as inadequate. <\/p>  <p>  The Bank availed of this power under Regulation 70 in the case of the credit institutions subject to the Bank's Prudential Capital Assessment Review. A similar approach underpinned the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) approach under the 2014 Comprehensive Assessment exercise. I would expect the\u00a0Bank to utilise such powers in any cases where it assesses\u00a0a\u00a0bank's\u00a0provisioning to be\u00a0inadequate.<\/p>  <p>  The Bank has limited ability to influence provisioning practices within the confines of the existing accounting framework although it did publish Impairment Provisioning and Disclosure Guidelines in December 2011 which were revised and reissued in May, 2013.\u00a0 However, the Bank does not have legal power to require credit institutions to reclassify assets and\/or to increase their provisioning level beyond that required under IAS 39 for financial reporting purposes to shareholders. <\/p>  <p>  The European Communities (Credit Institutions: Accounts) Regulations 1992 contain specific requirements regarding the preparation of accounts by credit institutions and in principle, the Bank has power to bring proceedings in relation to a breach of those requirements. However, in respect of prosecuting credit institutions that fail to provide adequately for loan losses in their accounts, the power conferred on the Bank under Regulation 15 is of a very circumscribed nature, where the credit institution in question complied with either local GAAP or IFRS in preparing its accounts. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has no enforcement role regarding obligations imposed by the Companies Acts in respect of the maintenance of proper books of account and the preparation and publication of accounts which is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Neither has the Bank a role in enforcement of accounting standards which is a matter for the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900058#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Cost","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900058#WRG05000"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[33226\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900058#WRG05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total value of tax reliefs claimed by landlords of private rental accommodation under the allowable headings against the tax paid on their rental income in 2013 and 2014.","asker":"1193","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy.

In addition to providing an income tax relief, the HRI also aims to support tax compliance in the building industry by moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy.<\/p>  <p>  Seeing the success of the measure, and to provide some certainty to the sector, I have announced my intention to extend the HRI for a further year, until 31st December 2016. This will allow extra time for homeowners and landlords to make the necessary changes to their properties, and provide additional support to the construction sector for another year.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to a proposal to amend the scheme, I would point out that this is an income\u00a0tax relief, not a grant, and therefore individuals who have no income tax liability will not be eligible for this incentive. In order to assist those who are only liable for\u00a0small amounts of tax, the relief is granted over the two years following the year in which the\u00a0contractor is paid for the work. Where the credit cannot be used in these two years due to insufficient income tax, then the relief may be carried forward to the following year and each subsequent year until the relief has been used in full.<\/p>  <p>  For individuals who do not have any income tax liability, such individuals may be able to avail of other incentive schemes such as those administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. For example, the SEAI operate cash grants for certain works under the Better Energy Homes Scheme. In addition, they operate the Warmer Homes Scheme, under which work such as attic insulation can be carried out free of charge to qualifying individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900059#WRH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900059#WRH03450"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[33297\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900059#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of tax revenue that would be lost if the capital gains tax rate was lowered to 20%; the amount of additional tax revenue that would be gained if it was restored to 40%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of statistical information is available on the Commissioners' Statistics webpage: .

This comes on the back of an\u00a0increase of 7.2 per cent in the first quarter. As a result, GDP per capita is now above its pre-crisis peak. In the Spring Economic Statement, published in April of this year,\u00a0my Department forecast that\u00a0the economy would\u00a0grow by 4 per cent in 2015\u00a0and\u00a03.8 per cent in 2016.\u00a0On the basis of strong quarterly national account\u00a0results\u00a0for\u00a0the first and second quarters\u00a0of this year, I\u00a0expect\u00a0these projections to\u00a0be revised upwards in the\u00a0macroeconomic forecasts which will be published with the Budget in mid-October.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the recovery is now being felt in the domestic economy with consumption up over 3 per cent in the first half of this year and investment up over 20 per cent. In fact, last year domestic demand made its strongest positive contribution to economic growth since the crisis began. This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich. The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth with exports increasing by almost 14 per cent\u00a0in the first half of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had eleven successive quarters of solid annual employment growth. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost 6 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Over the medium term, my Department expects that\u00a0the economy can\u00a0grow by around 3\u00a0per cent per annum on a sustainable basis.   However, achieving a sustained economic recovery cannot be taken for granted and is contingent upon the implementation of the right policy mix. As set out in the Spring\u00a0Economic\u00a0Statement, the Government is using all policy instruments available to build\u00a0sustainable public finances, improve\u00a0access to credit and reform the\u00a0income tax system. A carefully targeted capital investment plan will\u00a0be\u00a0used to alleviate supply side bottlenecks and barriers to growth. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which I\u00a0established\u00a0will also contribute in this regard.  \u00a0The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements,\u00a0wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved to continue to attract foreign direct and indigenous investment.<\/p>  <p>  In summary,\u00a0I am confident that significant economic progress\u00a0can be made in the years ahead. But\u00a0crucially, \u00a0this is contingent upon implementing appropriate polices. That is what the Government intends to do.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inflation Rate","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[33364\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which any inflationary tendencies have been detected throughout the economy; if any corrective action is required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>The\u00a0annual rate of inflation, as measured by Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), was\u00a00.2 per cent in August, representing the fourth successive month of modest\u00a0positive inflation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The main factor depressing inflation over the past year or so has been energy prices.\u00a0 Core inflation - which strips out energy and unprocessed food - is a better indication of underlying developments in the domestic economy and has averaged around 1 per cent over the past year.\u00a0Low consumer price inflation is supporting household\u00a0disposable income and is one of the factors supporting consumption growth. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the annual rate of inflation will\u00a0pick-up gradually\u00a0as the domestic recovery continues, supported by quantitative easing, to rates\u00a0consistent with\u00a0price stability, i.e. close to but below 2 per cent, without the need for corrective action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[33365\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"whether the possibility of the utilisation of a Government development bond might be considered to address the ongoing housing shortage, in either the public or the private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>The proceeds of all borrowings by the Exchequer, as well as tax revenues, non-tax revenues and other receipts are lodged to the Exchequer account at the Central Bank of Ireland to fund on-going Government expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has advised that project-specific bonds issued by the State linked to a specific project and which are serviced and repaid from the Exchequer in the same way as standard Government bonds, may be of limited interest to investors due to the relative lack of liquidity.

The SBCI is currently in discussions with other banks and a number of non-bank providers of finance to provide products such as invoice discounting, leasing and asset based finance in order to broaden the funding options available to the SME sector and to support those providers with SBCI monies.<\/p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.\u00a0 The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department have worked on an amendment to the existing guarantee scheme to provide funding to SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish market. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included.<\/p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices\u00a0nationally to administer this fund.\u00a0This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness.<\/p><p>The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.They also examine\u00a0cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer, John Trethowan and his team, have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.\u00a0\u00a0Further details are available at\u00a0.  <\/p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the\u00a0key engine of ongoing economic growth.\u00a0 Consequently\u00a0the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[33371\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900060#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which banking charges and interest rates are in accord with those applicable throughout the eurozone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>All\u00a0credit institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities and\u00a0I have no statutory role in relation to\u00a0the charges applied by credit institutions. Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995\u00a0requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only. The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at . \u00a0Among the key findings of the review was that while\u00a0fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years,\u00a0net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their\u00a0European peers. <\/p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which\u00a0contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers. The website of the\u00a0Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)\u00a0also\u00a0lists the various charges imposed by financial institutions in Ireland\u00a0for different types of transactions .  The revised Payment Services Directive (known as PSD2) is currently being finalised at EU level and it is expected that Member States will be required to transpose the Directive by 2017. Among its other objectives, PSD2 is expected to promote competition, meaning increased choice and better conditions for consumers and businesses.<\/p><p>Irish financial\u00a0institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking. Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage. <\/p><p>On interest rates, Central Bank data contained in the Retail Interest Rates Statistical Release show that the rate on new floating rate loan agreements for house purchase (which includes renegotiations), was 3.35 per cent at end-July 2015, representing a decrease of 3 basis points over the month.

NAMA has a well-established\u00a0overriding commercial  mandate to recoup the best return for the Irish taxpayer and this has not changed. However, that does not mean that NAMA does not carry out\u00a0objectives, such as\u00a0facilitating the delivery of residential and social housing,\u00a0which are entirely\u00a0consistent with its existing purpose and objectives.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, it is important to note that NAMA does not build houses itself, rather it works with its existing debtors to agree development plans, secure\/alter planning permission and fund the debtor's delivery of units.\u00a0 Through these efforts NAMA are helping to increase the value of the security supporting the loans of its debtors and\u00a0so improving NAMA's\u00a0ultimate recovery on these loans.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, NAMA continues to\u00a0work closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning in relation to the delivery of residential housing, including social housing, and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As at mid-September 2015, I am advised that\u00a0NAMA had identified over 6,500 residential properties as potentially suitable for social housing.\u00a0 I am further advised that demand has been confirmed by local authorities for over 2,500 properties, of which 1,518 have been delivered for social housing use. NAMA also expects the end 2015 target of 2,000 social housing units will be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The 6,500 residential properties made available by NAMA for social housing represents the totality of vacant residential properties within NAMA's portfolio that were potentially suitable for social housing.\u00a0 The 4,000 residential properties not taken up for social housing have been either sold or rented in the private housing market and in that way have contributed to increased market supply.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  NAMA has no role in terms of determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities. The remaining properties made available by NAMA were ultimately deemed unsuitable by local authorities based on criteria such as their location and on wider planning and housing policy considerations or they were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers during the time taken by local authorities to assess and confirm their suitability. <\/p>  <p>  All applicants for residential development, irrespective of who the funder is, must comply with the relevant planning and housing policy, including Part V policy relating to the provision of social housing which the Deputy referenced.\u00a0As Minister for Finance, I\u00a0do not have\u00a0role in relation to\u00a0the application of the Part V\u00a0policy in respect of any individual development. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA has\u00a0indicated that Part V units\u00a0within new residential developments funded by it could be delivered through its social housing SPV, NARPS.\u00a0 This\u00a0would mean that the upfront capital cost of constructing such units would be borne by NAMA.\u00a0 This may reduce the funding burden otherwise placed on\u00a0financially constrained local authorities.\u00a0 These units then could be leased under long term leasing arrangements for social housing.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, NAMA is also\u00a0playing a key role in providing support to the wider\u00a0residential market by boosting supply. With exposure to less than one-third of Dublin's residential development land, NAMA funding delivered 40% of the 3,259 new housing units in Dublin in 2014 and in the first half of 2015 funded the delivery of 50% of new output in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Dublin Housing Task Force, NAMA has identified all the Tier 1 lands (i.e. sites with potential to deliver more than 20 units) on its books with residential planning already in place. \u00a0These, along with all other non-NAMA Tier 1 sites in the Dublin area, have been published via an interactive map on the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government website. This action has brought greater transparency to the Dublin market by publically providing detailed information on sites with development potential.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2014, as part of its contribution to address emerging residential supply shortages in the Greater Dublin area, NAMA established a dedicated Residential Delivery team to coordinate and drive the delivery of this commitment and assess the potential for delivery of additional units thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that NAMA also has security over 156 or 17% of the 992 unfinished housing estates in the country   down from 268 of 1,258 at end 2013.

In such circumstances, it is anticipated that the time frame to reach mediation will be three weeks.<\/p>  <p>  All first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard in private by WRC Adjudication Officers. The Adjudication Officer will convene a hearing where both parties are given the opportunity to be heard and to decide the matter.  Parties will be free to represent themselves or choose their own representation.  All appeals will lie to the Labour Court (except in the case of complaints under the Equal Status Acts where the appeal will lie to the Circuit Court). The target waiting time for a hearing under the new structures will be three months from the time of referral of the complaint to hearing. <\/p>  <p>  The deputy will wish to be aware that, as part of the workplace relations reform process, additional adjudicators have been selected through the Public Appointments Service.

As of Q2 2015, there were an additional 126,000 at work in the economy since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs, which achieved and exceeded the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 extra at work by 2016. The services sector made the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 more at work. Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, I am pleased to report that the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made by Government in supporting job creation and in reducing unemployment rates in all regions of the country, including Dublin. By Q2 2015 the number at work in Dublin had risen to 591,800, an additional 88,000 from Q1 2012. As of Q2 2015 the unemployment rate in Dublin was down to 8.1% from 13.1% in early 2012. The number of unemployed in Dublin has reduced from 75,800 in early 2012 to 51,800 in Q2 2015 according to the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey. <\/p>  <p>  While progress has been made, this Government is not complacent about the challenge of achieving sustainable full employment over the medium term, in all regions including Dublin. As part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs we launched the process for developing Action Plans for every region and the work on the preparation of the Dublin Action Plan for Jobs is currently commencing. Two areas of particular focus will be how we can generate future entrepreneurship and investment in manufacturing and services sectors of the economy.  <\/p>  <p>  Arising from the strategy for the manufacturing sector &lsquo;Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020&rsquo;, prepared by Forf&aacute;s and the report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs Skills Report on the skills needs for the sector, both of which I launched in 2013, there are now a range of initiatives being progressed by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the Government&rsquo;s jobs targets. In recent weeks I launched a new guide for manufacturing enterprises on the supports available through the state bodies and agencies to support new and existing employment. <\/p>  <p>  Manufacturing was a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and is a key focus in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs and also in the regional Action Plans for Jobs, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting indigenous companies and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative. The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Strategy recommendations. These initiatives are important to growing and sustaining the competitiveness of existing enterprises, to sustaining employment and to attracting new investment. <\/p>  <p>  For both manufacturing and services sectors, skills and talent development and attraction are critically important. We have a good skills base on which to grow our manufacturing and services sectors and as the economy recovers there will be further opportunities for the unemployed. My Department and its agencies has a Protocol in place with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that where new job openings are available, that there is an efficient and timely matching between those unemployed and skills required by enterprise and that appropriate training or development is available. The Apprenticeship Council has also recently announced a number of new apprenticeships to meet the current and future skills needs of manufacturing and services sectors. These new apprenticeships will also provide a range of opportunities for the long terms and youth unemployed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900061#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900061#WRK02650"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[33296\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900061#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason employment in the computer games industry has not risen during his period in office; his plans to stimulate employment in this modern computer industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>The games sector experienced considerable growth in Ireland in recent years, with many of the sector&rsquo;s largest global players having established operations in Ireland. The games sector in Ireland encompasses a broad breadth of areas for example the Irish operations of Activision and Culture Translate demonstrate the capabilities that exist in games localisation.  The indigenous game studios demonstrate the games development, platform development\/porting capabilities in Ireland (e.g. Digit, Six Minute Games).  The strengths in technology development\/middleware are evidenced by Havok (Intel), Swrve, and DemonWare (ActivisionBlizzard).  The operations of Riot, Webzen, and Red5Studios highlight the broader publishing capabilities here.  And, the customer service &amp;amp; community management activities in EA, Blizzard, Riot and Zynga demonstrate the ability of Ireland to support multilingual, pan-European, high end customer support activities.Ireland has produced exciting start-up companies some of which have had a major impact within the global industry, including Havok (Intel) and Demonware (ActivisionBlizzard) and Ireland continues to have a hotbed of very early stage start-ups and independent games designers, with new entrants every year.<\/p><p>Tracking of employment in the games industry and related activities is difficult to assess definitively due to data classification limitations in official statistics, and also the small scale of many of the independent Irish owned operations. Analysis undertaken by Forf&aacute;s in 2011 estimated that total employment in the sector stood at around 2,200 having experienced a five-fold increase from a low base of an estimated 400 in 2004. This was driven mainly by rapid growth in foreign direct investment in the sector over the period, particularly in activities such as customer and technical support, community management and games localisation.<\/p><p>In tandem with this growth, there has also been considerable expansion within the broader consumer internet sector (including social media and mobile internet) to which a large part of the games industry is inextricably linked. Ireland now has a very strong Internet and social networking cluster in existence &ndash; thanks to significant investments in EMEA Operations Centres from leading companies such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, eBay, PayPal, Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo, etc. A wider base of related activities can also be considered part of the games ecosystem, although it is difficult to assess the degree to which these are connected to the industry in Ireland; these activities include: software development, financial services, online gambling, information security, animation &amp;amp; film production, and creative arts (music, art, literature).<\/p><p>The talent base associated with this broad range of activities is a significant attractiveness factor in new games sector enterprise investments. Ireland also possesses a long history and tradition in technical and creative content development, through our innate storytelling abilities seen through the success of our animation industry to the international recognition of Ireland today as a centre of excellence for technology investment. Investment in Ireland&rsquo;s broadband\/internet infrastructures also has had a strong role to play in underpinning new activity in the games sector in recent years.<\/p><p>Since 2011, there have been a number of new investments by foreign owned games companies, the most recent being Kama Games, a global developer and publisher of social games for mobile platforms which is headquartered in Dublin who announced an expansion of up to 100 jobs over the next 3 years (announced July 2015).  Others have departed the scene (such as Big Fish and PopCap) reflective of the ongoing disruptive competitive forces within the games sector globally.<\/p><p>The Irish owned element of the Irish games cluster is still relatively young by international standards but its reputation is growing and awareness within the investor community to the attractiveness of the Irish games sector is increasing. A number of Irish games startups (in middleware and content) have raised seed and follow on series &lsquo;A&rsquo; funding investments over the last 24 months. Current exports from the Irish owned segment account for over 95 percent of their turnover and are oriented towards the UK and North American markets in the main. Linkages with international games publishers are key to the growth of the games content developers. The marketing of games is very expensive and publishers have the monies and users to enable a small Irish company create a hit game.<\/p><p>CEOs are collaborating in a structured way to grow the cluster to the next stage of international growth through industry representative groups such as Games Ireland. Indigenous indie developers have recently set up a new representative body called &lsquo;Imirt&rsquo;  ().<\/p><p>Subsequent to the publication of the Forf&aacute;s Report on the sector in 2011 (The Games Sector in Ireland: An Action Plan for Growth), Minister Bruton, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2012, established a Clustering Development Team (CDT) for the Games Sector on 25 July 2012 to support the implementation of actions called for in the Report.  This industry-chaired group comprised representatives of leading Irish and multinational games companies based in Ireland, as well as representatives of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Forf&aacute;s, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S, HEA and the Higher Education Institutes\/Colleges of Further Education.<\/p><p>The ambitions for the CDT are to drive &lsquo;on-the-ground&rsquo; collaboration and networking by proactively developing relationships between the foreign and indigenous cohort of games companies, HEIs and related sectors along with seeking to influence the policy system. The CDT  provides a forum for discussion of issues for industry, enterprise support agencies, the education system and policy Departments.<\/p><p>A series of specific actions set out in the Action Plans for Jobs have been delivered on since the establishment of the CDT. These included activities in order to heighten awareness within the sector of the existing R&amp;amp;D supports available to the Games sector. The enterprise agencies held a number of R&amp;amp;D supports workshops and issued an enterprise friendly guide on R&amp;amp;D tax credits which included examples of relevance to games companies. The Department worked with the industry members of the group to assess the case for introducing a new specific financial instrument\/relief for the Games industry and in 2014, a proposal was made to the Department of Finance for the introduction of a refundable corporation tax credit for the games sector, along the lines of what has been introduced in the UK and France.<\/p><p>A further key area of activity for the group has been to promote the increase in collaboration between industry and HEIs\/Training providers in terms of mentoring and course content.  A pilot &ldquo;hothouse&rdquo; initiative for undergraduate and Post-Leaving Certificate courses was devised and run in late 2013, which saw students from games, animation and multimedia courses working in multi-disciplinary teams on projects supported by an industry mentor.<\/p><p>In order to promote industry engagement with the development of curriculum of games courses, a leading games expert visited Ireland for six weeks in September and October 2014 as part of a Fulbright U.S. Specialist Award in conjunction with the HEA and carried out master classes and curriculum reviews of Digital Games courses at a number of Irish universities and colleges. She also met with industry representatives and government agencies and had very constructive meetings with Minister English in respect of enterprise and Minister O&rsquo;Sullivan in respect of education.<\/p><p>My Department continues to support the Games sector through the enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. As with other companies in the technology and creative sectors, games companies can avail of the direct supports provided by the enterprise agencies such as the Competitive Start Fund, Seed Capital, In-market and Management development, R&amp;amp;D funding and tailored company expansion packages. A range of financial instruments also exists to assist companies which are not sector specific.<\/p><p>A number of the existing venture funds have and will continue to invest in a range of Irish owned software related projects including businesses in the digital game space (Seed and later stage). Enterprise Ireland (EI) has also co invested. EI&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund (&euro;50k equity) has also had a significant impact on the early stage indigenous games sector since December 2010. Over this period, EI has funded over 20 Games companies to date. The companies include Batcat Games, Bitsmith, Redwind, Tribal City and Gone Gaming. R&amp;amp;D support is available for companies as they mature to cash generating businesses. The cohort has also availed of a number of start-up management development programmes to date (including iGap&amp;amp; Sprint).<\/p><p>At the request of Government I am currently finalising a new Enterprise Policy 2025 strategy, which will identify a number of sectors\/activities with future growth potential. The creative sector is one such example, of which the games industry is a part and we will work to ensure the employment growth potential of the sector is realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900061#WRK02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900061#WRK02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Severe Weather Events","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900061#WRK02850"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[32729\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900061#WRK02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide a reinstatement grant to persons whose forestry was damaged in the storm in February 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>I am aware of the difficulties that have been created for many forest owners as a result of the storms of 2014.

The design of the measure has been informed by experience from previous discussion groups, extensive stakeholder consultation and the relevant articles from the respective EU regulations.  Participants are required to attend Knowledge Transfer (KT) group meetings and complete a Farm Improvement Plan.  I believe that the combination of both farmer knowledge exchange meetings and one to one interaction between the farmer and advisor in the development of a Farm Improvement Plan will ensure the transfer and exchange of information and best practice to participating farmers.  The analysis of previous discussion group schemes and consultations leading up to the design of the KT Programme highlighted the importance of addressing all aspects of a farming enterprise including profitability, environmental sustainability, farm safety and animal health and welfare measures.  This is reflected in the scheme design which includes the requirement for a private veterinary practitioner (PVP) to oversee the preparation of an individual animal health and welfare plan.  While a payment to cover the PVP&rsquo;s involvement is not an eligible cost under the relevant article covering knowledge transfer, the time spent by the farmer in completing the Animal Health Measure aspect of the Farm Improvement Plan is and has been included in the total payment to participating farmers.  Over the period of the programme this totals &euro;160. In effect this reduces the PVP cost over the period of the programme by &euro;160, thereby significantly reducing the net PVP cost.<\/p>  <p>  Participation in more than one Knowledge Transfer group across sectors is not permitted.  This is largely due to potential double funding which would arise from the completion of more than one Farm Improvement Plan for a single farming enterprise.

A significant innovation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 was the introduction of a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality in their work and conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with individual human rights.  The Commission will assist public bodies to comply with the positive duty, including by producing guidelines and codes of practice. This means the systematic integration of an equality and human right perspective into everyday work, including changes to organisational cultures so that such a perspective is an integral part of the organisation.   This innovation puts the promotion and protection of human rights at the heart of our domestic and foreign policies, and as the Deputy is aware, our Constitution places strong emphasis on fundamental rights and predates both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p>  <p>  We have in place a range of human rights action plans or strategies targeted at specific groups. We have sectoral strategies in place to safeguard, promote and further the rights of groups or sectors within society, such as people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma, older people, migrants, and carers, for example.  We also have strategies in place to promote gender equality, tackle domestic and sexual-based violence, and promote social inclusion.  As human rights and equality issues cross the whole of Government, the Cabinet Committee system plays an important role in ensuring coordination and a holistic approach on relevant issues.  Our current system of focusing our energies on specific sectoral approaches allows us to respond with agility to suggestions emerging from our ongoing working relationship and consultations with civil society; a good example of this would be the proposals for an LGBTI strategy or roadmap which I announced in recent days.<\/p>  <p>  I am open to the idea of a developing a National Action Plan on Human Rights, if it were clear that a such general, overarching plan would bring added value to the considerable work already being undertaken.

The following arrangements are now in place in an effort to improve throughput and relieve the congestion in the public office that occurs at this time of the year as demand for registration increases as students return to their studies. The aim is to reduce the number of persons who are required to call to the office to a minimum and on a par with the number who call at all other times of the year where no significant issues with queuing arise.<\/p><p>Beginning immediately, persons who are students of the colleges listed below and who are registering for the first time or seeking to renew their registrations should not<b><\/b>attend at the Public Office.  Separate arrangements are being put in place to register students of these colleges later in the autumn and these arrangements will be communicated directly to the colleges and students involved.  There is no need for students of these colleges to queue at Burgh Quay and no person will lose residence status or continuity of permission to remain by the application of these arrangements.  The colleges concerned are:<\/p><p>- Dublin City University (DCU),<\/p><p>- Dublin Institute of Technology and constituent colleges (DIT)<\/p><p>- Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI),<\/p><p>- Dublin University (Trinity College),<\/p><p>- University College Dublin (UCD).<\/p><p>Commencing on Wednesday 30th September, all new registrations will be dealt with on Monday and Tuesday each week.  Wednesday to Friday is reserved for renewal of registrations i.e. for those who have an existing GNIB registration certificate.  In addition to these measures, extra staff resources are being deployed to the GNIB to assist with the registration process.  Weekend opening is also being arranged: the Public Office was open on 26th September and a date of 10th October has been announced, and further dates will be announced shortly.  The arrangements will be kept under constant review and changed or added to as required to address the demands on the office in this peak period.<\/p><p>The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to 500 people who are dealt with in the peak period at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8 am to 9 pm each Monday to Thursday and 8 am to 6 pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at the office; priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business.  This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs.  In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an announcement is posted on the Garda website alerting customers to the number of available tickets remaining at the Burgh Quay public office for that day.  Furthermore, those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.<\/p><p>In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at my offices.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  For the majority of customers the Garda National Immigration Bureau provides a <i>&lsquo;<\/i>same day service<i>&rsquo;<\/i>at its Burgh Quay office.  Currently, this office handles all registrations in the Dublin area.  At times of high demand, it is not possible, currently, to send this demand elsewhere, it has to be accommodated within the capacity of the Burgh Quay office where the necessary technical infrastructure for registration card recording, generation of registration certificates and fingerprinting exists.  Use of other buildings for this purpose is not an option because the biometric equipment and elaborate smart card production systems are not mobile and in any event has to be linked up in real-time to the Garda IT systems.<\/p><p>Work is underway to transfer the registration function to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  As part of that work new systems are being developed with the aim of reducing footfall and random arrivals to the public office by use of on-line systems and to undertake registrations renewals off-site.<\/p><p>I would like to acknowledge the work of the staff in the Public Office who diligently perform a very important function for the State.  It is one of the busiest public offices in the State dealing with, in the region of, 100,000 people every year.  The new arrangements outlined above mean that queuing is not necessary and these arrangements will be strictly enforced to ensure that they are implemented as effectively as possible.  I am anxious that queuing be reduced to the absolute minimum at the earliest possible opportunity whilst remaining consistent with the requirement to protect our immigration system from abuses.  I am confident that the measures outlined above will further improve the services provided to customers calling to this office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900065#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed Circuit Television Systems","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900065#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[33272\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900065#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to set down her plans to provide closed circuit television at a location (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention, and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access such as town centres, fall into two distinct categories: Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.<\/p>  <p>  Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's identified operational needs and priorities.

To date, two progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.

Currently, HSE Estates is in consultation with the hospital's clinical leads to ensure that the project's specification and building tender documents are fully defined as soon as is possible.

In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.

The new institutions as agreed by the Stormont House Agreement provide for different ways of dealing with the past.  The new Historical Investigations Unit provides for police investigation and, where there is an evidential basis, the prospect of justice.  The Stormont House Agreement makes clear that this will be an independent body.  The Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, to be established by the two Governments, is intended to allow individuals to seek information about troubles related deaths where there is no realistic prospect of prosecution; information provided to the Commission for this purpose would not be admissible in court. <\/p>  <p>   In addition, an Oral History Archive will be established.  These bodies will be overseen by an Implementation and Reconciliation Group, with a mandate to promote reconciliation, a better understanding of the past and to reduce sectarianism.   <\/p>  <p>  I believe that taken together these four mechanisms provide an opportunity to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in a way which upholds the rule of law and facilitates justice, acknowledges and addresses the needs of victims and survivors, is human rights compliant, and above all promotes reconciliation. <\/p>  <p>  It is now crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing these institutions is completed and this is one of the central objectives of the current round table talks involving the five main Northern Ireland parties and the British and Irish Governments. <\/p>  <p>  For these institutions to function effectively, it is vitally important that they have public trust and confidence. This is why I have placed the principle of independence at the centre of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the establishment of the institutions.  I agree that public consultation on the establishment of the institutions is also important in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of the commitments in the Stormont House Agreement, including those related to the past, pertain to matters within the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and are the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive.  However, in order to expedite the establishment of the legacy institutions, the British Government has agreed to bring forward the required legislation in Westminster.  It is therefore the responsibility of the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to consider the question of a public consultation within its jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to legislating within this jurisdiction to fulfil the commitments of the Irish Government under the Stormont House Agreement, the normal parliamentary process and scrutiny will of course apply.  I and my colleagues in Government have a very open dialogue with families and victims and survivors groups.  Issues relating to the new legacy institutions have been discussed with them on a number of occasions and this has helped guide the Government&rsquo;s approach.  We will of course continue this active engagement in the context of bringing forward the required domestic legislation to establish and cooperate with the new legacy institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900070#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1015,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900070#WRT02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1016,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[32820\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900070#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of an application for an extension to a working visa for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1080","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1017,"content":"<p>Australian citizens do not require a visa to enter Ireland.

I expect that some 8,000 households will benefit under the schemes in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  My Department works with local authorities to ensure a full drawdown of their allocation. Through careful management of my Department&rsquo;s housing budget in 2014, additional funds were made available to local authorities with high levels of grant activity.

The HAP scheme removes a barrier to employment, by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment, it improves regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and it provides certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  To be eligible for HAP, a person must first apply for and be approved for social housing support by their local authority.<\/p><p>Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the tenancy agreement is between the HAP recipient and the private landlord.<\/p><p>The first phase of the statutory pilot for the HAP scheme commenced in September 2014 and has been introduced incrementally to 13 local authority areas to date-Limerick City and County Council; Waterford City and County Council; Cork, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin, Monaghan, Donegal, Offaly, Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils; and Cork City Council.  Dublin City Council is also implementing the HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months.<\/p><p>For the purposes of the statutory pilot, Limerick City and County Council have been acting as the lead authority in respect of the HAP project and are providing a transactional shared service hub for all local authorities operating HAP during the pilot phase.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets a target of 8,400 households to be supported by HAP by end 2015.  To date, there are over 4,000 households being supported by HAP across the pilot local authority areas operating the scheme.  As the HAP scheme is being rolled out on a phased pilot basis, formal targets for individual local authority area swere not set for 2015.  However, projected HAP tenancies have been determined and the relevant local authorities are working to achieve these. <\/p><p>Each Chief Executive of a local authority is responsible for staffing and organisation arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  My Department works closely with all local authorities and all have been invited to submit staffing sanction requests to facilitate the delivery of the <i>Social Housing Strategy.<\/i>Each staffing sanction request is examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints.  My Department has sanctioned 36 posts to date to provide for the delivery of HAP across all Local Authorities.<\/p><p>While securing accommodation under HAP can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation nationally under HAP continues to rise, with an average of 90 new tenancies being registered each week in 2015.\u00a0 The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are currently based on the rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).\u00a0 In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.\u00a0 My Department works closely with DSP and monitors data which it gathers, along with data gathered by HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.<\/p><p>In this context, I have recognised that South Dublin County Council required additional flexibility in the operation of HAP given the challenging rental market within its administrative area.  Regulations were signed in July 2015 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself to provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the previous maximum rent limits in South Dublin, where such flexibility is necessary in order to secure a suitable dwelling for the household concerned.  My Department continues to keep this matter under active review in all HAP pilot authority areas, including Louth County Council.<\/p><p>In relation to the operation of HAP in the administrative area of Louth County Council, the scheme has been piloted there since 1 October 2014.  There are currently 500 households being supported by HAP, with an average of 12 HAP tenancies being set-up per week in 2015.  While my Department doe s not hold a detailed breakdown , by local authority, of landlords who are receiving payments on behalf of HAP households, I understand that there are some 361 landlords or agents acting on behalf of landlords currently receiving HAP payments in the administrative area of Louth County Council. The total amount paid to landlords by the HAP transactional shared service hub in respect of these tenancies to date in 2015 is &euro;1,496,624.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department has also met on a regular basis with the pilot local authorities, including Louth County Council, to provide briefing in relation to the scheme and to get their feedback on operational matters.  This engagement is proving invaluable as the roll out of the scheme progresses.  I am pleased at how the HAP scheme is being operated within the administrative area of Louth County Council and I would like to commend the local authority on its engagement with the scheme to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900076#WRZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":1332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900076#WRZ01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Internet Safety","counter":1331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900076#WRZ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1332,"qnumday":601,"qnumall":"[32736\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900076#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position in relation to future and likely policy developments on Internet privacy and data protection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1333,"content":"<p>Internet governance concerns the development and application of shared principles, procedures and mechanisms that inform and affect how the internet functions and how people use the internet.

These safeguards included an Ecological and Screening Assessment of the proposed film work, as well as stringent bio-security protocols.

A condition of the consent is that the salary costs and expenses of my Department&rsquo;s staff will be met by the film company.<\/p><p>Section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930 (as amended) provides that, in the case of a national monument such as Skellig Michael, Ministerial consent must be obtained for any proposals:<\/p><p>(a) to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter, or in any manner injure or interfere with any such national monument, or<\/p><p>(b) to excavate, dig, plough or otherwise disturb the ground within, around, or in proximity to any such national monument, or<\/p><p>(c) to sell for exportation or to export any such national monument or any part thereof.<\/p><p>The film producer&rsquo;s proposals were carefully considered by my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service in that context.

The National Monuments Service also gave advance notice of the filming to UNESCO's World Heritage Centre in Paris.<\/p><p>My decision to grant consent in this case was notified to UNESCO and the European Commission and neither body has indicated any issues with the process and its outcome.

Following receipt of the Committee's report, it is my intention to bring the matter to Government for decision in the near future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900078#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Council","counter":1461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900078#WRBB03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1462,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[33431\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092900078#WRBB03100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the steps she will take given the recent publication of the comprehensive value for money report on the Arts Council and arts funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1463,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.

It was undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit under the guidance of an expert Steering Committee chaired by Dr. John O'Hagan, Professor of Economics at Trinity College.  The review commends the Council for its response to the economic crisis by significantly reducing administration costs; overhauling its organisational structures; and developing on its RAISE initiative, which helps arts organisations to diversify funding streams.<\/p><p>The review also highlights the need for the Council to expand its efforts to improve transparency around its decision making; give greater consideration to addressing the issue of regional balance in accessing the arts; and to engage more with stakeholders and establish the evidence-base for the societal benefits of its work.<\/p><p>The Value for Money Policy Review should act as an important tool for the Arts Council to improve its hugely beneficial work in funding arts organisations across the State.
