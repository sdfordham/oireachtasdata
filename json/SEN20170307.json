I welcome the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>I would like to raise the issue of the proposed Milltown group sewerage scheme.  Milltown is located north west of Monaghan town and is typical of the outskirts of Monaghan, where ribbon development and unseweraged housing clusters have developed on the periphery of the town.  Residents in Milltown recently formed a group sewerage scheme.  They employed a consultant engineer and concluded that the most viable and economic option for the group sewerage scheme was to connect to the main sewer by connecting to a nearby existing housing development called Telaydan Heights.  Milltown group sewerage scheme consists of approximately 30 domestic members and 32 commercial members.  Funding was approved by the Department under the rural water programme for the scheme 2014 to 2015.  There were some outstanding legal matters that needed to be addressed and as a result the scheme did not proceed.  However, agreement has since been obtained by the group to connect to a local sewer pump in Telaydan Heights.<\/p> <p>The Blackwater, which is the largest river in County Monaghan, and one of the most substantial catchments of Ulster, is close by.  The houses in the Milltown area of Monaghan are serviced by domestic on-site wastewater treatment systems.  The risk of environmental pollution to the Blackwater from these septic tanks is very high due to the age, construction, subsoil conditions, vulnerability and close proximity to the Blackwater River and its catchment streams.  Monaghan town and its environs are constructed directly over a regionally important limestone mass which means, in layman's terms, that the Monaghan public water supply comes from that area.  It is alarming that the septic tanks, which cause pollution, could be interfering with the water supply there.  The Milltown group sewerage scheme's primary aim is to extend the wastewater collection infrastructure, to serve the ribbon developments and unseweraged housing clusters within the area.  It is a matter of connecting 32 septic tanks, which are problematic, into the main sewer.<\/p> <p>Milltown group sewerage scheme proceeded to tender in 2016 with an estimated cost for the full scheme of &euro;358,000.  The Department, assisted by an expert panel, reviewed and prioritised group schemes throughout the country under the multi-annual programme for 2016 to 2018.  Milltown was a scheme prioritised for funding along with six others throughout the country.  It is estimated that 90% funding would be required for this scheme to proceed, as the minimum contribution per household would be &euro;2,250.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is estimated that they would need 90% funding, as the minimum contribution per household would be &euro;2,250.  There is another scheme where the funding is 75% but that would leave the cost to the householder too expensive and would thus make the whole scheme unviable.  That scheme, therefore, requires 90% funding in order that it can proceed to construction stage.<\/p><p>Monaghan County Council's environmental section has done great work on this scheme and fully supports it.  It is vitally important that the funding will be allocated, hopefully this year, to this scheme so that the 30 septic tanks can be connected to the main sewer and pollution can cease.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to provide a date for the commencement of this funding.  When will the 90% funding be allocated in order to make that happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#B00200","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this issue in order to bring some clarity to it.  My Department&rsquo;s new multi-annual rural water programme 2016-2018 includes funding of group sewerage schemes, through measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective.<\/p> <p>In December 2015, my Department received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the maximum grant per house to &euro;6,750 - up from &euro;6,500 - to cover a limited number of new demonstration group sewerage schemes, namely, two per year.  In addition, sanction was also given for these new demonstration group sewerage schemes, in exceptional circumstances, to avail of a supplemental grant, subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval, where the project represents the most economically advantageous option.  Where a supplemental grant is approved, the overall level of funding from the rural water programme is limited to 90% of the cost per house subject to a minimum contribution of &euro;2,250 per house.<\/p> <p>Local authorities were invited in January 2016 to submit bids for consideration by my Department under the new multi-annual rural water programme 2016-2018, as Senator Gallagher mentioned.  A proposed Milltown group sewerage scheme was included by Monaghan County Council under measure 4(d).  The proposed scheme, with an estimated cost of &euro;280,000, would cover 32 houses and have a unit cost of &euro;8,750 per house.<\/p> <p>In total, 83 bids were received from 17 local authorities requesting funding under this measure.  Under the new multi-annual funding framework, an expert panel was convened by my Department to examine the 2016 bids from local authorities for projects under a number of the programme&rsquo;s measures, including measure 4(d), and to make recommendations to the Department on funding.  The panel recommended a priority list under this measure, including the Milltown scheme at priority five, and my Department accepted the panel&rsquo;s recommendations in full when approving the rural water allocations for 2016.<\/p> <p>As only two demonstration group sewerage schemes can be advanced in any given year, funding will not be available to Monaghan County Council for the Milltown scheme until 2018, unless a scheme prioritised higher than Milltown by the council is not in a position to be advanced this year, whereby in which case the Milltown scheme would be given a higher priority.  It is intended to make interim funding allocations under the programme to the local authorities by the end of March 2017 and any re-prioritisation of the Milltown scheme would be notified to Monaghan County Council at that time.

They each provide unemployed jobseekers with advice and assistance to identify, pursue and secure employment.  In addition, local employment services provide activation supports to six other target groups most distant from the labour market including refugees, people with disabilities and Travellers.<\/p> <p>Prior to the introduction of Intreo and JobPath, my Department had approximately 300 case officers, which included LES contracted staff, to  serve over 460,000 people on the live register.  That was equivalent to a case load of over 1,500 jobseekers per case officer as against  international benchmarks for best practice in the delivery of such  services of less than 200 per case officer.<\/p> <p>In developing the Intreo service and introducing JobPath, the total  number of case officers has increased to approximately 1,200.

These jobseekers are typically long-term unemployed and are dealt with either by the local  employment service or by JobPath.  In line with international norms, my Department is seeking to maintain the case load for this cohort at no  more than 125 per case officer.<\/p> <p>In order to achieve this level of case officer support, my Department has reduced the number of people referred to local employment services but has asked the providers to increase the time they allocate to work  with each individual jobseeker to provide a more enhanced and higher quality service.  This should result in reduced pressure on the service and also an improved level of service for jobseekers, which focuses on quality outcomes.<\/p> <p>A customer may be referred to the LES where, following a 12 month engagement with Intreo or JobPath, they are not pursuing an education or training  programme or have not secured sustainable employment.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, for taking the time on 21 February to meet with the residents in Portrane, an area where I was a GP for many years.  Councillor Tom O'Leary, who represented me on the day, was very impressed with the practical advice offered by the Minister of State and his stated commitment on camera to fund works at this location under the minor works programme.  I understand applications of up to &euro;500,000 can be considered.  However, this issue has been ongoing for too long.  The local residents are extremely worried, frustrated and angry that no action has been taken to deal with their plight, namely, the real risk to their homes from flooding by the nearby sea.  The residents have been responding proactively to try to defend their homes from the sea and feel abandoned by the authorities.  They installed many temporary one tonne sandbags in order to protect the boardwalk, which has now washed away.<\/p> <p>When I was a Deputy and Minister for Health I met with residents and the then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Brian Hayes.  Following on from the meeting an allocation of &euro;200,000 was approved for The Burrow in Portrane under a national plan to deal with flood risk and damage.  Nothing practical or real has happened since then.  Reports have been written but real action to deal with the serious threats seems to be at a stalemate.  I regret to say the only wall that cannot seem to be breached at The Burrow in Portrane is the wall of red tape stopping local residents from getting fair treatment and works to protect their homes.<\/p> <p>The local residents' committee hears of flood defence works being approved at other locations and cannot understand why The Burrow in Portrane cannot get similar funding and works carried out to deal with the threat to their homes from the sea.  Ray Brett, who the Minister of State met recently on his visit to The Burrow, explained to him that &euro;1 million was approved and spent in Lahinch on a similar sensitive habitat area and is asking that such a scheme would be considered for The Burrow in Portrane.  The installation of a membrane dug down 6 m and backfilled to protect the toe and sand dunes seems an environmentally practical solution, which was approved and has been proven in Lahinch.<\/p> <p>In 2015 Fingal County Council advised a local Portrane family to evacuate their home.  I am sure the Minister of State would acknowledge that is a very serious matter.  I ask him, in a positive manner, to try to progress a solution.  I know the Minister of State wants to do that.  The issue requires a permanent solution.  Has Fingal County Council contacted him or the Department since his visit to The Burrow in Portrane on 21 February, two weeks ago?  In order to bring some sort of finality or deadline to the issue could I suggest or encourage the Minister of State to write to the council CEO, Paul Reid, and ask Fingal County Council to produce a plan for consideration by his officials within four weeks.  I suggest that in one week or two weeks following that, the Department would facilitate a round-table meeting with officials from the OPW, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service, Fingal County Council and three members of the Fingal coastal erosion committee in order to agree an acceptable plan that could be considered for approval by the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW.<\/p> <p>If action is not taken homes will be flooded and under threat, roads will be flooded and the natural habitat and dunes we all want to protect will be gone.  It is time to knock heads together, which I know the Minister of State wants to do.  As a practical man who has dealt with such issues as a public representative, I hope he will agree to setting up this process and arrive at a solution, which I am told he is anxious to fund.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Can I plead that the residents not be subjected to another winter of inaction and uncertainty in regard to the safety of their homes? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#E00300","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Reilly for raising this important issue.  I am familiar with the case.  As the Senator said, I visited Burrow Beach and Portrane on 21 February to view at first hand the impact that coastal erosion is having on the area.  As I stated at the time, my office has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline, as part of the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study, ICPSS.  This information has been published and is available to all local authorities.<\/p> <p>The study enables local authorities to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties, including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works of a structural and non-structural nature.  My office supports and assists intervention management options which are economically justified on cost-benefit grounds and are environmentally sound. <\/p> <p>Fingal County Council is working hard to identify viable solutions to the erosion problem at Portrane and I look forward to receiving proposals from the council in due course.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, operates the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria, including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.<\/p> <p>Fingal County Council applied for and was approved funding of &euro;57,800 under this scheme in 2012 to carry out a coastal erosion risk management study of Portrane to Rush which included Burrow Beach.  The funding was drawn down in 2013 following completion of the study.  Following the severe storms of winter 2013-14, funding of  &euro;200,000 was provided by the OPW to Fingal County Council under the Government decision on repair works to damaged coastal protection infrastructure which included projects at Burrow Beach.  <\/p> <p>Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process which takes place around the entire coastline.  Coastal erosion may threaten human life, infrastructure such as roads and may undermine and cause damage to properties.  However, it should be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects on the local environment, such as providing natural nourishment and a supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.  <\/p> <p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by local authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are  economically justified on cost-benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources. <\/p> <p>Local authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources.  If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.  As intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options.  The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the minor works scheme are available.  I assure the Senator that the OPW will continue to work with Fingal County Council to address coastal erosion issues in the county over coming years, having regard to availability of resources and in the context of the framework for State investment in this area that I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#F00200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Up to 1.2 million people across Dublin depend on the Dublin Fire Brigade emergency medical services.  Dubliners proudly support Dublin Fire Brigade.  This is evident from the rally that took place last night outside City Hall, Dublin.  Those at the rally were supported by each grouping on the council, including the group of the Minister's party, Fine Gael.<\/p> <p>In fact, Dubliners have proudly supported Dublin Fire Brigade since its inception.  It is the oldest uniformed organisation in the country.  In 1705, for the first time, four mechanical units were given to fight fire in the city.  In 1898, what we know today as the Dublin fire rescue and emergency ambulance service was established in Winetavern Street in the Liberties in Dublin 8.  It has continued unbroken service to the people of Dublin since then.<\/p> <p>Senior management at Dublin City Council, led by the chief executive, Mr. Owen Keegan, have decided to change this.  They have decided to fix what is not broken.  They are going to break it up and they want to remove the ambulance call and dispatch function.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th?  Why would this be the case?  Why disrupt an incredible, efficient and necessary service?<\/p> <p>Members of the fire brigade are present today.  The rest of them are out fighting and saving lives.  They are first responders.  They have come because they are so incensed by what is going on and how they are being treated, especially by Dublin City Council.  They are highly-trained paramedics.  They use emergency vehicles and operate a highly-efficient and dedicated call and dispatch centre that consolidates all fire and emergency calls.  The linkage of the call and dispatch centre with paramedics and emergency vehicles means that both ambulances and fire and rescue vehicles can be sent simultaneously to situations where they are required.  We have car crashes daily from early morning to late at night.  The current set-up means that fire operations can also act as emergency cover if the ambulance is not available.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maire Devine:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When we make or receive 999 calls as nurses, the fire brigade comes to the rescue of people in need 90% of the time.  Dublin Fire Brigade provides a world-class service and has the second fastest response time in Europe.  Its gold standard model has been adopted in Berlin, Tokyo and Paris.  The fire service in London sent staff to Dublin to conduct research on this model and is about to implement the same service.  Lo and behold, on a whim, the CEO of Dublin City Council, Mr. Owen Keegan, using a reserved function has decided to take this away.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will refer to the HIQA report and its findings regarding the improvement in ambulance response times throughout the city and county, but he must recognise that the expert report dealt adequately with all of the queries, difficulties, scenarios and nuances with which HIQA came up and that there is no need for HIQA to implement its report.  That could be recognised by HIQA, but it certainly needs to be recognised by the Minister of State and the senior Minister.  It is imperative that this service be retained.  I ask the Minister to address the dispute and avert the final option of two days of strike action.  The industrial action would spread nationwide.  First responders are respected, as are all 24-hour emergency service staff, including nurses, doctors and garda&iacute;.  They are the essential fabric of this society and Dubliners are proud to support the fire officers who will be supported by every last man, woman and child in the city if they choose to take industrial action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#G00500","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I welcome the fire service staff who are present and commend them for their work.<\/p> <p>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister of Health who offers his apologies, to provide an update for the House on the current discussions about ambulance services in Dublin.  The HIQA report on ambulance services which was published in December 2014 highlighted significant public safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  The report identified concerns about the existence of two separate control and dispatch processes and also highlighted the need for greater clinical governance of both services.  It pointed clearly to the need for enhanced integration of service provision in the greater Dublin area.<\/p> <p>The capacity review published last year examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  It identified deficits in ambulance capacity, including in the Dublin area.  It also identified the requirement for the migration of all call taking and the dispatch of ambulances in Dublin to the National Emergency Operations Centre to ensure a safer and more responsive service.  We all agree that we want such a service.  Implementation of the recommendations made in the capacity review requires a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  To this end, increased funding has been made available for ambulance services in the HSE national service plan 2017.  New resources will go into the services this year.<\/p> <p>The  Dublin ambulance services review which was jointly commissioned by the HSE and Dublin City Council is focused on identifying a service model for the optimal provision of emergency ambulance services and patient care in the Dublin region, including service quality, patient safety, capacity and value for money.  Late last week a copy of the final review, as well as a joint HSE and Dublin City Council implementation plan, was submitted to the Department's Secretary General.  The report and implementation plan are under consideration.  Departmental officials are engaging with their counterparts in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on the report and implementation plan, with a view to agreeing a position on the appropriate way forward prior to the submission of the report and a proposed approach to their respective Ministers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> With regard to the expert panel referred to by the Senator, my information is that following publication of the HIQA report in 2014, Dublin City Council established a trade union consultative forum to work towards securing agreement on a model of operation to address the recommendations made in the report.

It is understood the expert panel proposed a technical solution to link the Dublin Fire Brigade call centre with the National Emergency Operations Centre.  The Department of Health has been advised that the various options for call taking and dispatch were examined by the Health Service Executive and Dublin City Council in the context of preparation of the implementation plan.<\/p><p>I am disappointed at media reports this morning that strike notice has been served on Dublin City Council.

Every time we talk about an incident of residential abuse or children in care we have another inquiry and saga and nobody ever seems to be held accountable.  It is extraordinary.  It has been a very bad and distressing week for many people who grew up in Tuam with the heartbreak of mothers and their children.

An inquiry is being held into these shocking events.  All of the people who have been impacted on by their dealings with mother and baby homes and other institutions such as the Magdalen laundries need to be listened to.  The Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors state approximately 35,000 women and girls went to nine mother and baby homes between 1904 and 1996 and that their treatment needs to be investigated.  There should not be a hierarchy of women who suffered.  All women who passed through the homes and want their stories told must be listened to.  We must ensure the ill-treatment is brought to light and will never be allowed to happen again.  In a survey of 5,500 people conducted by <i>The Journal<\/i>87% felt the mother and baby home inquiry should be expanded.

I hope the terms of reference of the commission of investigation will be widened to include the other 46 service users who spent time in the foster home in question.  How many similar cases are there?  Are there other cases where the HSE, Tusla or the Garda were made aware of sexual or physical abuse allegations against a foster parent and the child was not removed from the foster home?

According to Justice for Magdalenes, there may have been as many as 180 institutions across Ireland which had in their care women who were pregnant and their babies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We need to examine ourselves to see the attitudes that prevailed in Irish society right up to the 1990s, when these institutions remained open.  I mention not only these institutions but also the Magdalen laundries and the industrial schools in which children suffered such abuse over so many decades.  We need to question the terrible repressive attitude towards sexuality, towards women and towards children and the deep and silent suffering experienced for so long by so many women and children and their families.<\/p><p>We need to acknowledge the fact that so many men were responsible for this.  An enormous silence surrounds that.  For every one of those babies and infants, because some were as old as three, who was found, there was not only a mother but also a father and, indeed, siblings, and we have to think of all that.  <\/p><p>We have to think about what is still going on today where we are exporting thousands of women to England every year because we cannot face up to the reality of crisis pregnancy and of women's reproductive health needs.  That remains the case today and it is shameful that we are still dealing with that issue in such a repressive and oppressive manner and are still oppressing women and refusing to countenance, confront or acknowledge the reality of life in Ireland and of crisis pregnancy.<\/p><p>I thank the Leader for arranging a debate on this matter on Thursday.  I hope he will be able to tell us in advance of that debate that the terms of reference of the commission have been expanded.  We will also discuss the Grace inquiry, another instance where a child was very badly failed by the State.  We need to debate the wider issues and the wider context and, as others have said, the role of religious institutions and of religious orders, such as the Bon Secours Order, which is currently before the courts in regard to Tuam where it is facing some serious questioning.  We need to have a broader debate.<\/p><p>On a lighter note, I wish everyone a happy International Women's Day tomorrow.  There will be a series of events.  We look forward to the series of events in the Oireachtas next year that will commemorate and celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the right to vote in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#P00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1488897000,"counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#Q00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, and in the context of International Women's Day, I wish to announce formally for the information of the House that, on my recommendation as Cathaoirleach, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission today appointed Ms Bridget Doody as Clerk Assistant of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959, as amended.

I do not intend to rehearse the horror of what happened to those babies and their mothers but I share in the disgust that everyone in the House, and outside it, feels today.  It is important we take this opportunity to commend Ms Catherine Corless, as others have done, and also the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes for bringing these issues to light, even though the process has been very difficult at times.  I also compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, for the prompt, open and respectful manner in which she addressed the issue.  Unfortunately, this frankness and respect was not mirrored last week by the response or, indeed, the lack of response from the Bon Secours Order which ran the home at the time.  It is not as if it was blind-sided by the unexpected news.  It had a considerable amount of time to prepare a response for this but the decision not to comment on the findings has to have been a conscious one on its part.  The motto of the Bon Secours Order is: Good Help to Those in Need.  Many of those who spent time in these homes were in need but I do not believe they ever got good help.  Whatever the circumstances, the children whose lives were very short and ended in Tuam did not get the respect of a proper burial.  The lack of response from the Bon Secours Order further compounds this indignity and is both mean-spirited and un-Christian.  I do not believe this approach is reflective of the values of the majority of the serving sisters, if any, and I call on the Bon Secours Order to provide a truly caring response by giving a full apology as soon as possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Leader to urge the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to use whatever powers and resources are at her disposal to ensure that these children are given the dignity of a respectful burial and that their memory is marked in an appropriate way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#Q00300","speaker":"1375","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the announcement about the appointment of Ms Bridget Doody as Clerk-Assistant of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

The LNG project will provide a significant guarantee for energy security in the country once it gets the go-ahead, and will be a huge boost for the entire mid-west region, particularly counties Kerry and Limerick.  I welcome the announcement in yesterday's paper, <i>The Independent<\/i>, that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has selected two particular projects to support to secure our energy needs in the post-Brexit scenario.  One of those is the LNG project.  This is most welcome news, particularly since the Minister has indicated that he hopes to tap into the strategic investment fund to boost these projects.  It shows that we in the Seanad can be instrumental in highlighting important issues in a non-partisan and non-political way.  This has been brought up as a political football for many years.  It is only since it has been raised here in the Seanad that it has been given a cool and reasonable appraisal.

I wonder how many are hanging their heads in shame today.<\/p> <p>There are also thousands of mothers who gave up their children or were forced to do so.  Some believed that they were adopted.

Can we even stop to think about the pain those women are going through today as they wonder whether they had a child buried in Tuam or sent somewhere else for adoption?  There is not a Member of this House, any other House, or any establishment in this country that has not been touched by this dirty little secret.<\/p> <p>It was a dirty little secret.

In the period from January 2016 to January 2017 there was a 74% increase in the number of applications for passports.  Some 60,000 applications are pending.  As is well known, the increase stems from Brexit in that people with an entitlement to an Irish passport are applying for one, particularly in Northern Ireland, Britain and the United States.  Without a doubt, staff in the Passport Office are under a lot of pressure.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has appointed additional staff, but I raise a particular issue concerning the Passport Express system.  There was a ten working day turnaround period from the time an application was made through the post office, but this has increased to 15 days.  The reality is, however, that it is taking a lot longer than 15 days to process applications.  People pay the &euro;80 fee and send off their application using the Passport Express system, thinking they will receive a new passport in 15 days, but they will not.  When they monitor their application on-line, they see that nothing is happening and that the date of receipt might be beyond their travel departure date.  There is an obvious issue about resources in the Passport Office, but, apart from this, it should be made clear that the turnaround time is not within 15 days.  As a result, applicants should apply much earlier.  When members of the public are handing over their money in the post office, there should be a sign notifying them of possible delays.  The extended turnaround time is causing chaos for people in making travel plans.  They are turning to politicians for help, but the problem could be alleviated if the position was set out more clearly.  The Minister should examine the matter.  The severe delays in the Passport Office should be communicated more clearly to the general public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#S00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>We had a strange day in Limerick yesterday when 25 beds in St. John's Hospital were summarily closed owing to budget constraints.

The Minister had a licence issued in regard to one family in west Cork for the use of cannabis for a young child.  That application was supported by the medical consultant.  A second application was received on 31 January but it did not have the support of the consultant who was caring for that child.<\/p> <p>It is important that we have checks and balances in this matter also.

She went on to state, \"Patients treated with cannabis should be under the care of a medical consultant who has expertise and experience in the treatment of the specified condition, and who is responsible for the monitoring and follow-up of the patient\".<\/p> <p>The Minister is prepared to give a licence where that is available.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that we stop making false commitments to people to the effect that a licence can be issued and there will be no monitoring.

That is shocking and people want to get to the bottom of it, but what is also shocking is the current foster care system whereby 5,000 children are awaiting assessment.  At the same time as people are looking at what happened in Tuam and feel helpless and hopeless, there are children who need fostering.  That is what citizens can do now to help.  The situation concerning Grace is a modern day case similar to what happened in Tuam.  Now it is individual cases instead of hundreds but there are hundreds of young people similar to Grace, children who need our help.<\/p> <p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins mentioned Marie Collins.  She is another example of how institutions do not want to reform, do not want change and do not want people to be brought to account.

The man who first flew the flag, Thomas Francis Meagher, had an extraordinary life.  Not only did he participate in a rebellion in Ireland in 1848, but he was the last man sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered here.  Prior to sentencing the judge asked him if he had anything to say, to which he replied: \"Well your honour, if you do not sentence me to death, I will try again.\"  The judge obliged and sentenced him to death but it was commuted to transportation for life to Australia and he ended up in the 69th regiment of the Union Army in the American Civil War and became governor of Montana.  For the historical record of the House, the flag that is flying today over Leinster House was first flown from 33 The Mall in Waterford.  The Ceann Comhairle presented it to the Defence Forces and they undertook that today would be the first day they would fly it from Leinster House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#U00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>To clarify, is the Senator formerly moving an amendment that motion No. 19 be taken today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#U00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Yes.

I am seeking a review of the Irish credit rating system because it is one that offers no forgiveness.  In other countries people are given a second chance, but that is not the case in this country.  Credit unions operate under strict rules imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The social protection scheme which is operated by credit unions and which was designed for people on low incomes has not been availed of by all credit unions.  What about the squeezed middle who renegotiated their loans and are paying their way?  They have had a tough five or six years, but after renegotiating their loans and paying their way, there is a black mark against them.  It is very difficult for such persons to get even the smallest of loans from credit unions or banks.  We need a new system in order that they can take out small or medium-sized loans which they will pay back.  Retail sales at Christmas were down significantly because, whether we like it, the retail sector runs on credit and if we are to get the economy running, we have to help people to get credit.  If they want to take out a small or medium-sized loan, they should be given a second chance.  If they have renegotiated their loans, why put a black mark against them?  They are paying their way.  In many cases, their downfall was the result of circumstances connected to the crash which brought them to a position where they had to renegotiate their loans.  We have to move on.  Many people in middle Ireland are going to loan sharks who are charging interest rates of 200% or 300%, something we want to stop.  We need a debate on the Irish Credit Bureau which is past its sell-by date.  We need to examine how we can help the people concerned.

Where was the State?  Where was society?  Some of us in society at that time condoned this through our silence and inaction.  There comes a time when we must stand up and I praise all those men and women who did.  I know some of the women and their children who were in Bessborough.  Senator Devine is right that many of our fellow citizens are suffering from mental health issues because they were so callously treated by our society and our State.  There is a duty of care on all of us, no matter who we are or what our political hue is, to look after and treat these people properly and with dignity and respect.  Every day, these people seek justice and truth.  In many cases, they lament the way they were treated; that they were forced to give up their children against their will and were told they must do that or go across the pond to England.  That is no way for a society to function or for a State to act.<\/p><p>I hope that through the children's referendum, the referendum on divorce, the referendum on marriage equality and the Child and Family Relationships Act we can put things right in terms of how our State governs and legislates for people.  We must ensure that the commission of investigation gets up and running, gets answers and seeks the truth so we can put in place a structure for the women and children who have been let down by our State.  Our society was very quick to judge.  It was very harsh in its sentencing of many women.  That is the legacy we must not obscure or airbrush.  We must make sure we never forget so that the next generation is treated with respect and dignity.<\/p><p>As the Cathaoirleach said, we will have debates on these matters in the House this week.

Some of the changes are because of the importance of the issues raised on the Order of Business today and because some Members will be missing for the statements on defence on Thursday and I wanted to ensure those who requested the debate would be present.  I agree 100% with Senator Devine when she says that those who have to pay, must pay, irrespective of who they are.  The resignation of Marie Collins sends an awful signal to me.  This is a woman of integrity, a woman of decency and a woman who inspires many of us.  If she is speaking about obstruction of justice or about not being able to get to the truth, that sends a wrong message to me.<\/p><p>I hope we will be able to have an honest debate and that Members of this House will be able to contribute to terms of reference for the commission of investigation, which is important.  It is clear that there is a yearning in society for truth and for justice.  I hope we can achieve that for children, parents and women.<\/p><p>I hope we can send a signal to the fathers of children that they also have a responsibility and duty of care.

We will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the issue in respect of the number of days and the delays in terms of Passport Express. <\/p><p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of St. John's Hospital.  It is important to understand the role of the Bon Secours group today.  We cannot associate the Bon Secours hospital group today with the events of the past.  Many very fine people are working in those hospitals and they provide a very important resource in our health care system.  It is, to be fair, a bit disingenuous to associate the Minister for Health with that.  The issue the Senator raised would be far better served by not being intertwined with the issue he has referenced.  My understanding is that the Minister for Health was opening a new facility there yesterday.  We should all welcome any facility being opened in our health care system.  It is a different matter whether we have a one tier system or a private-public system.  I will have that debate with the Senator again.  <\/p><p>On the issue in terms of the beds, I have been told that some of them have just been closed temporarily and that extra funding is being sought and is being negotiated with the HSE.  Again, any closure of beds for whatever reason is unacceptable.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House but perhaps the Senator might table a Commencement matter.  It is a matter of importance to have beds open and not closed. <\/p><p>The issue raised by Senator Colm Burke in respect of cannabis medical treatment is in the news today because of the walk of Vera Twomey on behalf of her daughter, Ava.  All of us who have any decency and compassion want to see this family get access to treatment and to have their daughter looked after in a compassionate and prompt way.  There is a lot of misinformation about this issue.  The Minister, as Senator Burke said, cannot issue the licence.  This is about ensuring that there is expertise and monitoring and that we can get access to treatment for this child, and in general.  As Senator Burke rightly said, the HPRA report, which is out today but which I have not yet seen, makes a recommendation.  The Chief Medical Officer last night issued a very important, comprehensive statement in respect of the process that is under way to establish an access programme for cannabis based treatments, the first of its kind in Ireland.  He also, in his statement, refers to the period for which this access programme is being established and states that is open to the Minister to provide a licence for access to cannabis for medical purposes in individual cases.  It is also about being endorsed by a consultant, who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  In his press statement the Chief Medical Officer says it is crucial that the granting of any such licence takes due care and consideration of the potential unintended consequences associated.  It is also important to recognise the independence and importance of the patient-doctor relationship.  <\/p><p>The important point is that there is a process under way.  We all want to see, in the case of Vera Twomey and her daughter, Ava, treatment being given and the child's life and quality of life being improved.  I hope we can all work to achieve that. <\/p><p>I am happy to take Senator Daly's amendment.  As I said to him before today, I was happy to have him place this issue on the Order Paper.  Perhaps it could be a project of the Seanad.  The booklet on the national flag is very important and we should look at it in terms of how we can not just fly our flag, but care for and respect it.  Looking at some of the imagery on television, at soccer, rugby or GAA events, at election counts or wherever, the way we respect our flag should be noted.  I would draw all Members' attention to section 13 regarding respect for our national flag and how we use and fly it.  I commend Senator Daly for his initiative and I would be happy to take the amendment today.<\/p><p>Senator Norris referred to President Trump and raised the issue of fake news.  Senator Butler last week got a lot of traction on his commentary here in regard to fake news and alternative facts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important, in any political debate, that we do not reach the line of populism and try to curry favour with whomever.

I agree with him that we must examine the system.  In my opinion it is not fit for purpose as presently constituted.

These principles are enshrined in Article 12 of EU Directive 97\/67\/EC, as amended by EU Directive 2008\/6\/EC, and provide that the tariffs must be,<i>inter alia<\/i>, affordable and cost orientated.  These directives are transposed into Irish law by the 2011 Act.<\/p><p>Article 12 of the directive provides that member states will ensure that the tariffs for each of the services forming part of the universal service comply with the tariff principles.  The requirements are clearly intended to apply only to the universal postal service, and it was on this basis that the Act was drafted.  It appears that the intent of the proposed amendment to section 28(1) of the Act is to widen the scope of the tariff principles beyond the universal postal service.  Such action would represent a significant change in policy and require detailed consideration and analysis as well as consultation with stakeholders.<\/p><p>I advise the House that an identical amendment was tabled on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  It was argued that the extension of regulatory measures in this manner and without detailed consideration of its impacts was not appropriate.  On that basis, the amendment was withdrawn.  The position remains unchanged.<\/p><p>Regulatory measures are generally introduced to address issues arising in a particular market and should be introduced where necessary and only in line with the principle of proportionality.  There has been no signal from the market of the need for regulatory measures in terms of tariffs outside the universal postal service.  Indeed, the level of competition in the packets and parcels market has already been highlighted by ComReg.  In addition, real competition in the form of alternative delivery solutions can be observed in the significant decline in mail experienced by An Post as a result of e-substitution where some large customers are moving to electronic alternatives.<\/p><p>The main non-universal service obligation services are parcels, publicity post, PostAim and Express Post.  There is competition in these areas from private operators such as DHL, FedEx, Nightline, Fastway, CityPOST, Lettershop and the Leaflet Company, to name a few.<\/p><p>For the reasons outlined, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Senators Boyhan and McDowell to section 28(1) of the 2011 Act.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Denis Naughten:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Turning to the amendments proposed by the Senator to section 28(5) of the 2011 Act, I must first address the inclusion of the term \"may fail\".  While I understand the wish to see the powers of the regulator strengthened, widening the scope of the powers to include a determination the universal service provider may fail is too subjective.  It is difficult to see how ComReg should judge that a universal service provider may fail in its obligations to comply with the tariff principles.  In considering this amendment I consulted ComReg, which agrees with this assessment.  I understand and am cognisant of the impact this measure might have on consumers and the SME sector.  In this regard I have issued a policy direction to An Post instructing that the price increases introduced following the repeal of the price cap mechanism must be subject to prior consultation with ComReg and have due regard to the tariff principles set out in section 28 of the 2011 Act, as well as the interests of personal users of postal services and SMEs.  I have reiterated this in person to the chair and chief executive of An Post.<\/p><p>With regard to the substitution of the word \"shall\" for \"may\" I do not believe it is appropriate to make obligatory the issuing of a direction.  A direction referred to in section 28(5) is an enforcement mechanism which may be used by ComReg, and detailed procedures around the issuing of such directions are provided for in section 51 of the 2011 Act.  There may be some instances under section 28(5) where a formal direction of this nature may not be appropriate or necessary and, therefore, it is important that ComReg retains the discretion provided for at present.  For the reasons I have outlined I am unable to accept the amendments as they have been proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#CC00800","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488897000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to give the rationale behind the Government's decision to walk away from the question of the pricing of stamps, which is the basic issue.  Will the price of a stamp increase from 72 cent to 92 cent or &euro;1?  I was at the Department a long time ago and something we would never give away was the authority of the ministerial office to decide this because it is a law of diminishing returns.  The more it increases the less is received.  The more competitive it is made the better it is.  There are other options, such as an increase for express post.<\/p> <p>I do not particularly like Ministers giving away power.  I am dealing with Coillte at present, which is not under the control of anybody.  It is a commercial semi-State body and it can do what it likes.  My colleague discussed Bord na M&oacute;na earlier today.  The commercial semi-State bodies have a loose hand in dealing with the public, and the Minister knows what is going on in our area because he was at the meeting.  This is an example of the removal of ministerial power from semi-State bodies.  They can walk into our area and try to destroy it with wind turbines and they do not care a damn.  They do not care about the Minister or me and they do not care about the public.  They are only interested in getting maximum subsidy through their work.<\/p> <p>I will not second the amendment because I have not dealt with it and I do not know what its implications would be.  I accept the Minister's response.  I was away in London last week dealing with Brexit issues when this matter came up.  On principle, there should be control over the cost of stamps.  The Minister knows when the price of stamps increase the number of people who use them decreases.  It is the law of diminishing returns.  What is the Minister's rationale for this decision?<\/p> <p>It is proposed to close 80 post offices and there is a lack of business in post offices.  When the price of stamps increases the post offices' cut decreases because they rely on a percentage of sales to keep them in business.  This is a very concerning time.  I cannot understand why sub-post offices are not the responsibility of the Minister.  Why are they under the aegis of the Department with responsibility for rural development?  When I was at the Department, all post offices were the responsibility of the Minister at the time and we ran the whole show.  We ran it without An Post and we made money, but that is another day's work.

We are fighting over minor issues such as the universal social obligation that applies to parcel delivery and express post.  These are areas where the market is highly competitive.  It is logical to change the legislation regarding this matter. <\/p> <p>I request that the amendment be withdrawn.  This would send out a signal that Members of the Oireachtas are putting their shoulders to the wheel on this important issue.  We need to firm up An Post and the Chamber must send out the right vibe because An Post faces serious issues.  I am greatly concerned about the organisation and wish the Minister the best of luck in this matter.  In some senses, we should save the debate for the bigger issues coming down the line because they will present significant challenges to everyone in the Chamber.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030700002#EE00700","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488897000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
