There are a number of models for using land for greenways only one of which is CPO.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the various models used to deliver individual projects, it is a matter for the County Council in charge of delivering a specific project to consider access to land on a case by case basis and take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  In the event of a proposed route traversing private land there are a number of options that can be considered by the authority, the first being the permissive access model.  This is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level.  It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners.\u00a0 Indeed, the most well-known Greenway in the country, the Great Western Greenway from Westport to Achill, has been built using the permissive access model.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided on.  There is no one size fits all approach to this.<\/p>  <p>  As stated above, negotiated permissive access from the perspectives of cost and public ownership has value but, for projects of national scale, such as the Dublin to Galway greenway, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land and involve major state investment, it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07300"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[9472\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide details of all properties rented by his Department; the annual cost of the leases; the duration of the leases; and the capacity, and occupancy, of each premises, as at the end of January 2015.","asker":"1058","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>The properties occupied by my Department, including the bodies under its aegis, are provided by the Office of Public Works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Data","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA08200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[10165\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA08300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the current rate of unemployment in County Clare; the rate of unemployment in County Clare, over the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.

Information providers support their clients to act on their own behalf wherever possible (self-advocacy). They also advocate directly on behalf of their clients through contacting and negotiating with third parties or attending meetings, hearings or appeals.<\/p><p>In 2014, the nationwide network of CISs was allocated funding of some &euro;12.5 million from CIB&rsquo;s overall budget allocation of &euro;46 million.

Funding of &euro;3.07 million was made available to NAS in 2014 from the CIB.<\/p><p>During 2014, NAS provided an advocacy service to some 1,012 people.  This number includes over 340 new cases.  Overall, 28% of advocacy cases related to housing issues, 19% related to health issues, 13% related to social welfare and 11% to justice issues, while a further 7% related to court cases regarding children.

For many lone parents, most of whom are women, this has meant long-term social welfare dependency, associated poverty and social exclusion for them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely. These reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to access the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment programmes, to develop their skills set and, ultimately, to secure employment and financial independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[9892\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding mortgage interest rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>At the outset, I must confirm to the Deputy that\u00a0the lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a shareholding -\u00a0are independent commercial entities.\u00a0I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or\u00a0in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.\u00a0 It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. \u00a0The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty\u00a0or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated in\u00a0previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated\u00a0that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Patrick Honohan in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0last November\u00a0stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.

I am retaining the child ceiling of &euro;500 for those aged 18 to 20 that are continuing to avail of insurance at the child premium rates.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have agreed to operate the changes on an administrative basis pending the provision of the underpinning legislation as part of the next Finance Bill. Therefore, the changes will be effective for all policies purchased or renewed (or which come into effect) on or after 1 May 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The current regime for\u00a0tax relief on medical insurance premiums\u00a0provides a maximum tax relief\u00a0ceiling\u00a0of &euro;500 in respect of\u00a0a child, which is defined as an individual under the age of 18 years or, if over 18 years of age and under\u00a023 years of age, who is receiving full-time education and in respect of whom a child premium is paid.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is not compulsory for insurers to offer child premium rates to young adults under the current system and it will not be compulsory for them to offer reduced premiums under the new system.  Therefore, where a full adult premium is payable, the full adult ceiling for tax relief of &euro;1,000 has always been available and this will continue to be the case.  It should be further noted that the maximum tax relief is available at the rate of 20% of the premium payable or &euro;200, whichever is lower.  Thus, where a reduced premium is being availed of, the full adult ceiling for relief may not be employed depending on the premium price.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners\u00a0tentatively estimate that the cost of extending the full &euro;1,000 adult ceiling for private medical insurance tax relief to all persons aged 21 or over, would be\u00a0approximately &euro;1 million. <\/p>  <p>  This provisional estimate is based on returns to Revenue for the year 2013 (the most recent year for which data is available) and does not take account of any changes in the level of medical insurance coverage or premium rates in the interim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Collection","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[10133\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding local property tax in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a key aspect of the work undertaken in regard to Local Property Tax (LPT) was the development of a comprehensive property register of residential properties in the State.

This is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse.  Any delay in the collection of tax that is properly due adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue assures me that its strong preference is to work with viable businesses or taxpayers suffering temporary cashflow difficulties to agree a mutually acceptable solution rather than deploying debt collection\/enforcement options.  Revenues commitment in this regard is clearly evidenced by the fact that it granted almost 9,000 phased payment arrangements in respect of over &euro;120m of debt during 2014 rather than using debt collection\/enforcement action to secure the liabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  Where debt collection\/enforcement action becomes necessary to secure an outstanding debt, the Revenue caseworker firstly writes to the defaulting business or taxpayer demanding that the liability be paid within a specified timeframe, which is normally seven days.  The  final demand letter also clearly warns that the consequence of continued non-compliance is referral of the debt to enforcement.  Revenues first line debt collection\/enforcement options for the majority of cases are Sheriff and Solicitor action and when a case is referred, responsibility for any future negotiation is delegated to the collection agent.  <\/p>  <p>  Once a case is referred for debt collection\/enforcement, the Sheriff or Solicitor writes to the taxpayer or business offering a final opportunity to agree a mutually acceptable solution.  Where no solution can be agreed, the Sheriff or Solicitor then seeks to collect the outstanding amounts, including costs, in accordance with the various legal powers available to them. <\/p>  <p>  Solicitor (Court) action is used to secure judgment against a defaulting business or taxpayer.  The judgment, which confirms the debt before the Courts, can be made public and can also be used by Revenue to place judgment mortgages against any property (owned by the business or taxpayer) to the value of the outstanding debt.  Judgments are also used as part of the proceedings associated with Bankruptcy, Forced Sale of property and committal to prison, though Revenue only applies such sanctions in the most egregious or intransigent cases. In all cases where judgment is sought, the business or taxpayer is notified by way of Court summons.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally in regard to notification of judgment mortgages, Revenue has confirmed to me that it is the responsibility of the Property Registration Authority to inform the business or taxpayer that such a charge has been put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Collection","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[10285\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding property tax in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the person to whom the Question refers paid his 2014 Local Property Tax (LPT) by Single Debit Authority (SDA) rather than by Direct Debit.<\/p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, the SDA option facilitates a single deduction from a current account (like an electronic cheque) and does not carry over from year to year in the way that Annual Debit Authorities, Direct Debits and Deductions at Source from salaries\/pensions do. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue also confirmed to me that a member of the LPT team has already made direct contact with the person and explained the various payment options to him.

This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs (or vested PRSAs).<\/p>  <p>  As regards the changes to AMRF access, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements (the so-called  ARF option), where an individual in a Defined Contribution pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum set aside amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with the &euro;63,500.<\/p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owners discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements).<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension nest-egg to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement.  Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation.  While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.<\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF.  This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.<\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years.  In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.<\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75.  This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a draw down of a lesser value than will now be permitted.  I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02950"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[10351\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 15 November 2011, in which he stated that at no point were Irish pounds being printed or was consideration being given to printing them, if that was in fact the case, in view of comments made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (details supplied); if he will provide, in detail, the contingency plans referred to by that Minister; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>My response to Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 15 November 2011 was accurate, at no point in 2011 (or since) were Irish pounds being printed.

Based on the details supplied by you, it would appear that the couple concerned have benefitted by approximately &euro;13 per week from the Budget tax measures. The Deputy will be aware that a cap of &euro;14 per week\u00a0was implemented as part of the Budget package to ensure that those with incomes in excess of &euro;70,000 did not benefit more than those with incomes at that level.  However, when\u00a0increases in the level\u00a0of Child Benefit introduced in the Budget\u00a0are taken into account, the couple concerned are benefitting by around &euro;15 per week. <\/p>  <p>  The Government\u00a0targeted its Budget package at the\u00a0\"squeezed middle\", i.e. those earning between &euro;32,000 and &euro;70,000 per annum.  While I am sympathetic to all those facing financial difficulties, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that over 87% of tax cases will have income of &euro;70,000 or less in 2015.  Therefore, it would be difficult to categorise households which have income in excess of &euro;70,000 as being in a \"middle income\" bracket. <\/p>  <p>  All married one-earner couples with sufficient income are benefitting from the increase in the standard rate band by &euro;1,000 from &euro;41,800 to &euro;42,800\u00a0in Budget 2015.  These couples also benefit from the cuts to the higher rate of income tax in the Budget, and from a reduction in USC if their income is under &euro;87,500.  The reason married one earners don't benefit as much from the income tax cuts, as a single individual or a married two-earner couple,\u00a0is because they\u00a0already pay much less income tax because of the transferable standard rate band.  For example, a married one earner on &euro;55,000 who has children will pay 55% less income tax than a single individual on the same income, in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The system of individualisation, which has been in the tax code since 1999,\u00a0is now integral to the tax system.  When first announced, the stated purpose of individualisation was essentially, to ease the burden on single persons (65% of the work force), to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  At the same time, a home carer allowance was introduced to compensate those who chose to stay at home to care for children rather than participate in the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system, with the standard rate band partially transferable between spouses, &euro;9,000 being the gap between the single and married one-earner bands.<\/p>  <p>  To complete or to reverse individualisation would cost in the region of &euro;800 million.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that no change be made to the current system. It concluded that the current system represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that that reversal of individualisation would see a second spouse entering the workforce, being liable to\u00a0the marginal rate of tax on the first euro of income.

A commercial practice may also be misleading if the trader omits or conceals information necessary for an informed consumer decision and if that omission or concealment would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.<\/p>  <p>  An advertiser who publishes an advertisement which contravenes the Act does not commit an offence, however, if the advertiser proves that he or she did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that its publication would be in contravention of the Act.  In order to assist enforcement of the Act&rsquo;s provisions on misleading advertising, an advertiser who accepts or agrees to publish an advertisement is required to make a record of the name and address of a trader who places an advertisement, and to keep that record for not less than two years from the date of its publication.<\/p>  <p>  Advertisements in print and other media that are directed at businesses are regulated by the European Communities (Misleading and Comparative Marketing Communications) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 774 of 2007) which give effect to Directive 2006\/114\/EC on Misleading and Comparative advertising.  The Regulations provide that a marketing communication is misleading if, in any way (including its presentation), it deceives or is likely to deceive in relation to any matter specified in the Regulations the trader to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches, and by reason of its deceptive nature, it is likely to affect the trader's economic behaviour or to injure or be likely to injure a competitor.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these legislative provisions, advertisements in print and other media come within the system of self-regulation established and administered by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.  The Authority&rsquo;s Code of Standards for Advertising, Promotional and Direct Marketing requires advertising and other marketing communications to be 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'.  Members of the Authority are required to abide by the Code and not to publish an advertisement that contravenes it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000068#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Competition and Consumer Protection Commission","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000068#WRG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[10387\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000068#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is satisfied with the operation of proposals, to end unfair practices in the retail sector to date; if he has studied the proposals by the European Union Commissioner for Agriculture to impose fines of up to 1% of retail turnover for unfair practices which impact upon producers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>I am aware of recent media coverage in which Commissioner Hogan was reported as having indicated his intention to bring forward proposals before the end of this year to address certain issues in the relationships between retailers and producers.

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.<\/p>  <p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe met the objectives to the greatest extent possible.

I especially noted the statement therein, to which the Deputy refers, that employment in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries dropped by 10,900 or 9.3% since Q4 2013. I would caution, however, that these figures should be viewed in the context of the following caveat provided by the CSO, the first paragraph of which is included in the release itself:<\/p>  <p>  After each Census of Population the sample of households for the QNHS is updated to ensure the sample remains representative.  The new sample based on the 2011 Census of Population was introduced incrementally from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013.  This change in sample can lead to some level of variability in estimates, particularly at more detailed levels and some caution is warranted in the interpretation of trends over the period of its introduction.  The first year on year comparisons for quarters based entirely on the new sample are therefore available as of Q4 2014.<\/p>  <p>  However, as the QNHS is a sample survey, there is a level of variance associated with the estimates produced from the QNHS. In the case of the Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector it can be noted that the CSO estimates that the standard error measure associated with employment in this sector was 4,800 in Q4 2014 and this should be borne in mind when considering the employment levels for this sector.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the estimate for Q4 2013 was particularly high, again likely due to sampling issues, which further skews this particular year-on-year comparison.<\/p>  <p>  We have been in regular contact with the CSO over recent years, and will continue to be so, in an effort to gain greater insight into the figures for employment in the sector.

Furthermore, in accordance with a Programme for Government commitment, my Department is continuing to progress a legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Irish Red Cross to further underpin the independence of the Society and I anticipate that this will result in a new Red Cross Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Departmental Official who is a member of the Irish Red Cross Executive Board regularly keeps the Minister informed of developments in the Society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equality Issues","counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":513,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[9933\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a company (details supplied) establishing a rule against the use of languages, other than English in its workplace, and making the non-use of the English language a disciplinary matter; and her further views that such policies have a negative impact on the participation of minority groups in the workplace.","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[9934\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a company (details supplied) establishing a rule against the use of languages, other than English, in its workplace, and making the non-use of the English language a disciplinary matter","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":515,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 302 together.<\/p><p>Equality legislation prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods and services on nine grounds, including race.

In social and cultural terms, the diverse nature of our migrant population, representing as it does people from approximately 200 different countries, exposes us to experiences of new communities coming from a wealth of diverse backgrounds and enriches our society and culture.  Indeed, increased linguistic competence in our society has a direct and positive impact on our foreign trade relations and accordingly on employment in Ireland.  Exposure to different languages helps us to develop a greater understanding of other cultures and the richness and diversity they can offer.  It also helps us as a nation, and as individuals, to appreciate and value in a deeper way those elements of Irish culture which help define us as a nation.  Ireland&rsquo;s changing demographic over the last 10 years has helped to shape a more socially and culturally diverse society and there is no doubt that Ireland will remain a diverse society into the future.  Accordingly, it important that we celebrate and harness this diversity and ensure that our communities, our businesses and our schools are inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1018"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation Provision","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[10160\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000072#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the closing of Saint Patrick's Institution; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to ending the practice of sending children to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.

I understand the gun company subsequently went into liquidation and the proof house at the Institute for Industrial Research Standards (IIRS) - the predecessor to the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) -  ceased to function at the same time. <\/p>  <p>  Firearms proofing is a safety matter with regard to the production and use of a firearm and is normally carried out at the point of manufacture.

Such a measure would only be viable if there was a domestic manufacturer of firearms.  <\/p>  <p>  Many firearms imported into Ireland come from the 14 countries which are members of the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'&eacute;preuve des armes &agrave; feu portatives (CIP).

Countries such as America and Canada are not members of CIP and their manufacturers test and proof mark their firearms according to their own standards.  Firearms from these non CIP countries are imported into Ireland.  Responsibility concerning product safety of firearms is a matter for manufacturers, the individual consumer and the firearms dealer who imports firearms.  Many EU countries, including Ireland, do not have domestic firearms production, and are not members of the CIP.  In the absence of sector specific EU legislation on the product safety of firearms, the  product and consumer safety issues relating to firearms fall under the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) 2001\/95\/EC of the European Commission.

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. At 22 February, 2015 there were 4,435 persons residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA.<\/p><p>The Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016 contains a number of commitments in the area of asylum. One of these commitments was to establish an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements to the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers. The terms of reference and Membership of the Working Group - chaired by retired Judge, Bryan McMahon - were announced in October 2014 and these can be found on the website of the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency - www.ria.gov.ie.  Membership of the Working group includes the Department of Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs, Tusla (the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency) and the Children's Rights Alliance. The Working Group is expected to present its report shortly.<\/p><p>A further commitment in the Statement of Government Priorities is to introduce an International Protection Bill to establish a single application procedure. Work on the Bill is ongoing in the Department and the expectation is that the Heads of the Bill will be submitted to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>In relation to child protection at direct provision centres, it should firstly be noted that parents who live in direct provision centres have the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of their children who reside with them.  The safety of all residents &ndash; especially children &ndash; is at the forefront of RIA&rsquo;s objectives. RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children.  RIA is compliant with all legislative requirements in this area. RIA has a fully staffed Child and Family Services Unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system.  The Unit also acts as a conduit between RIA and the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the latter having statutory responsibility in this area.<\/p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy is based on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' &ldquo;Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children&rdquo;.  This guidance document was developed to assist people in identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns.  The protection and welfare policy emphasises that the needs of children and families must be central to child care and child protection and welfare.  RIA's policy was reviewed and updated in 2014 and now contains a practice document to make it more user friendly. This document is published on RIA&rsquo;s website .<\/p><p>Each accommodation centre has a designated Child Protection Liaison Person who has undertaken Children First &ndash; Keeping Safe Training.  When a child protection or welfare incident arises in a RIA centre it is the function of that Liaison Person to contact the local Social Work Team to inform it of his or her concern and to liaise with the RIA Child and Family Services Unit.<\/p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy complements other policies and procedures in place, viz:<\/p><p>- Garda Vetting Policy. All staff in centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.<\/p><p>- Complaints Policy. Complaints by centre residents are dealt with in accordance with the procedures outlined in RIA's Accommodation Centre Services, Rules and Procedures (House Rules), a copy of which is provided to all residents and sets out, inter alia, the obligations placed both on the centre manager and the resident.<\/p><p>- RIA Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding RIA residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment.<\/p><p>- RIA Code of Practice for Persons Working in Accommodation Centres and RIA Staff.<\/p><p>- Policy on Accommodation of Aged Out Minors in RIA Accommodation Centres.<\/p><p>In relation to any allegations of persons engaging in prostitution or other criminal activities, anyone with information of this nature should report their evidence to the Garda&iacute; who are responsible for the investigation of criminal matters.

The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.<\/p><p>In relation to the introduction of payment of fines by instalment, a decision was taken to outsource all aspects of the recovery of fines to an external provider. The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices. There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.<\/p><p>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015. While it is desirable that the Act be commenced as soon as possible, it is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000073#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Registration Authority","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000073#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[10147\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000073#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a matter with regard to the Property Registration Authority in respect of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.

This unprecedented decision was taken with a view to getting an objective and independent legal view on whether further action might be warranted in any case.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, a panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  The independent review is well underway and 316 cases have been referred to the Panel. The volume and complexity of cases has led to the review taking somewhat longer than originally anticipated, but it is important that counsel take the time necessary to consider each case fully and carefully.  Counsel are making every effort to conclude their work as soon as is reasonably practicable.<\/p><p>The review in each case consists of an examination of the papers by independent counsel, who then make a recommendation as to whether any further action might be taken. [I know that some Deputies have argued that the review should have involved interviews with the complainants and other relevant persons, but with respect I think that is to misunderstand this process.] The purpose of the review is to triage the allegations to see if further investigations are needed. To have required counsel to hold hearings where they would interview everyone concerned would in effect have been to hold full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical. <\/p><p>The Panel is an independent body of counsel and the method of review is a matter for senior counsel who, in addition to examining individual complaints, are required to advise the Department generally on the management of the process, take a joint lead in allocating cases to junior counsel, and jointly oversee recommendations with a view to ensuring as far as possible a consistency of approach, except of course where a potential conflict of interest might arise. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that if there is any conflict, or potential conflict, the conflicted counsel not only will not be involved in the particular complaint, but also will not be aware of which counsel is reviewing it.\u00a0This is normal professional conduct and there are sufficient counsel on the Panel to ensure the practicality of this. \u00a0Whatever steps are necessary will be taken to ensure there is no conflict of interest.  <\/p><p>Counsel will not be making decisions, but rather making<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>recommendations, and the question of appeals does not therefore arise.The recommendation in each case is a matter for counsel.  Clearly, there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC, but any recommendation for referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.Where counsel do recommend further investigations, I will be very strongly guided by that advice.However, I would also make the point that in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken. This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.<\/p><p>Consideration is currently being finalised in relation to the format and content of replies to complainants, and the objective will be to ensure that each complainant receives as comprehensive an answer as possible.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000074#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000074#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[10312\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000074#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on commissioning an independent report concerning prostitution and trafficking here; the impact of the proposed legislation to criminalise the purchaser in the sex-trafficking industry; to make a comparison with other models in Sweden and elsewhere; the methods and resources An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be expected to use in investigating and detecting offenders; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>On 27 November, I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2014, which amongst other proposals, creates two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.  My primary concern, in introducing these provisions, is to vindicate the human rights of those trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Over 80% of women trafficked are the victims of sexual exploitation.<\/p><p>These proposals were developed following an extensive consultation process, initiated by my Department in 2012, including a Discussion Document which presented an objective analysis of the approaches adopted in other jurisdictions to address prostitution.  I would draw attention to a March 2014 Council of Europe Report entitled &quot;Prostitution, trafficking and modern slavery in Europe&quot;.  That Report reviews the approaches adopted in a number of countries and concludes that member states should consider &quot;criminalising the purchase of sexual services, based on the Swedish model, as the most effective tool for preventing and combating trafficking in human beings&quot;. In February 2014, the European Parliament adopted a resolution advocating this approach.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has also recommended criminalising the purchase of sexual services by means of prostitution. <\/p><p>Independent statistics on crime, including prostitution and related offences, are collated and published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  In addition to the work of the CSO, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of my Department publishes annual reports setting out statistical information on alleged victims of human trafficking encountered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, International Organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations working in the field.  The information is disaggregated by gender, age, region of origin and type of exploitation.  The Annual Reports also provides information on the criminal justice response to human trafficking in Ireland.  The reports are available on Ireland's dedicated anti-human trafficking website www.blueblindfold.gov.ie and on my Department's website.  The question of enhancing the knowledge base and data in relation to human trafficking in Ireland will be examined in the context of the 2nd National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Human Beings in Ireland which is currently being drafted.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>The purpose of the new offences is to send a clear message that the purchase of sexual services in the context of prostitution is unlawful and the evidence suggests that making an act unlawful does in itself influence behaviour.

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children annually.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the School Completion Programme programme was funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan and up to 2007, with assistance from the European Social Fund.  In 2006\/2007, the School Completion Programme was subsumed into the School Support Programme, under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) at the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2009, the remit of the then National Educational Welfare Board was extended to include a co-ordinating role in relation to the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme alongside the Board's statutory Educational Welfare Service in order to develop an integrated and model of service to respond to children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  When my Department was established in 2011, it was given a remit to lead the development of harmonised policy and quality integrated service delivery for children and young people, to carry out specific functions in the social care field and co-ordinate actions across a range of sectors, including health, education, youth justice, sport, arts and culture in support of improved outcomes for children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency was established as the dedicated State Agency for improving wellbeing  and outcomes for children under the remit of my Department.  Operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects was assigned to the Agency from that date.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million was provided for the School Completion Programme.  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014\/2015 academic year.  The first two instalments of 2014\/15 funding have been  issued to local projects, with a third instalment planned for payment in May 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The objective in incorporating the School Completion Programme into the Child and Family Agency responsibility is to ensure the provision of effective services for children who have difficulties participating in school; to better integrate the educational welfare services with other support services for children and their families and to bring about an increased emphasis on planning, evidence based services and outcome measurement.<\/p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.  My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.  This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in light of the monies available.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme by the ESRI is almost complete.  The review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and to ensure that it is line with the aims of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people (2014-2020).<\/p>  <p>  The aim is to ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage.  The Review has an important contribution to make to these aims and the future development of the school completion programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000075#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Regulation","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000075#WRO01750"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[10497\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000075#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views regarding the increased levels of administration work imposed on child care centres, in particular, resulting from the programme implementation platform, which has significantly increased the paperwork and time spent on administration for child care providers; if he will provide funding to assist with this administration work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>My Department implements a number of childcare funding programmes that assist parents in accessing affordable and quality childcare services.

However, given the changed economic circumstances since its publication, the Government has had to reduce the numbers employed across the public service in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  While staffing levels in the mental health service have fallen, there are positives that must be acknowledged.  Many of the staff numbers lost were supporting the excessive numbers of beds which are no longer part of the service user recovery focused, modern, community based model for mental health.  The overall reduction in numbers has been mitigated due to the priority ring-fenced Programme for Government investments since 2012.  This has allowed the HSE to begin to re-balance the staff skill mix in mental health and to introduce new staff in the historically under represented disciplines recommended in <i>A Vision for Change <\/i>i.e. psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.<\/p><p>The sustained investment in mental health since 2012 has resulted in over 1,150 new staff for the sector.  As at the end of December 2014, of the 416 approved posts in 2012, approximately 95% (397) are now filled. Of the 477 approved posts in 2013, 78% (367) are filled.  Therefore, approximately 86% of the combined posts over 2012-13 have taken up duty.  The remainder of the vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment, with some difficulties in identifying outstanding candidates, primarily for geographic and qualification reasons.  The recruitment of 225 approved allocated posts for 2014 has commenced with 4 having agreed start dates, a further 5 posts have been accepted, and the remaining posts are at various stages of the recruitment process.  Discussions are currently taking place between the Department of Health and the HSE on the final allocation of the additional &euro;35 million provided for mental health in Budget 2015.  I hope to finalise the allocation of the additional funds with the HSE in the very near future.<\/p><p>It is acknowledged that in recent years, the retention of staff in the mental health service has been challenging, with the numbers employed fluctuating due to departures for various reasons, including redundancy, retirement or staff moving to take up employment elsewhere. However, the recruitment of these new posts, while challenging in the current environment, has enabled the gradual decline in posts to be arrested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000076#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Services Provision","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000076#WRP01650"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[9912\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000076#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the numbers on waiting lists for counselling in primary care for longer than one week, two weeks, two months and three months.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":707,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.<\/p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) Service is a national service provided under the governance framework of the National Counselling Service (NCS) within the Mental Health Division.  It is being funded from the Programme for Government investment in Mental Health, to increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and supplement existing services provided by Primary Care.  Since 2012, this Government has provided funding totalling &euro;7.5 million to develop the CIPC service.  The service provides short term counselling for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 and over and who hold a valid medical card. Referral into the service is by the person&rsquo;s GP or other member of the Primary Care Team.  The establishment of the CIPC initiative is aimed at providing a more immediate response to wider community for persons in need of counselling and advice.  If deemed necessary, persons presenting with more serious crisis issues can be referred on to the appropriate HSE community mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made to see people as quickly as possible, however, there are a number of people waiting extended periods for counselling within the CIPC service, many of whom will have specific requirements, for example can only attend on a specific day or time or may wish to be seen in a particular area.  In some areas, there is particular difficulty for services accessing accommodation in which to see clients, which in turn impacts on waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of a quality counselling service across both primary and secondary care will be developed further, as resources permit.

As Minister for Health, I have overall responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy at Government level.  The Oversight Forum on Drugs, which I chair, is responsible for the high-level monitoring of the Strategy, and solid  progress is being made in delivering on its objectives across the five pillars of treatment, rehabilitation, prevention, supply reduction and research.<\/p>  <p>  Drug law enforcement remains a key priority for the Government.  Drug seizures play a critical role in disrupting crime gangs and in helping to protect communities from the destructive impact of drugs misuse and associated criminality.  Drug seizures valued at approximately &euro;62m were made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during 2014.  This does not include a joint operation involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue Customs Service and the Naval Service which led to the interception of a yacht off Ireland's south-west coast in September 2014 containing cocaine with an estimated street value at that time of over &euro;70m.<\/p>  <p>  There have been marked improvements in access to treatment services.  At the end of December 2014, 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment, and 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week of assessment.  There is much wider coverage of needle exchange services outside the Dublin area, with more than 130 community pharmacies recruited and trained.  In a major effort to reduce drug-related deaths, the HSE is undertaking a pilot project to make the life-saving drug naloxone more widely available to treat overdoses.  Naloxone reverses the effects of drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone if someone overdoses.<\/p>  <p>  The budget of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces has also been protected, with &euro;29m provided for local drugs initiatives this year.  An additional  &euro;2.1m has been provided in the HSE budget this year for measures targeting vulnerable problem drug users, including enhanced residential detoxification and rehabilitation facilities.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to working with my colleagues across Government to ensure full implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  My Department is beginning work on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period after 2016.  The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.  It will also take account of evidence-based research, information and data sources on the extent and nature of problem drug use in Ireland.  As Minister with lead responsibility for drugs policy and Chair of the Oversight Forum on Drugs, I will play an active role in the development of the new Strategy and I look forward to engaging with all interested parties in this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000077#WRQ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000078#WRR00100"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[10090\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000078#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will clarify his previous statements regarding the case of a person (details supplied), when he stated that the person's indemnity has been suspended temporarily, due to specific and serious concerns expressed by other clinical staff regarding patient safety; and if he will confirm that when the Health Service Executive suspends a person, as a precautionary measure, subject to a review and-or investigation, that it does not do so lightly, in view of the lifting of the suspension as being no longer in the public interest.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":774,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[10091\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000078#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will initiate an independent inquiry into the way and the reason the Health Service Executive initiated its inquiry into a person (details supplied) in view of the lack of evidence of that person's alleged threat to patient safety.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":775,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[10092\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000078#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views regarding the continuation  of two inquiries by the Health Service Executive, which precipitated the suspension of a person (details supplied), despite that person's reinstatement and the fact that three reports have vindicated that person's position; the action he will take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":776,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[10093\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000078#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the actions he will take to address an issue relating to persons (details supplied) and the Health Service Executive's suspension of their indemnity.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":777,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 393 to 396, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the decision of the HSE to reinstate the clinical indemnity of the self-employed community midwife.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacterium.  Lyme borelliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011.<\/p><p>Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no <i>erythema migrans <\/i>rash.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to <i>B. burgdorferi<\/i>produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step. Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.<\/p><p>Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks. If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may need to be used.<\/p><p>The standard approach to treatment of Lyme borelliosis is to follow the guidance laid out in the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on the <i>Clinical Assessment, Treatment, and Prevention of Lyme Disease, Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis, and Babesiosis: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America<\/i>.  This is accepted as being the most up to date synthesis of best available evidence on the clinical management of Lyme borelliosis. Treatment of Lyme borelliosis in Ireland is based upon this guidance.<\/p><p>A consensus statement on the clinical management of Lyme borelliosis was been issued jointly from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners in November, 2012 supporting the use of this guidance.<\/p><p>There were 20 cases notified in 2013 and 20 notified cases in 2014, it is expected that this figure will reduce on validation.

I am deeply saddened by his death, and have extended my sympathy to his family. <\/p>  <p>  Mr. Nemtsov was a courageous champion of democratic reforms who fought tirelessly for a more open and tolerant Russia. His loss will be deeply felt not just in Russia, but around the world.<\/p>  <p>  The high esteem in which many Russians held Mr. Nemtsov was evident in the large crowds that attended a vigil in his honour on 1 March and his memorial service two days later, at which Ireland was represented by our Ambassador to Russia. Tens of thousands of people across a wide range of political parties and movements turned out to mourn his loss and pay tribute to his legacy as a fearless reformer who was not afraid to speak out against the direction that Russia was taking and the policies being pursued.  <\/p>  <p>  Mr. Nemtsov's murder highlights the vulnerability of opposition figures in Russia at the present time, where any criticism of government policy is seen by some as an act of disloyalty. He had been a vocal critic of Russia&rsquo;s actions against Ukraine.

The Conference will also examine ways of mobilising domestic tax revenues, a rapidly-growing source of stable development finance, and identify ways of creating an enabling environment to support private sector growth, both domestic and international, in an inclusive and sustainable way.

The school principal manages the school on a day to day basis.<\/p>  <p>  As my Department has no role in the employment of staff in schools or schools' day to day management, a complaint about the child's school and its staff is proper to the school itself.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, my Department does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of action with regard to individual complaint cases. In dealing with complaints, the Department's role is to provide advice to parents and students on the operation of schools' complaints procedures and to clarify for parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.<\/p>  <p>  Complaints from parents are often received by phone, and across all sections of the Department.  These are attended to contemporaneously in detail by telephone and are not logged.  It is therefore not possible to provide data in any accurate format as to how many such complaints have been received in the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory role and functions of the Children's Ombudsman are set out under sections 8 and 9 of the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002. The Act empowers the Children's Ombudsman to investigate the administrative procedures followed by a school board of management provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the schools complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman is that a child has, or may have been negatively affected by the action of a school.<\/p>  <p>  Queries as to the volume of complaints which have been received by the Ombudsman for Children should be directed to that office, which is contactable at oco@oco.ie or 1800 20 20 40.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that I plan to provide in law for a Parent and Student Charter. Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important. If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision parents are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions.<\/p>  <p>  This charter may be underpinned by legislation if necessary. I believe there is a need to look at how a stronger culture of valuing parental involvement at the level of each individual school can be created.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000084#WRX00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":1057,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000084#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1058,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[10447\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000084#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out the position regarding the loss of a teaching post in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1059,"content":"<p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department website.

In addition, &euro;79m in capital savings from 2009 will be carried forward into 2010, bringing total capital funding available for education in 2010 to &euro;794m. \r\n\r\n- The total funding available is a decrease of less than 7pc compared to the allocation for 2009.\r\n\r\n- &euro;579m will be allocated to continue the significant investment being made in the school building programme. That includes &euro;72m from the capital carry-over.\r\n\r\n- Given the reduction in tender prices, it&rsquo;s expected that the Department will be able to deliver a similar-sized programme of large and small-scale building projects in primary and post-primary schools in 2010 as was delivered in 2009. As well as providing for all contractual commitments on existing projects, the building programme will include a further batch of major new school or extension projects to proceed to tender and construction during 2010. There will also be a Summer Works Scheme incorporating water conservation measures.  \r\n\r\n- &euro;141m is being provided for infrastructural investment in higher education of which &euro;46m will be provided for investment under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.\r\n\r\n- &euro;50m is being allocated to support the integration of information and communications technology in teaching and learning in schools. That includes &euro;7m from the capital carry-over.\r\n\r\n- Provision has also been made in the capital allocation for the continuation of the Department&rsquo;s public-private partnership programme.\r\n\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\n- The current allocation for 2010 is &euro;8.168bn which is a reduction of 4.9pc over the 2009 outturn. The reduction includes a general pay-related adjustment of &euro;350m in line with the Government decision to reduce public service pay rates.  This accounts for 4pc of the reduction. The distribution of this pay adjustment across subheads will be included in the context of the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume.\r\n\r\nAdditional expenditure measures\r\n\r\n- &euro;12m is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide 500 extra teachers over the next three years. This allocation will allow for the employment of an extra 200 teachers starting in early 2010 and a further 150 teachers starting in September 2010.\r\n\r\n- &euro;14m is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide extra teachers from September 2010 for the 2010\/11 school year to meet demographic pressures and to ensure no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio. This allocation will fund 600 posts in primary schools and 330 posts in post-primary schools.\r\n\r\n- &euro;19m is being provided to maintain school capitation grants at current levels and to take account of increased pupil numbers. This allocation will also enable extra funding to be allocated to schools for school books and to support curricular activities as provided in the Renewed Programme for Government.\r\n\r\n- The allocation for the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is being increased by &euro;7.5m to meet additional expenditure on allowances due to the change in profile of applicants for the scheme.\r\n\r\nAn extra allocation of &euro;3m is being provided for the promotion of Gaeilge in schools as part of the new 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language.\r\n\r\nThe provision for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is being increased to provide for the rise in psychologists to 210. This will allow NEPS psychologists to provide direct service to every first and second level school and an enhancement of service to special schools and units.\r\n\r\nHigher education\r\n\r\n- The provision in 2010 for universities and institutes of technology is &euro;1,194m - a 9pc reduction on the 2009 provision of &euro;1,318m.\r\n\r\n- The reduction in funding takes account of the general pay cut, targeted reductions in numbers employed under an employment control framework for the sector. It will also involve further non-pay cost efficiencies.  \r\n\r\n- Just under &euro;130m is being provided to higher education institutions in 2010 for research activities including capital research funding. This underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to focussed delivery of its Science, Technology and Innovation strategy. As part of this, it&rsquo;s intended that investments under Cycle 5 of the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions will proceed. The assessment process for PRTLI 5 awards will conclude in early 2010 and, in line with normal lead-in times, major elements of expenditure commitments are anticipated to materialise from 2011 onwards.  \r\n\r\nThe funding available in 2010 for projects under the Strategic Innovation Fund is &euro;18m - a reduction of &euro;8m on 2009. This reduced allocation will require a further curtailment of project activity. Priority will continue to be given to projects aimed at upskiilling and reskilling for employment.\r\n\r\nStudent grants and scholarships\r\n\r\nA reduction of 5pc is being applied to the rates of student grants and scholarships. This will achieve &euro;10m in savings in 2010. However, the overall allocation for student support will be increased in 2010 to take account of increased numbers of students.\r\n\r\nThe reduction will be implemented to all existing and new grant-holders from January 2010. This is in line with reductions in other income maintenance payments including those for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nA further saving of &euro;4m will be made by the removal of eligibility for student support grants from people in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing a Post-Leaving Certificate course. However, the cost of the student service charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met by the Exchequer on their behalf.  This will apply to all new grant-holders in 2010 onwards.\r\n\r\nSupport under the Millennium Partnership Fund is being withdrawn saving &euro;2m.\r\n\r\nAdult and further education\r\n\r\nThe number of places provided in Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) will be reduced from 984 places to 684 places. This in line with the Traveller Education Strategy. Travellers can continue to access the full range of adult and further education programmes across the country.  \r\n\r\nAllowances to participants in VTOS, Youthreach and STTCs will be reduced in line with the appropriate social welfare rates or F&Aacute;S trainee allowances.\r\n\r\nTeacher education\r\n\r\nThe provision for teacher in-service education support is &euro;29.79m compared with a 2009 estimate of &euro;40m. Restructuring of existing services will continue in 2010. Services will be focused on priority areas including special educational needs, child protection guidelines training, implementation of new procedures for underperforming teachers, and Project Maths.\r\n\r\nThe allocation for pre-service teacher education is being reduced by &euro;3m and will be achieved by reducing the number of post-graduate conversion places.\r\n\r\nTeacher sick leave and substitution\r\n\r\n- The supply teacher scheme at primary level will cease from the start of the 2010\/11 school year. Normal substitution arrangements which apply to primary schools generally to cover teacher absences will be used to cover substitution in those schools that participated in the scheme.\r\n\r\n- From the start of the 2010\/11 school year, the maximum number of uncertified sick leave days allowed in the school year for teachers in primary, secondary and community and comprehensive schools will be reduced to seven days. This is the same number of days available for teachers in vocational schools and community colleges.\r\n\r\nSchool transport\r\n\r\nThe provision for school transport is &euro;186m compared with a 2009 out-turn of &euro;178m. While efficiencies made during 2009 will continue to yield savings in 2010, an increase of &euro;8m is being provided which includes provision for new services as necessary.\r\n\r\nReduction in allocations to education bodies\r\n\r\n- National Council for Curriculum and Assessment reduced by &euro;0.93m;\r\n\r\n- National Council for Special Education reduced by &euro;2.3m;\r\n\r\n- Higher Education Authority reduced by &euro;0.562m;\r\n\r\n- Dublin Dental Hospital reduced by &euro;0.410m;\r\n\r\n- Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies reduced by &euro;0.546m;\r\n\r\n- Royal Irish Academy of Music reduced by &euro;0.303m;\r\n\r\n- National Qualifications Framework (NQAI, FETAC, HETAC) current allocation reduced by &euro;2.1m;\r\n\r\nOther current\r\n\r\nFurther savings will be made from expenditure efficiencies in the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget (excluding NEPS) achieving &euro;2.4m. \r\n\r\nProcurement savings of &euro;5.2 million\r\n\r\nThe allocation of &euro;5m funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund will allow for the continuation of existing schemes to counteract educational disadvantage funded from this source.\r\n\r\nFunding will be reduced by &euro;1.2m in 2010 for projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas in Dublin city and county. Funding provided by the Department for these projects will be phased out in 2011.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","counter":1082,"content":"<p>2011 Estimates for Education and Skills Vote<\/p>  <p>Main Features<\/p>  <p>OVERALL ALLOCATION<\/p>  <p>- The gross overall Voted allocation for the Department for 2011 will be &euro;8.888 billion. This compares to a 2010 provisional outturn of &euro;8.974 billion, representing a reduction of 1%. In addition the Estimate includes provision for expenditure of some &euro;362 million under the National Training Fund in 2011, which is a reduction of 8% over the 2010 provisional outturn, due mainly to a projected significant reduction in fund income in 2011.<\/p>  <p>CURRENT EXPENDITURE<\/p>  <p>- A provision for current expenditure of &euro;8.387 billion has been made for 2011.

A further &euro;362 million of current expenditure is provided for under the National Training Fund.  The 2011 allocation takes account of upward expenditure pressures mainly in relation to student support payments, the cost of pensions and demographic increases.

With effect from the 2011\/2012 school year a transport fee of &euro;50 per annum will be introduced for primary school pupils, with a maximum family charge of &euro;110 applying. This charge is being introduced to ensure that school transport provided for eligible primary pupils is fully utilised. The annual charge for post-primary pupils will be increased by &euro;50 from &euro;300 to &euro;350. The combined maximum overall family charge will remain at &euro;650.<\/p>  <p>- Changes in the 2011\/2012 school year arising from the value for money review will include:<\/p>  <p>- The distance criteria will be applied to all pupils attending primary schools and the exemption under the closed school rule will cease. This means that children who reside less than 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from the school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school under the closed school rule will lose their transport eligibility;<\/p>  <p>- Services under the minimum numbers, either single services or which are part of double tripping arrangements, will be discontinued. A pick up density of pupils in a distinct locality on a particular route &ndash; increasing from the current minimum of 7 to 10 eligible children &ndash; will be required to establish or retain services.<\/p>  <p>- Further changes from the review, which will take effect from a later date, will include the following:<\/p>  <p>- From the 2012\/13 school year, eligibility based on the closed school rule (CSR) and the central school rule will cease for all new children entering primary schools. Existing primary pupils availing of transport under the CSR will retain transport eligibility for the duration of their schooling, provided the requisite distance is met;<\/p>  <p>- From the 2012\/13 school year, the use of the catchment boundary system will cease for all new post-primary children. Eligibility for all new children entering post-primary transport will be on the basis of the nearest post-primary centre or school. Existing arrangements will remain in place for existing post primary pupils for the duration of their schooling;<\/p>  <p>- New arrangements will be put in place with Bus &Eacute;ireann on a phased basis for the operation of the scheme. These will include arrangements for an increasing proportion of routes to be provided by private operators. From the 2012\/13 school year, Bus &Eacute;ireann will have full responsibility for the operation of the school transport system including responsibility for processing all applications for school transport or grants.  Synergies between school transport, rural transport and Health Service Executive services will be further developed.<\/p>  <p>Schools<\/p>  <p>- &euro;22 million in savings will be secured in 2011 through an average 5% reduction in funding grants to schools and Vocational Educational Committees (including mainstream and ancillary grants for schools), and including grants for Adult Literacy, Community Education, School Completion Programme, Youthreach. This will reduce capitation rates to those that applied to schools between 2007 and 2008. (There will also be a similar reduction in capitation rates payable in respect of Senior Traveller Training Centres, VTOS (Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme) and PLC (Post-Leaving Certificate) students). Details of the revised rates for each grant category will be issued to schools and VECs shortly. Reduced rates will also apply to ancillary and support services grants to reflect the reduction in pay that will apply to personnel who are paid from these grants, and who have not yet had the reduction applied to them, with effect from January 2011, e.g. school cleaners and caretakers.<\/p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation for teacher salaries of almost &euro;3.85 billion takes account of &euro;24 million in savings (rising to &euro;98 million in 2014) to be achieved by reducing teacher numbers through a combination of measures. These measures will lead to a deferral of 150 extra posts and to a reduction of up to approximately 1,200 posts from September 2011 (approximately 700 primary and 500 post-primary posts) which, however, will be partly offset by the addition of an estimated 875 new posts due to demographics. The measures to reduce teacher posts include:<\/p>  <p>- Deferral of the provision of 150 extra teachers originally planned to be allocated at primary and post-primary level in September 2011;<\/p>  <p>- Changing the existing favourable pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) to the standard PTR for the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP). Currently, the allocation of teachers to the LCVP is on the basis of 1 teacher for every 17 pupils. This will be changed from September 2011 to the standard allocation basis of 1 teacher for every 19 pupils (or 1 teacher for every 20 pupils in the case of fee-charging schools). This measure will secure savings of approximately 200 posts; <\/p>  <p>- Standardising the staffing schedule for Gaelscoileanna to the same that operates for other ordinary national schools, the estimated yield from which will be some 50 posts;<\/p>  <p>- Withdrawal of Resource Teachers for Travellers posts at primary level so that educational teaching supports to Traveller students will now be provided on the same basis as other students in schools. Alleviation measures will be put in place for schools with a high concentration of Traveller children. At post-primary level teaching hours for Travellers will be withdrawn, again with alleviation measures for schools with high concentrations of Traveller children. This measure will secure savings of approximately 600 posts net.<\/p>  <p>- A phased reduction of 500 over four years in the number of Language Support Teachers, through a demand driven reduction and, if necessary, a change in allocation rules over the period of the plan. A first year reduction of some 125 posts is targeted with effect from September 2011; <\/p>  <p>- The redeployment of some 170 existing supernumerary posts in post-primary schools from September 2011;<\/p>  <p>- The removal of 47 primary rural co-ordinator teaching posts currently allocated to DEIS rural primary schools. All of these schools, however, will continue to receive other DEIS supports including financial support, professional development supports, school meals and school books supports; <\/p>  <p>- The withdrawal from September 2011 of 42 Visiting Teachers for Travellers posts, currently assigned to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The School Support services, including the School Completion Programme and the Home School Liaison Service under the NEWB, will be adapted to undertake work with Travellers in the future.<\/p>  <p>- In line with the Traveller Education Strategy and the 2008 value for money review of Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs), integrated further education provision for Travellers will be implemented through the phasing out of STTCs by June 2012 and replacement places, prioritised for Travellers, being provided under the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI).  This means there will be no new enrolments in STTCs from 1 January 2011.<\/p>  <p>- &euro;10 million in savings will be secured from rule changes and efficiencies in relation to supervision and substitution arrangements in schools. This will include implementation of the flexibility measures provided for under the Croke Park Agreement whereby post-primary teachers will be available for an extra class period each week to cover for absent colleagues. There will also be a general tightening of the rules covering substitution.<\/p>  <p>Special Needs Assistants<\/p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation for pay for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) will be approximately &euro;350 million, compared to an allocation of &euro;335 for 2010. The allocation provides for the full-year costs of SNAs appointed in 2010. While there will be no reduction in the SNA numbers in 2011 it is intended to place a cap on these numbers. The Department will in this regard work with the National Council for Special Education to develop a new system to manage SNA provision within the total numbers allocation. All schools will be advised of the new system.<\/p>  <p>Further and Higher Education<\/p>  <p>- The 2011 provision for Universities, Institutes of Technology and other higher education institutions is &euro;1.176 billion. Net of adjustments for increased income in respect of the Student Contribution Charge of &euro;2,000, the overall 2011 Allocation includes &euro;55.8m in respect of Nurses Education transferred from D\/Health and also includes a further 1.5% cut in the pay allocation and 5% in the non-payallocation.<\/p>  <p>- Further savings of &euro;27 million will be achieved by replacing the existing &euro;1,500 per year Student Services Charge with a flat higher education Student Contribution of &euro;2,000 with effect from the 2011\/2012 academic year.  The Student Contribution will apply to all students who currently benefit under the &lsquo;free fees&rsquo; scheme.  Higher education institutions will be asked to consider how they could put in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the charge in two equal instalments of 50% in September and 50% in January in a given academic year.  The contribution will be paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the third level grant schemes.  These students, who account for some 43% of all undergraduates, will not be impacted by any increase in charges.  The Government is also aware of the particular financial pressures that this charge may place on families where family income is marginally in excess of current eligibility levels for maintenance grant support and on families with more than one sibling in higher education at the same time.  With this in mind, the current higher education grants schemes threshold will be increased to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for &lsquo;50% Student Contribution&rsquo; (see detail in Appendix). In addition, arrangements will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new &euro;2,000 charge.<\/p>  <p>- The introduction of a new &euro;200 annual contribution for Post Leaving Certificate students will secure savings of &euro;4 million in 2011. The cost of the charge will be met by the Exchequer on behalf of those students who are eligible under the maintenance grant scheme for students attending PLC courses. Eligible students may include those in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance provided that they meet all of the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme.<\/p>  <p>- Provision of further education opportunities in 2011 will be largely the same as that in 2010, with over 173,000 participants benefiting from VEC interventions. <\/p>  <p>Student Support<\/p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation for student support payments is &euro;386 million. This represents an increase of some 7% over 2010 and reflects both increased numbers of students qualifying for grants and a greater proportion of students qualifying for higher rates of grants, which are means tested.<\/p>  <p>- The current higher education grants schemes threshold will be increased to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for &lsquo;50% Student Contribution&rsquo; (see Appendix).<\/p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation also takes account of savings of some &euro;22 million (rising to some &euro;51 million in 2014), to be achieved through implementing a range of savings measures in the student support scheme. These measures include:<\/p>  <p>- A 4% reduction in the rate of student support grants, reflecting the reductions in rates of social protection payments announced in the Budget. This will yield savings of &euro;8 million;<\/p>  <p>- Changing the qualifying distance criterion for entitlement to the higher non-adjacent rate of grant (distance from home to the higher education institution) from 15 miles (24 kilometres) to 28 miles (45 kilometres).  The original distance criterion was set in 1968, before the significant improvement in transport facilities and road networks which has taken place. This measure will yield &euro;10 million of savings in 2011 (&euro;30 million in 2014);<\/p>  <p>- Savings of &euro;4 million (&euro;13 million in 2014) will be secured by reducing the automatic eligibility of mature students to the higher non-adjacent rate of payment, thereby bringing the arrangements for mature students into line with all other students.<\/p>  <p>Skills and Training<\/p>  <p>- Savings of approximately &euro;10 million will be achieved in the area of training allowances and supports.  This includes a reduction, consistent with reductions in social protection rates announced in the Budget, of &euro;8 per week in all weekly training allowances and similar support payments. The long-term unemployment bonus paid to VTOS (Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme) students and to FAS trainees will be reduced from &euro;31.80 per week to &euro;20 per week.<\/p>  <p>- The allocation for Skills and Training includes provision for a number of measures to strengthen the framework of labour market activation supports for the unemployed, as part of the National Recovery Plan. These will include the introduction in 2011 of a Skills Development and Internship Programme and an expansion of the number of placements available on the Work Placement Programme. While provision for training and activation for the unemployed will have to have regard to the reduced availability of funding, the above measures will seek to enhance the quality of offering for unemployed persons. All further education programmes will also continue to be open to the unemployed and unemployed people undertaking these programmes may be eligible to participate in the Back to Education Allowance Scheme. The Labour Market Activation Fund will be targeted at specific priority groups among the unemployed, including the low skilled and those formerly employed in declining sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35s and the long-term unemployed.<\/p>  <p>- In Budget 2011 the allocation to F&Aacute;S for training the unemployed was decreased by &euro;43 million or approximately 15%. This will result in an equivalent reduction of 15,410 training places that F&Aacute;S can deliver for the unemployed next year. This will imply that FAS will deliver approximately 100,000 training places next year as opposed to the 115,000 they are delivering this year. <\/p>  <p>Other current expenditure items<\/p>  <p>- The reduced 2011 allocation of &euro;18.6 million for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) takes account of &euro;3 million in savings to be secured through capping at 178 the number of psychologists in the service;<\/p>  <p>- A saving of &euro;1 million in 2011, rising to &euro;12 million in 2014, will be achieved through the impact of a 10% reduction in salary scales for new entrants to the public service, with all new entrants starting on the minimum point of the new scale.<\/p>  <p>- &euro;16 million in savings (&euro;39 million in 2014) will be achieved through further reductions in public service numbers on the Education and Skills Vote, including in the Non-Commercial State Agencies under the aegis of the Department. These reductions are on foot of the updated Employment Control Framework in the National Recovery Plan, to control public sector numbers.<\/p>  <p>- A further &euro;18 million in savings will be achieved through a range of non-pay administrative savings, the management of emerging expenditure pressures and other estimating savings.<\/p>  <p>- The 2011 allocation of &euro;77 million for the Administrative Budget subheads A1 to A8 includes an additional &euro;1.6 million in staff costs as a result of the transfer of functions in May 2010. When account is taken of this the 2011 allocation for these subheads represents a reduction of 2% on 2010. <\/p>  <p>- The 2011 allocations to a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department reflect reductions in payroll and other administrative savings.<\/p>  <p>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE<\/p>  <p>- The capital allocation for 2011 will be &euro;501 million. The figure reflects the overall medium-term reduction in capital investment announced in the National Recovery Plan.<\/p>  <p>- The capital expenditure envelope for education of almost &euro;1.9 billion over the period of the plan will provide for meeting demographic needs in primary and post-primary schools and for some improvement in the stock of school buildings. The allocation will also provide for some prioritised investment in third-level infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>- The capital allocation for 2011 for Schools Information and Communications Technology of &euro;1.5 million is significantly lower than the 2010 allocation of &euro;63 million, which includes an allocation of &euro;20 million recently provided by way of Supplementary Estimate. This reflects the very significant capital investment in Schools ICT in 2009 and 2010 as part of the &lsquo;smart schools&rsquo; programme.  The focus in 2011 will be on leveraging this significant investment to ensure further integration of ICT into teaching and learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000084#WRX02625","nonspeaker":""},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1083,"content":"<p>APPENDIX\r\n\r\nHIGHER EDUCATION GRANTS SCHEME 2010Reckonable income limits for the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 (the tax year 2009):To qualify for: \u25baNumber of dependent children: \u25bc- Special Rate*\r\n\r\n- 100% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- Student Service Charge- 100% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- Student Service Charge- 75% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- Student Service Charge- 50% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- Student Service Charge- 25% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- Student Service Charge- 50% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- Student Service ChargeLess than 4&euro;22,703&euro;41,110&euro;42,235&euro;44,720&euro;47,205&euro;51,3804-7&euro;22,703&euro;45,165&euro;46,415&euro;49,145&euro;51,880&euro;56,4608 or more&euro;22,703&euro;49,045&euro;50,400&euro;53,360&euro;56,320&euro;61,295* Must be in receipt of eligible social welfare payment to qualify for the Special Rate.\r\n\r\n** Where fees are applicable, eg. postgraduate courses.PROPOSED REVISED RECKONABLE INCOME LIMITS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION GRANTS SCHEME 2011\r\n\r\nincluding additional category of eligibility&lsquo;Student Service Charge&rsquo; replaced by &lsquo;Student Contribution&rsquo;.\r\n\r\nReckonable income limits for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 (the tax year 2010):To qualify for: \u25baNumber of dependent children: \u25bc- Special Rate*\r\n\r\n- 100% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- 100% Student Contribution- 100% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- 100% Student Contribution- 75% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- 100% Student Contribution- 50% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- 100% Student Contribution- 25% Maintenance\r\n\r\n- 100% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- 100% Student Contribution- 50% Tuition Fees**\r\n\r\n- 100% Student Contribution- 50% Student ContributionLess than 4&euro;22,703&euro;41,110&euro;42,235&euro;44,720&euro;47,205&euro;51,380&euro;55,9204-7&euro;22,703&euro;45,165&euro;46,415&euro;49,145&euro;51,880&euro;56,460&euro;61,4408 or more&euro;22,703&euro;49,045&euro;50,400&euro;53,360&euro;56,320&euro;61,295&euro;66,700* Must be in receipt of eligible social welfare payment to qualify for the Special Rate.\r\n\r\n** Where fees are applicable, eg. postgraduate courses.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","counter":1084,"content":"<p>2012 MAIN FEATURES<\/p>  <p>Main Estimate Features <\/p>  <p>- Net savings in 2012 are some &euro;76 million, rising to &euro;157 million in 2013 and &euro;241 million in 2014.<\/p>  <p>- When account is taken of savings measures outlined below the Department of Education and Skills will have to identify further savings of approximately &euro;68 million in 2013 and a further &euro;138 million in 2014 in order to live within the expenditure ceilings set for those years. <\/p>  <p>- An allocation of nearly &euro;10 million is being provided in 2012 to commence implementation of actions in the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, work on Junior Cycle reform and phased rollout of high speed (100mbps) broadband to second level schools. <\/p>  <p>Labour Activation Measures <\/p>  <p>- &euro;20 million is being provided under the National Training Fund for a new Labour Market Activation Fund.  This fund, which will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed, will deliver upward of 6,500 places in 2012.    <\/p>  <p>- &euro;10 million is being allocated, also under the National Training Fund, to support a further roll-out of the Springboard initiative to increase the part time higher education opportunities for unemployed people. A new competitive tendering process for Springboard will take place in the first quarter of 2012.<\/p>  <p>Special Needs Education<\/p>  <p>- The overall number of resource teachers and SNAs provided for children with special education needs is being maintained.  Allocations will continue to be managed within existing resources.<\/p>  <p>DEIS (disadvantage school scheme)<\/p>  <p>- While DEIS schools are not immune to budgetary measures, a key priority is to target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>- At primary level, a new staffing schedule for all 199 DEIS Band 1 schools will be based on a general average of 1 teacher for every 22 pupils.  This will replace the existing approach of giving a &ldquo;top up&rdquo; allocation on the existing standard staffing schedule to enable DEIS Band 1 schools to implement reduced class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes.  <\/p>  <p>- While the new staffing schedule gives greater autonomy to DEIS Band 1 schools, the schools should continue to prioritise their staffing allocation to implement more favourable pupil teacher ratios in junior classes, in line with DEIS policy.  <\/p>  <p>- All DEIS second level schools will be given targeted support through a more favourable staffing PTR of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second level schools.  195 second level schools are included in DEIS.<\/p>  <p>- The creation of the two dedicated DEIS staffing schedules at primary and second level will be accompanied by a phased withdrawal of 428 legacy posts.  These posts were allocated to some schools under previous disadvantage programmes prior to the DEIS initiative of 2005.  To help those schools considered to be particularly adversely affected by this decision the posts will be gradually withdrawn over a three year period starting in 2012\/13 school year.  The new DEIS Band 1 staffing schedule and reduced PTR for second level DEIS schools will apply immediately to these schools from September 2012. <\/p>  <p>- 20 of these 428 posts being withdrawn will be re-allocated for the purposes of providing the continuous professional development element of the Department&rsquo;s Literacy and Numeracy strategy which also has a focus on tackling educational disadvantage and is a key commitment in the Programme for Government. <\/p>  <p>- The five existing scholarship schemes for higher education are being replaced with a single bursary style, merit based scheme with awards set at &euro;2,000 per student.   The bursary will be an additional support to incentivise and reward high achievement for students from DEIS schools.  Students who are awarded the bursary will also be eligible to apply for higher education grants.   Allocation in 2012 &euro;130,000 rising to an estimated &euro;750,000 in 2015.<\/p>  <p>Posts of Responsibility in second level schools<\/p>  <p>- Provision is being made within the overall pay budget to allow for further alleviation measures in relation to the filling of additional Assistant Principal posts  in second level schools. This measure is intended to ensure, as far as possible in 2012\/13, that second level schools will be able to maintain approximately 50% of the number of Assistant Principal posts they held prior to the introduction of the moratorium.<\/p>  <p>Teacher Allocations<\/p>  <p>- There will be no increase in the general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level for the 2012\/13 school year.  <\/p>  <p>- Starting in 2012, phased adjustments will be made to the staffing schedules for 1, 2, 3 and 4 teacher primary schools (schools with less than 86 pupils).  These adjustments will increase the minimum number of pupils required for allocation of teaching posts.  The phasing of these measures provides the schools concerned with time to consider their future and the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  This change will yield an estimated 250 posts (100 posts in 2012).  Saving in 2012 &euro;1.5 million. Full year saving &euro;15 million.  <\/p>  <p>- At second level, with effect from 2012\/13 school year guidance provision will be managed by schools from within their standard teacher allocation. At present a separate allocation is made for guidance.  This measure is an alternative to making a change to the overall staffing schedule.   This approach means that schools have greater autonomy and have the flexibility to decide the precise resources they wish to allocate for guidance balanced against the other demands on available staff resources.   The change is estimated to yield net savings of 500 posts when provision is made for the reduced staffing schedule for DEIS schools. Saving in 2012 &euro;10.4 million. Full year saving &euro;32 million.<\/p>  <p>- In addition to the new arrangements for guidance posts there will also be a 1 point increase in the staffing schedule for all fee-charging schools. These changes will increase the PTR for fee-paying schools to 21:1 with effect from the 2012\/13 school year.  In order to inform future policy on the potential extent and nature of Exchequer investment, including funding for teacher posts, in the fee-charging sector in subsequent years the Department will conduct a specific analysis on tuition fee income available to schools in the sector and its utilisation. The 1-point increase in the staffing schedule is estimated to yield savings of 50 posts. Saving in 2012 &euro;1 million.   Full year saving &euro;3.2 million.  <\/p>  <p>- Budget 2010 contained a provision to reduce language support posts over a 4 year period from an original level of about 1,400 posts to a reduced level of about 900 posts in 2014\/15 school year. The current level of language support posts is about 1,120 posts. The remaining reduction of about 220 posts will be implemented in the 2013\/14 and 2014\/15 school years.  Most of this reduction will be at primary level as this is the sector where most are currently allocated.<\/p>  <p>- Some limited alleviation arrangements will be put in place by the Department for those primary and post-primary schools that are most adversely affected by the staffing changes announced today. The details will be notified to schools in early January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000084#WRX02643","nonspeaker":""},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1085,"content":"<p>Summary position on Teacher numbers for 2012\/13 school year-Summary position on Teacher numbers for 2012\/13 school yearPrimary sector \r\n\r\n(posts)Second level sector  (posts)Total postsTarget savings from budget measures -250-700-950Estimated additional posts to cater for increased demographics +500 +250 +750 Net change in overall number of posts  +250 -450 -200<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1086,"content":"<p>When account is taken of additional posts for demographics at primary and second level the net overall reduction on teaching posts for the 2012\/13 school year compared to the current school year is estimated to be of the order of 200 posts. This represents an estimated net reduction of about 0.3% on overall teacher numbers for the 2012\/13 school year compared to the current 2011\/12 school year.  \r\n\r\n- The budget measures announced today include target savings of a further 520 teaching posts (490 posts at primary level and 30 posts at second level) that come into effect from the 2013\/14 school year onwards.  \r\n\r\n- At this stage the target savings are calculated based on estimates.  The actual position will become clearer as the allocation process is progressed and the impact of demographics for each school is known.  \r\n\r\n- The reductions in teacher numbers are predicated on effective redeployment arrangements.  It remains the case that a situation where surplus teachers could remain in schools is not sustainable.\r\n\r\nReform of the teacher allocation process\r\n\r\n- In addition to the savings measures, reforms to the existing teacher allocations process will come into effect from the 2012\/13 school year onwards.  The primary objectives of the reforms are to increase school autonomy and to help the teacher allocation process to operate more smoothly within a climate of fixed ceilings on teaching posts. The changes are designed to give a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools, give earlier certainty to schools about their staffing allocations and, where possible, simplify existing processes and give schools greater discretion on how posts are used.\r\n\r\nReview of Teacher Allowances\r\n\r\n- Pending completion of the public service-wide review of allowances and given the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances, the Government has decided to make changes, with immediate effect, to the rules governing payment of qualification allowances to teachers.\r\n\r\n- Any teacher being employed for the first time in a recognised school will not be able to obtain an allowance at a level greater than that applying to those who hold an honours degree. This means that qualifications at Masters or Doctorate level will not be paid and those who hold a H.Dip will not be permitted through any combination of allowances to exceed the level of allowance payable in respect of an Honours Degree.\r\n\r\n- This measure does not affect allowances being paid at present to existing teachers.  However those teachers will not be paid any additional allowance if they acquire any further qualification. Allowances paid for qualifications that relate to specific posts will continue to be paid but will be subject to examination in the review.\r\n\r\nFunding for Schools \/ School Programmes\r\n\r\n- Overall there will be a 2% reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools in each of 2012 and 2013 and a further 1% reduction in each of 2014 and 2015.

The new basic rate for primary schools will be &euro;183. This is above the rate of &euro;178.58 that applied in the 2007\/2008 school year. For secondary schools the new rate will be &euro;317 which is the rate that applied from 1 January 2007 with a pro rata reduction in the funding allocation to Community and Comprehensive schools and VEC schools.\r\n\r\n- In order to inform future policy In relation to the equalisation of funding between voluntary secondary schools and other schools the Minister has asked his officials to update the data on the funding differences in each sector.\r\n\r\n- The basic capitation reduction will apply to all schools but all DEIS schools will continue to receive the enhanced DEIS grant payment which is not being reduced.\r\n\r\n- Other grants paid to schools including ancillary and support services funding and book grants will remain at current rates. \r\n\r\n- The Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative, which has operated on a pilot basis since 1998, will be abolished.

When account is taken of these measures the Department of Education and Skills will require further savings of some &euro;44 million in 2014 in order to live within the expenditure ceiling set for that year.\r\n\r\nPrimary &amp;amp; Second Level staffing:\r\n\r\nAt primary level the staffing schedule has been protected at 28:1.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, at second level the staffing arrangements in all free schools have been maintained.  In DEIS schools this figure is 18.25:1 and in mainstream schools it is 19:1.\r\n\r\nFee-charging schools\r\n\r\nAt a time of severely reduced resources, priorities have to be made.  In an effort to ensure fairness in the education system, the PTR in fee charging schools will rise by two points to 23:1 in September 2013.\r\n\r\nA report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools will be published in the New Year.  This report is expected to show that fee charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding.\r\n\r\nDEIS schools\r\n\r\nDelivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) schools have been protected in this Budget.  There have been no changes to overall teacher numbers or funding for DEIS schools as a result of this Budget.\r\n\r\nSpecial Education \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the number of Resource Teachers (9,950) has been maintained as has the number of SNAs (10,575).  A total of approximately &euro;1.3 billion will be spent on special education in 2013 &ndash; the same as in 2012.\r\n\r\nReducing the Cost of substitution for teachers &amp;amp; SNAs\r\n\r\nSick Leave:\r\n\r\nCivil servants are required to be referred to the occupational health service after four weeks of sick leave.  Up until now, schools have not been required to refer teachers and SNAs until 12 weeks and 8 weeks of sick leave respectively.  These sick leave arrangements will be made similar to those operating in the civil service and are estimated to save &euro;4 million per annum in substitution costs.\r\n\r\nMaternity and Adoptive Leave in Lieu: \r\n\r\nCurrently teachers and SNAs on maternity leave are entitled to an additional maximum of 30 paid absence days, in lieu of days during their period of maternity leave when the schools were closed. This benefit was introduced at a time when paid maternity leave stood at 14 weeks, rather than the 26 weeks that currently operates and was to compensate for school closures which occurred during the maternity leave period. The cost of covering the substitution for these absences in 2011\/12 was approximately &euro;20 million.  This arrangement, which is not available to other public servants or private sector workers, is to be ended. This will not affect a teacher&rsquo;s or SNA&rsquo;s entitlements to 26 weeks&rsquo; paid leave and an optional 16 weeks&rsquo; unpaid maternity leave. A similar change will be made in respect of adoptive leave in lieu. The new measure will be introduced on May 1st 2013 in order to give some advance notice.  It will result in savings of &euro;11 million in 2013 and &euro;20 million in a full year.\r\n\r\nFURTHER EDUCATION \r\n\r\nPLC Pupil Teacher Ratio\r\n\r\nThe PTR for Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programmes will be harmonised with mainstream second level schools, from 17:1 to 19:1.  This will result in a reduction of 200 PLC teaching posts and a saving of &euro;4 million in 2013 rising to &euro;12 million in a full year.  However, there should be no adverse impact on the number of PLC places available.\r\n\r\nReduce supports to Further Education &amp;amp; Training (FET) scheme participants\r\n\r\nCurrently, jobseekers who enrol in VTOS, Youthreach and FAS training schemes can have their Jobseeker payments (personal rate) increased to the maximum &euro;188 per week, in cases where their jobseeker payment is less than this.  This arrangement will be discontinued in January, with jobseekers who move on to these schemes remaining on their existing rate of payment. However, people under 25 will continue to have their payment increased up to a maximum of &euro;160.  This decision has been taken as it is no longer considered necessary to provide a financial incentive to people to take up FET places.  The measure will apply to new entrants and will save &euro;10.5 million in 2013 and &euro;21 million in a full year.  The measure is being replicated by the Department of Social Protection in relation to the Back to Education Allowance scheme.\r\n\r\nReduce allocations to VECs in 2013\r\n\r\nThe 2013 allocation to the VECs will be reduced by &euro;13.2 million. Notwithstanding the reduction, there will be no reduction in the level of services provided in 2013.  However, VECs will be required to manage within their existing cash reserves on hand.\r\n\r\nTARGETED SKILLS PROVISION \r\n\r\nIn 2013, the National Training Fund expenditure will see provision of: \r\n\r\n- &euro;20 million for a further call under the Labour Market Education and Training Fund, which will be targeted at the long-term unemployed and will deliver some 6,500 places in 2013;\r\n\r\n- &euro;23 million in respect of the Springboard initiative  to increase the part time higher education opportunities for unemployed people; and\r\n\r\n- &euro;5 million for a second phase of ICT Skills Conversion courses. These were introduced earlier in 2012 as part of the joint industry-Government ICT Action Plan aimed at building the supply of high-level ICT graduates.\r\n\r\nHIGHER EDUCATION \r\n\r\nStudent contribution \r\n\r\nAs already signalled, the student contribution will rise by &euro;250 in 2013, 2014 &amp;amp; 2015 to a maximum of &euro;3,000.  This will raise &euro;18.5 million next year and &euro;37 million in 2014.  All students who are eligible for student grants will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf. At present two out of five students are in receipt of some form of student grant.  The rates of maintenance grants are being protected in this Budget.\r\n\r\nThere will be a 3% reduction in the income thresholds used when calculating entitlement to student grants in 2013.  Between 1997 and 2009, the income limits were increased by an average of 4.7% each year, in line with average industrial earnings.  However, the income limits over the past three years have remained unchanged, despite an estimated drop in the average industrial wage of approximately 7.9%.  The 3% reduction will be applied to the income thresholds for all students from September 2013 for the 2013\/2014 academic year.  It will see the threshold for the maximum standard rate of grant reduce from &euro;41,110 to &euro;39,875 and save &euro;2 million in 2013, rising to &euro;5 million in a full year. Approximately 8% of the total estimated 80,000 grant recipients will be affected by the measure.\r\n\r\nReduce allocation to higher education institutions (HEIs) in 2013\r\n\r\nSimilar to the measure applying to the VEC sector, next year the allocation to the HEIs will be reduced by &euro;25 million.  However, the institutions will be expected to deliver the same level of student services and manage this reduction through the use of existing cash reserves held by them.\r\n\r\nResourcing special projects\r\n\r\nThe Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, a key priority of the Government, continues to be rolled out and will cost approximately &euro;6.5 million in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe New Junior Cycle Framework, announced earlier this year, will be funded to the tune of &euro;3 million in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe roll-out of high speed broadband continues, with a further 200 schools expected to be connected by September 2013.  All second-level schools will receive high-speed broadband at no cost to themselves by Sept 2014.  \r\n\r\nThe Schools Building programme for 2013 will see work begin on 50 projects for new schools and major extensions.  This will bring the number of planned major school projects on site in 2013 to 113 as part of an overall capital expenditure on schools of almost &euro;370 million. \r\n\r\nPrevious Budget Measures impacting in 2013 \r\n\r\nCertain teacher allocation measures introduced in earlier Budgets will also impact on teacher numbers in 2013. These include the changes in Budget 2012 announced to the staffing schedules for smaller primary schools with up to 4 teachers. This change will have a target yield of some 75 posts in 2013. A further 125 posts will be yielded on foot of the Budget 2011 decision to reduce language support posts over a 4-year period.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1088,"content":"<p>Summary estimated position on Teacher numbers for 2013\/14 school yearPrimary sector \r\n\r\n(posts)Second level sector  (posts)Total postsTarget savings from Budget 2013 measure in fee-charging schools  0-100-100Target savings from previous budget measures (small schools and language support)-2000 -200Estimated additional posts to cater for increased demographics +650 +550 +1,200 Estimated Net change in overall number of posts +450 +450 +900\r\n\r\nWhen account is taken of additional posts for demographics at primary and second level (extra approximately 20,000 pupils) the net overall increase in teaching posts for the 2013\/14 school year compared to the current school year is estimated to be of the order of 900 posts, as shown in the above table. This represents an estimated net increase of about 1.4% on overall teacher numbers for the 2013\/14 school year compared to the current 2012\/13 school year.\r\n\r\nCapitation grants\r\n\r\nAs a result of school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, funding for capitation and related grants to schools in 2013 will be reduced by 0.5% for primary schools and by 2% for post-primary schools (in 2012 capitation payments were reduced for primary schools by 3.5% and by 2% for post-primary schools). The overall saving will be achieved by a reduction in the standard capitation rates only, and other related grant rates will remain unchanged. The new standard capitation rates will be &euro;176 for primary and &euro;306 for post-primary.\r\n\r\nCapitation rates in VTOS and PLC colleges are also being reduced by 2%, while HEIs will see reductions in core-pay and non pay funding of 2%.\r\n\r\nPerformance Budgeting &ndash; New Estimates Format \r\n\r\nThe Department&rsquo;s 2013 Estimate will reflect the new Performance Budgeting format that has been introduced for Government Departments. The change to the Performance Budgeting format is an important element of the Public Sector reform process and seeks to strengthen the focus that the annual Estimates will have on actual outputs and outcomes that Departments will deliver with public funds, based on the objectives and goals contained in the Departments&rsquo; Statement of Strategy. In addition to the high level expenditure information for the Education and Skills Vote published with today&rsquo;s Budget, more detailed information regarding the 2013 Estimate is being published on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1089,"content":"<p>2014 MAIN ESTIMATES FEATURES\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS\r\n\r\nDEIS schools\r\n\r\nSchools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) (DEIS) are protected in this Budget.  There have been no changes to DEIS Programme teacher allocation ratios or DEIS grants to schools as a result of this Budget.  \r\n\r\nSpecial Education \r\n\r\nPriority will continue to be accorded to special education. Funding for such provision of some &euro;1.3 billion is being maintained in 2014. This includes a further &euro;33 million to fund the education of children with special education needs in schools. The allocation for special needs represents in excess of 15% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training.\r\n\r\nBook Rental Schemes\r\n\r\nThe expenditure allocation will provide &euro;5 million to fund an overall 3 year investment of &euro;15 million to support the further extension of book rental schemes to cover all primary schools.  &euro;9 million of funding is being provided to support rollout in 2014 of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, while &euro;4.8 million will be provided for Junior Cycle reform. All second level schools will have high-speed broadband connectivity before the end of 2014. \r\n\r\nBUDGET MEASURES\r\n\r\nThe measures listed below will secure net current expenditure savings in 2014 of &euro;33 million. A further &euro;11 million will be secured by way of estimating savings across the Education and Skills Vote.\r\n\r\nHIGHER EDUCATION \r\n\r\nReduce allocation to higher education institutions (HEIs) in 2013\r\n\r\nIn Budget 2013 the funding allocation to the HEIs was reduced by &euro;25 million, with the institutions expected to manage this reduction and deliver the same level of student services through the use of existing cash reserves held by them. As a result of Budget 2014 this reduction of &euro;25 million will be continued for a further year, again taking account of the cash balances held by HEIs.\r\n\r\nFURTHER EDUCATION &amp;amp; TRAINING\r\n\r\nEnding concurrent payments to recipients of certain social protection payments who take up FAS and Youthreach courses.\r\n\r\nIn some instances participants on FAS training courses can retain social protection payments paid by the Department of Social Protection, as well as receiving their &euro;188 FAS and Youthreach training allowance. These concurrent payments, which are not payable to participants in Community Employment or VTOS schemes, are now being ended for new entrants to FAS and Youthreach training courses. This measure will yield &euro;5 million in savings in 2014.\r\n\r\nAbolition of &euro;20 long-term unemployment bonus paid to FAS, VTOS and Youthreach participants.\r\n\r\nThe payment of this allowance goes back to a time of full employment when there was a concern to incentivise the long-term unemployed to engage with labour market activation efforts. This payment will end for new entrants and will save &euro;2.1 million in 2014 and &euro;6.7 million in a full year. However, course participants will continue to receive meal and travel allowances.\r\n\r\nFAS apprentices to pay a pro-rata Student Contribution proportionate to the time they spend in Institutes of Technology\r\n\r\nApprentices attend IOTs for two ten-week periods during their four-year apprenticeships. The pro-rata student contribution (currently &euro;540) in respect of each period spent in the IOTs, paid up to now by the Exchequer, will from 2014 be paid by the apprentices themselves, yielding an annual Exchequer saving of &euro;1.6 million.\r\n\r\nAlignment of certain Further Education and Training Allowances\r\n\r\nChanges being introduced by the Department of Social Protection mean that new claimants of Jobseekers Allowance aged 25 years will from 2014 receive a reduced maximum payment of &euro;144 per week, increased to &euro;160 where a person participates in certain education and training programmes. To align social protection payments with payments made to participants in further education and training, such persons who enrol in VTOS, Youthreach and FAS training schemes will from 2014 also receive this &euro;160 rate.\r\n\r\nTEACHER NUMBERS\r\n\r\nProvision is made in the 2014 estimates for increases in teacher numbers due to demographics, as well as for increases in resource teacher numbers to maintain individual resource teacher allocations at existing levels. The table below shows the projected impact next year of these increases in numbers, net of reductions for the application of earlier budget measures. The net overall increase in teaching posts for the 2014\/15 school year compared to the current school year is estimated to be of the order of 1,395 posts, as shown in the above table. This represents an estimated net increase of about 2.2% on overall teacher numbers for the 2014\/15 school year compared to the current 2013\/14 school year.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1090,"content":"<p>Estimated position on Teacher numbers in schools for 2014\/15 school year-Primary sector (posts)Second level sector  (posts)Total postsTarget savings from previous budget measures (small schools and language support)-1550 -155Estimated additional posts to cater for increased demographics and provision for additional resource teachers +1,050 +500 +1,550 Estimated Net change in overall number of posts  +895 +500 +1,395<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1091,"content":"<p>PREVIOUS BUDGET MEASURES IMPACTING IN 2014\r\n\r\nThe allocation for 2014 also takes account of savings deriving from savings measures announced in previous Budgets.

These include the changes in Budget 2012 announced to the staffing schedules for smaller primary schools with up to 4 teachers. This change will have a target yield of approximately 75 posts in 2014. A further 80 primary posts will be yielded on foot of the Budget 2011 decision to reduce language support posts over a 4-year period.\r\n\r\nStudent contribution \r\n\r\nAs signalled in Budget 2013 the student contribution, at &euro;2,500 for the 2013\/14 academic year will rise by a further &euro;250 in each of the 2014\/15 and 2015\/16 academic years, to a maximum of &euro;3,000.  This will raise &euro;18.5 million next year and &euro;37 million in 2015.  All students who are eligible for student grants will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf.

The rates of maintenance grants are being protected in this Budget.\r\n\r\nCapitation grants\r\n\r\nOn foot of school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, funding for capitation and related grants to primary and post-primary schools in 2014 will be reduced by 1%. The overall saving will be achieved by a reduction in the standard capitation rates, with other related grant rates remaining unchanged. The new standard mainstream capitation rates in 2014 will be &euro;173 for primary and &euro;301 for post-primary.\r\n\r\nCapitation rates in Youthreach, VTOS and PLC colleges are also being reduced by 1%, while higher education institutions will see reductions in core-pay and non pay funding of 1%.\r\n\r\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION\r\n\r\nThe capital allocation of &euro;546 million will be principally deployed in the ongoing delivery of the Department&rsquo;s five year school building programme (2012 to 2016), which involves 275 major school building projects and an additional 80,000 school places to meet demographic demands.  The 2014 allocation also includes an additional &euro;65 million to meet the costs of projects announced under Government&rsquo;s stimulus initiatives of July 2012 and June 2013, including upfront enabling works for the development of the new DIT campus at Grangegorman and 28 additional school building projects.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1092,"content":"<p>2015 MAIN FEATURES<\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills - Main Estimate Features<\/p><p>The 2015 Estimate provides for the recruitment of approximately 900 extra mainstream teachers and 480 Resource Teachers in schools.

This is a change to the current arrangement whereby three months payments are made before end December and six months payments are made the following year, and takes account of requests to alleviate financial difficulties being experienced by students due to the fact that the academic year now starts earlier in many higher education institutions.\r\n\r\nPayments to the Higher Education Institutions in respect of the student contribution for those students receiving student grants will be paid in two instalments, in December 2015 and January 2016, rather than in a single instalment.  \r\n\r\nPREVIOUS BUDGET MEASURES IMPACTING IN 2015\r\n\r\nThe allocation for 2015 also takes account of savings deriving from measures announced in previous Budgets which will be implemented in 2015. These measures are summarised below.\r\n\r\nStudent contribution in higher education\r\n\r\nA final &euro;250 increase in the student contribution, arising from a decision in Budget 2013, will bring the amount of the contribution to &euro;3,000 for the 2015\/16 academic year.  This measure will secure net savings of &euro;17 million in 2016.  All students eligible for student grants will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf. Currently over 50% of under-graduates are in receipt of some form of student grant.  The rates of maintenance grants are being protected in this Budget.\r\n\r\nCapitation grants\r\n\r\nA final 1% reduction in capitation and related grants to primary and post-primary schools, under a measure announced in Budget 2012, will take place in 2015 and will yield savings of approximately &euro;3 million, achieved by a reduction in the standard capitation rates, with other related grant rates remaining unchanged. The new standard mainstream capitation rates in 2015 will be &euro;170 (from &euro;173) for primary and &euro;296 (from &euro;301) for post-primary.  This reduction, however, will be offset by an additional allocation of approximately &euro;5 million to provide for increased pupil numbers in schools.\r\n\r\nCapitation rates in Youthreach, VTOS and PLC colleges are also being reduced by a final 1% in 2015 (yield &euro;1 million), while core pay and non-pay funding grants to higher education institutions will also be reduced by a final 1%, yielding &euro;11 million.\r\n\r\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION\r\n\r\nThe capital allocation of &euro;530 million will be principally deployed on the school sector (&euro;450m), Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects (&euro;18m) and on Higher Education projects (&euro;55m).\r\n\r\nThe focus in the school sector continues to be the provision of additional permanent places to meet the demographic need at both primary and post-primary levels.  Later this year the 2015 Large Scale Projects Programme will be announced and these projects will be primed to advance to tender and construction throughout 2015. The announcement will also include details of the projects on the 2013 and 2014 programmes that are on site. It is expected that over 50 large scale projects will reach substantial completion in 2015.\r\n\r\nSchool places are not only delivered by the completion of Large Scale School Projects but also under the devolved Additional Accommodation Scheme. Other expenditure items in 2015 will include acquiring sites for school buildings, the emergency works scheme, the 2014 Summer Works Scheme, funding furniture and equipment requests and other smaller commitments.\r\n\r\nMost of the PPP allocation is in respect of Unitary Charges associated with Bundle 3 Schools.\r\n\r\nExpenditure on the Higher Education sector will feature the completion of the St Patrick&rsquo;s Teacher Training College, Drumcondra and on-going development works at DIT Grangegorman as well as the commencement of the Human Biology Building at NUI Galway, an extension to the library at Limerick University, construction of the Confucius Institute at UCD and an infrastructure fund for the institute of technology sector.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Expenditure","counter":1095,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000084#WRX02688"},{"type":"question","counter":1096,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[10567\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000084#WRX02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to outline the savings her Department made by adjusting the adjacent rates for qualifying for higher education grants for each year since the changes were introduced.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1097,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures, which came into effect for the 2011\/12, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres.<\/p>  <p>  The 24 km distance criterion was originally set in 1968.

My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which involves taking the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment, in particular without risk to water. <\/p>  <p>  The responsibility for the investigation of catchment-based water quality issues in this area lies with the local authorities and the responsibility for ensuring safe drinking water lies with Irish Water: both are supervised in these roles by the EPA.  On noting the recent reports related to the River Fane, the EPA requested information from the local authorities involved, Louth and Monaghan County Councils. Both authorities have conducted inquiries into this matter with some operational support provided by the EPA. <\/p>  <p>  The EPA also immediately initiated communication with Irish Water in relation to this matter.  Irish Water has informed the EPA that they have carried out monitoring and it has not found PAHs in the River Fane abstraction point for the Dundalk supply. In addition, the EPA conducted an audit of the Dundalk drinking water plant on 5 February.  The initial findings were discussed with Irish Water on that day, and I understand that a report will be issued shortly.  The EPA is also in contact with cross-border authorities in relation to this matter and will remain in communication with the relevant authorities until it is brought to a satisfactory close.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There is a culture of strong and active co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies.  My own Department, as part of on-going cooperation on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are on-going.<\/p>  <p>  There are well established structures in existence that provide a forum to deal with a variety of cross border issues, including waste arising from fuel laundering activities.  As indicated previously, I have written to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight again the problems being faced by border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime and I have signalled to him that this is an issue that I will be raising at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in May.  The council meets in the Environment Sector in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in a cross-border context in areas such as environmental protection, pollution, water quality management and waste management and this is, I believe, the most appropriate forum to address this serious issue from a waste and water quality perspective. <\/p>  <p>  The illegal deposition of waste material arising from diesel laundering activities presents the local authorities with major difficulties as the task of cleaning up the material needs to be dealt with to avoid threats to the environment.  The laundering process requires the use of chemicals such as sulphuric acid and bleaching agents and results in a waste by-product, a tar-like chemical compound or sludge, with significant potential for environmental pollution, particularly in relation to watercourses. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions and these engagements will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000085#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":1122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000085#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1123,"qnumday":511,"qnumall":"[9999\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000085#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of houses built by Wexford County Council, including former town councils, for each year from 1970 until 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1124,"content":"<p>My Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing <b>statistics<\/b>that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy.

As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will over time result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. <\/p>  <p>  A further important rationale for the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  The performance of different functions by members at county and municipal district levels will result in greater effectiveness than the previous parallel town and county system, which involved a significant element of duplication.  The division of functions between county and district has been determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level. Local matters are to be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are being decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind in relation to the new sub-county governance arrangements that we are in the very early stages of reform. Municipal districts only came into operation on 1 June 2014 and 2015 will be the first full year of their operation.  Against this background, I intend to have an evaluation process undertaken on the operation of the new structures through a broadly based advisory group which my Department is reconvening together with a working group for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government, both of which played an important role in the early stages of the local government reform process.

This amount is based on the number of houses for which Subsidy A was recouped to local authorities in 2014\u00a0qualifying for the full new subsidy amounts in 2015. However, this amount is likely to vary as some houses may not qualify, on the basis of incurred expenditure, for the full subsidy amount. In addition, the number of schemes applying for subsidy may vary from year to year.<\/p>  <p>  To promote sustainable use of water and to enhance water conservation in households, the Department of Social Protection will administer, on behalf of my Department, a &euro;100 water conservation grant for households (primary dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process.

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil.<\/p>  <p>  The value of a gas field will depend on a combination of factors including the volume of recoverable gas, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production. As such it would be a speculative exercise to provide a total estimated value of commercial gas discoveries off the Irish coast.<\/p>  <p>  Profits from the three producing gas fields are taxed at a corporation rate of 25% (double the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income).  In addition, royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  The combination of tax, royalties and acreage rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.<\/p>  <p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987 (following the lead of the UK and Norway who abolished royalties for new fields in 1982 and 1986 respectively).<\/p>  <p>  The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field, which is expected to come into production in 2015, will be through acreage rental fees and the 25% corporation tax on profits.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by international energy consultants Wood Mackenzie.

If service providers are prohibited from recovering those wholesale costs directly from retail users, it is inevitable they will seek to recover the costs from other users or reduce volume limits in bundled minutes and data package limits, in order to control costs.  These outcomes do not serve the long term interests of consumers.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council has been discussing the roaming proposals for several months now and at a recent meeting Ireland along with all Member States agreed to give the Latvian Presidency a mandate to enter into negotiations with the European Parliament on a revised set of proposals on roaming charges across the EU.  This will significantly reduce regulated roaming charges further when agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000088#WRBB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":1265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000088#WRBB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1266,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[10558\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000088#WRBB02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"noting the New Scientist report in January 2015 on the dangers arising from 60 years of nuclear waste at Sellafield, the risks of explosions, serious pollution and risks to public health in Britain and Ireland; if he accepts that his proposed consideration of a nuclear power contribution to Irish energy is at best misguided and if he will instead provide the leadership necessary to utilise the expertise of the  engineers in the Electricity Supply Board and elsewhere as may be necessary to prioritise the development of wave energy conversion, offshore wind, a renewable energy suitable grid and interconnectors to provide Ireland's energy needs, export renewable energy and provide jobs.","asker":"1192","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1267,"content":"<p>The May 2014 Green Paper on Energy Policy covers a broad range of energy issues, including an exploration of all possible fuel options, for securing a balanced, sustainable and secure energy mix.  It would not be appropriate to exclude any fuel option from such a broad policy consultation and engagement process.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the use of nuclear fission for the generation of nuclear power is statutorily prohibited by (i) the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006 which prohibits the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission, and (ii) the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, which makes similar prohibitive provision in respect of regulatory authorisations. There are no plans to bring forward any proposals to amend the existing statutory provisions.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport.  To date onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.<\/p>  <p>  Irish energy policy also recognises the potential to diversify our renewable electricity generation portfolio in the period to 2020 and beyond.  To that end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, published in February last year, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources.  Furthermore the Draft Bioenergy Plan published in October 2014, acknowledges the role that the bioenergy sector can play in the transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced energy connectivity has the potential to help energy consumers benefit from a fully integrated European Internal Energy Market, as well as increasing the contribution that renewable energy can make to meeting our energy requirements.  In this regard, I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s Energy Union package adopted on 25 February, which included the Communication on achieving greater electricity interconnection of all Member States.  The completion of the North South Transmission Line project and additional possible interconnections with both the UK and France would enhance our electricity interconnectivity and bring significant benefits in terms of energy security, competitiveness and sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000088#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":1268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000088#WRBB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1269,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[10573\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000088#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the action being taken to provide an adequate broadband service to the town of Kilrush, County Clare, and the surrounding area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1270,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.

The first meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the 1916 Commemorations, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, took place on 3<sup><\/sup>February 2015 and meets for the second time today, 10 March.  <\/p><p>Meetings have also taken place with other key Departments, agencies, local authorities and interested parties.  My Department's 2016 Project Office is engaging with the National Cultural Institutions, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland and the Heritage Council to ensure that a comprehensive and diverse cultural programme is developed.  Meetings and a dedicated workshop have also been held with a wide range of Irish language groups in order to develop an Irish language programme.  My Department has been working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to develop an appropriate programme involving the Irish Diaspora and with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure the involvement of primary and post-primary schools and the third-level education sector.  My Department has also been engaging with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the views of children are taken on board and that they have a meaningful contribution to make.<\/p><p>The relatives of those who fought and those who died during the Rising will play a key role in the <i>Ireland 2016<\/i>programme and I am actively engaging with them to ensure that will have a central involvement in a number of key State events and that their views on the overall programme are considered.  My officials and I have met with a number of relatives, including representatives of relatives&rsquo; groups and individual relatives, to highlight the important role that they will have in the plans to commemorate the centenary of the events of Easter 1916.  <\/p><p>My Department is also working closely with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Department of Defence to ensure that a full programme of State commemorative events is developed, which is respectful to all those were affected by the events of the Rising.<\/p><p>In addition to this, my Department continues to engage with members of the public on their ideas for 2016. Over one hundred proposals have been received in the 2016 Project Office to date from members of the public and interested parties - via email, postal submissions and through the project website, - and I very much appreciate and welcome all ideas and submissions received.<\/p><p>I look forward to continuing engagement with all stakeholders and members of the public as the <i>Ireland 2016<\/i>initiative develops.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000092#WRFF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000092#WRFF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[10118\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000092#WRFF01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide &euro;7,675 in funding for a First World War memorial at the Market House, Ballybay, County Monaghan, for which funding has been requested by the Ballybay World War I committee; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"972","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>I am awaiting a formal submission from the Committee referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000092#WRFF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[10189\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000092#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n l&iacute;on de na fostaithe at&aacute; fostaithe sa mhonarcha toit&iacute;n&iacute; leictreonacha i gCorr na M&oacute;na gur cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge iad &oacute;n nGaeltacht; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1448,"content":"<p>Tuigim &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta go bhfuil coinn&iacute;ollacha saini&uacute;la maidir le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Chomhaont&uacute; Deontais leis an gcomhlacht a bhfuil tagairt d&eacute;anta d&oacute; ag an Teachta.
