There are a number of models for using land for greenways only one of which is CPO.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the various models used to deliver individual projects, it is a matter for the County Council in charge of delivering a specific project to consider access to land on a case by case basis and take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  In the event of a proposed route traversing private land there are a number of options that can be considered by the authority, the first being the permissive access model.  This is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level.  It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners.\u00a0 Indeed, the most well-known Greenway in the country, the Great Western Greenway from Westport to Achill, has been built using the permissive access model.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial agreements or, if required, CPO, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided on.  There is no one size fits all approach to this.<\/p>  <p>  As stated above, negotiated permissive access from the perspectives of cost and public ownership has value but, for projects of national scale, such as the Dublin to Galway greenway, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO.  In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land and involve major state investment, it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07300"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[9472\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide details of all properties rented by his Department; the annual cost of the leases; the duration of the leases; and the capacity, and occupancy, of each premises, as at the end of January 2015.","asker":"1058","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>The properties occupied by my Department, including the bodies under its aegis, are provided by the Office of Public Works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Data","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA08200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[10165\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000062#WRA08300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the current rate of unemployment in County Clare; the rate of unemployment in County Clare, over the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.

Information providers support their clients to act on their own behalf wherever possible (self-advocacy). They also advocate directly on behalf of their clients through contacting and negotiating with third parties or attending meetings, hearings or appeals.<\/p><p>In 2014, the nationwide network of CISs was allocated funding of some &euro;12.5 million from CIB&rsquo;s overall budget allocation of &euro;46 million.

Funding of &euro;3.07 million was made available to NAS in 2014 from the CIB.<\/p><p>During 2014, NAS provided an advocacy service to some 1,012 people.  This number includes over 340 new cases.  Overall, 28% of advocacy cases related to housing issues, 19% related to health issues, 13% related to social welfare and 11% to justice issues, while a further 7% related to court cases regarding children.

For many lone parents, most of whom are women, this has meant long-term social welfare dependency, associated poverty and social exclusion for them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely. These reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to access the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment programmes, to develop their skills set and, ultimately, to secure employment and financial independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[9892\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000065#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding mortgage interest rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>At the outset, I must confirm to the Deputy that\u00a0the lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a shareholding -\u00a0are independent commercial entities.\u00a0I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or\u00a0in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.\u00a0 It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. \u00a0The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty\u00a0or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated in\u00a0previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated\u00a0that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Patrick Honohan in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0last November\u00a0stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.

I am retaining the child ceiling of &euro;500 for those aged 18 to 20 that are continuing to avail of insurance at the child premium rates.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have agreed to operate the changes on an administrative basis pending the provision of the underpinning legislation as part of the next Finance Bill. Therefore, the changes will be effective for all policies purchased or renewed (or which come into effect) on or after 1 May 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The current regime for\u00a0tax relief on medical insurance premiums\u00a0provides a maximum tax relief\u00a0ceiling\u00a0of &euro;500 in respect of\u00a0a child, which is defined as an individual under the age of 18 years or, if over 18 years of age and under\u00a023 years of age, who is receiving full-time education and in respect of whom a child premium is paid.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is not compulsory for insurers to offer child premium rates to young adults under the current system and it will not be compulsory for them to offer reduced premiums under the new system.  Therefore, where a full adult premium is payable, the full adult ceiling for tax relief of &euro;1,000 has always been available and this will continue to be the case.  It should be further noted that the maximum tax relief is available at the rate of 20% of the premium payable or &euro;200, whichever is lower.  Thus, where a reduced premium is being availed of, the full adult ceiling for relief may not be employed depending on the premium price.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners\u00a0tentatively estimate that the cost of extending the full &euro;1,000 adult ceiling for private medical insurance tax relief to all persons aged 21 or over, would be\u00a0approximately &euro;1 million. <\/p>  <p>  This provisional estimate is based on returns to Revenue for the year 2013 (the most recent year for which data is available) and does not take account of any changes in the level of medical insurance coverage or premium rates in the interim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Collection","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[10133\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding local property tax in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a key aspect of the work undertaken in regard to Local Property Tax (LPT) was the development of a comprehensive property register of residential properties in the State.

This is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse.  Any delay in the collection of tax that is properly due adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue assures me that its strong preference is to work with viable businesses or taxpayers suffering temporary cashflow difficulties to agree a mutually acceptable solution rather than deploying debt collection\/enforcement options.  Revenues commitment in this regard is clearly evidenced by the fact that it granted almost 9,000 phased payment arrangements in respect of over &euro;120m of debt during 2014 rather than using debt collection\/enforcement action to secure the liabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  Where debt collection\/enforcement action becomes necessary to secure an outstanding debt, the Revenue caseworker firstly writes to the defaulting business or taxpayer demanding that the liability be paid within a specified timeframe, which is normally seven days.  The  final demand letter also clearly warns that the consequence of continued non-compliance is referral of the debt to enforcement.  Revenues first line debt collection\/enforcement options for the majority of cases are Sheriff and Solicitor action and when a case is referred, responsibility for any future negotiation is delegated to the collection agent.  <\/p>  <p>  Once a case is referred for debt collection\/enforcement, the Sheriff or Solicitor writes to the taxpayer or business offering a final opportunity to agree a mutually acceptable solution.  Where no solution can be agreed, the Sheriff or Solicitor then seeks to collect the outstanding amounts, including costs, in accordance with the various legal powers available to them. <\/p>  <p>  Solicitor (Court) action is used to secure judgment against a defaulting business or taxpayer.  The judgment, which confirms the debt before the Courts, can be made public and can also be used by Revenue to place judgment mortgages against any property (owned by the business or taxpayer) to the value of the outstanding debt.  Judgments are also used as part of the proceedings associated with Bankruptcy, Forced Sale of property and committal to prison, though Revenue only applies such sanctions in the most egregious or intransigent cases. In all cases where judgment is sought, the business or taxpayer is notified by way of Court summons.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally in regard to notification of judgment mortgages, Revenue has confirmed to me that it is the responsibility of the Property Registration Authority to inform the business or taxpayer that such a charge has been put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Collection","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[10285\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding property tax in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the person to whom the Question refers paid his 2014 Local Property Tax (LPT) by Single Debit Authority (SDA) rather than by Direct Debit.<\/p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, the SDA option facilitates a single deduction from a current account (like an electronic cheque) and does not carry over from year to year in the way that Annual Debit Authorities, Direct Debits and Deductions at Source from salaries\/pensions do. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue also confirmed to me that a member of the LPT team has already made direct contact with the person and explained the various payment options to him.

This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs (or vested PRSAs).<\/p>  <p>  As regards the changes to AMRF access, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements (the so-called  ARF option), where an individual in a Defined Contribution pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum set aside amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with the &euro;63,500.<\/p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owners discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements).<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension nest-egg to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement.  Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation.  While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.<\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF.  This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.<\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years.  In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.<\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75.  This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a draw down of a lesser value than will now be permitted.  I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE02950"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[10351\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000066#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 15 November 2011, in which he stated that at no point were Irish pounds being printed or was consideration being given to printing them, if that was in fact the case, in view of comments made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (details supplied); if he will provide, in detail, the contingency plans referred to by that Minister; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>My response to Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 15 November 2011 was accurate, at no point in 2011 (or since) were Irish pounds being printed.

Based on the details supplied by you, it would appear that the couple concerned have benefitted by approximately &euro;13 per week from the Budget tax measures. The Deputy will be aware that a cap of &euro;14 per week\u00a0was implemented as part of the Budget package to ensure that those with incomes in excess of &euro;70,000 did not benefit more than those with incomes at that level.  However, when\u00a0increases in the level\u00a0of Child Benefit introduced in the Budget\u00a0are taken into account, the couple concerned are benefitting by around &euro;15 per week. <\/p>  <p>  The Government\u00a0targeted its Budget package at the\u00a0\"squeezed middle\", i.e. those earning between &euro;32,000 and &euro;70,000 per annum.  While I am sympathetic to all those facing financial difficulties, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that over 87% of tax cases will have income of &euro;70,000 or less in 2015.  Therefore, it would be difficult to categorise households which have income in excess of &euro;70,000 as being in a \"middle income\" bracket. <\/p>  <p>  All married one-earner couples with sufficient income are benefitting from the increase in the standard rate band by &euro;1,000 from &euro;41,800 to &euro;42,800\u00a0in Budget 2015.  These couples also benefit from the cuts to the higher rate of income tax in the Budget, and from a reduction in USC if their income is under &euro;87,500.  The reason married one earners don't benefit as much from the income tax cuts, as a single individual or a married two-earner couple,\u00a0is because they\u00a0already pay much less income tax because of the transferable standard rate band.  For example, a married one earner on &euro;55,000 who has children will pay 55% less income tax than a single individual on the same income, in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The system of individualisation, which has been in the tax code since 1999,\u00a0is now integral to the tax system.  When first announced, the stated purpose of individualisation was essentially, to ease the burden on single persons (65% of the work force), to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  At the same time, a home carer allowance was introduced to compensate those who chose to stay at home to care for children rather than participate in the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system, with the standard rate band partially transferable between spouses, &euro;9,000 being the gap between the single and married one-earner bands.<\/p>  <p>  To complete or to reverse individualisation would cost in the region of &euro;800 million.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that no change be made to the current system. It concluded that the current system represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that that reversal of individualisation would see a second spouse entering the workforce, being liable to\u00a0the marginal rate of tax on the first euro of income.

A commercial practice may also be misleading if the trader omits or conceals information necessary for an informed consumer decision and if that omission or concealment would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing or other decision that he or she would not otherwise make.<\/p>  <p>  An advertiser who publishes an advertisement which contravenes the Act does not commit an offence, however, if the advertiser proves that he or she did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that its publication would be in contravention of the Act.  In order to assist enforcement of the Act&rsquo;s provisions on misleading advertising, an advertiser who accepts or agrees to publish an advertisement is required to make a record of the name and address of a trader who places an advertisement, and to keep that record for not less than two years from the date of its publication.<\/p>  <p>  Advertisements in print and other media that are directed at businesses are regulated by the European Communities (Misleading and Comparative Marketing Communications) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 774 of 2007) which give effect to Directive 2006\/114\/EC on Misleading and Comparative advertising.  The Regulations provide that a marketing communication is misleading if, in any way (including its presentation), it deceives or is likely to deceive in relation to any matter specified in the Regulations the trader to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches, and by reason of its deceptive nature, it is likely to affect the trader's economic behaviour or to injure or be likely to injure a competitor.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these legislative provisions, advertisements in print and other media come within the system of self-regulation established and administered by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.  The Authority&rsquo;s Code of Standards for Advertising, Promotional and Direct Marketing requires advertising and other marketing communications to be 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'.  Members of the Authority are required to abide by the Code and not to publish an advertisement that contravenes it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000068#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Competition and Consumer Protection Commission","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000068#WRG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[10387\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000068#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is satisfied with the operation of proposals, to end unfair practices in the retail sector to date; if he has studied the proposals by the European Union Commissioner for Agriculture to impose fines of up to 1% of retail turnover for unfair practices which impact upon producers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>I am aware of recent media coverage in which Commissioner Hogan was reported as having indicated his intention to bring forward proposals before the end of this year to address certain issues in the relationships between retailers and producers.

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.<\/p>  <p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe met the objectives to the greatest extent possible.

My Department monitors these official figures for employment in the sector as a matter of course.  I especially noted the statement therein, to which the Deputy refers, that employment in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries dropped by 10,900 or 9.3% since Q4 2013. I would caution, however, that these figures should be viewed in the context of the following caveat provided by the CSO, the first paragraph of which is included in the release itself:<\/p>  <p>  After each Census of Population the sample of households for the QNHS is updated to ensure the sample remains representative.  The new sample based on the 2011 Census of Population was introduced incrementally from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013.  This change in sample can lead to some level of variability in estimates, particularly at more detailed levels and some caution is warranted in the interpretation of trends over the period of its introduction.  The first year on year comparisons for quarters based entirely on the new sample are therefore available as of Q4 2014.<\/p>  <p>  However, as the QNHS is a sample survey, there is a level of variance associated with the estimates produced from the QNHS. In the case of the Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector it can be noted that the CSO estimates that the standard error measure associated with employment in this sector was 4,800 in Q4 2014 and this should be borne in mind when considering the employment levels for this sector.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the estimate for Q4 2013 was particularly high, again likely due to sampling issues, which further skews this particular year-on-year comparison.<\/p>  <p>  We have been in regular contact with the CSO over recent years, and will continue to be so, in an effort to gain greater insight into the figures for employment in the sector. The CSO recently indicated that they intend to revisit the data published since the 2011 Census of Population with a view to producing revised figures for this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000070#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Fisheries Policy","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000070#WRJ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[10343\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000070#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to adopt the operational plan to give effect to the Common Fisheries Policy 2014-2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the operational programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Regulation (508\/2014) which is the financial regulation for the Common Fisheries Policy. <\/p>  <p> I will be launching later this year a new &euro;241 million Seafood Development Programme for the period up to 2020 under the EMFF.
