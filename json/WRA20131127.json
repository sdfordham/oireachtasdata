In Pratt and Whitney&rsquo;s case, a decision was taken by the parent company to transfer dwindling customer requirements to a site in the US. This has resulted in the phasing out of older technologies and products. However, the company still has excess capacity across its engineering\/maintenance\/repair operations.  Indeed 4 other such sites had already been closed by the company.  This is the key determinant in their decision to initiate a process which is likely to cease production at the Rathcoole plant and to introduce a redundancy programme there, on a phased basis, over the next eighteen months. 107 jobs will be impacted by the programme.<\/p><p>  IDA have engaged regularly with the company over recent years in order to assist them address the challenges they faced in a very fast-changing and competitive marketplace. This involved advice and support towards addressing issues that arose for the company from time to time.  IDA arranged that the company became involved in a wider grouping of International Engineering companies, based in Ireland, which IDA established, in order to benefit from shared experiences and facilitate capacity building.  In addition IDA met with senior management for Pratt and Whitney in the USA in October 2013 and, also, they have held ongoing engagement with the wider parent group, United Technologies, in the USA .<\/p><p>  In the case of Lufthansa, the decision to enter into a consultation process with the workers was taken following an extensive review of operations, in the context of declining revenues and shrinking international market opportunities.  The company has pointed out that enhanced quality and efficiencies of the new generations of aircraft engines &ndash; with reduced need for overhaul &ndash; has impacted on their business with fewer engines becoming available for service.  There are also complex changes in the dynamics of aircraft maintenance, including engine refurbishment, worldwide, which have knock-on impacts in facilities such as those in Ireland.  As you will appreciate, the ultimate decision in these cases is made by the parent company, on strictly commercial grounds, and on what is seen by the company as being in the best interests of the group as a whole. <\/p><p>  I have met senior executives of the company on three occasions since taking office and IDA have been engaged with them very frequently over recent years in an effort to find solutions to the difficult business environment they face. The IDA arranged the intervention of the State&rsquo;s Industrial Relations service at a time of Industrial Relations difficulties and considerable progress was achieved on that issue at the time.  IDA also approved a training grant to train the production workers on a new engine type which enabled the company to take on new business. As various other issues arose there was regular contact between the IDA and company management to provide advice and information. However the current challenges are very significant.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has met with company management in both cases with a view to creating a profile of the Rathcoole plants, and of the workforces and their skills, for marketing purposes by IDA&rsquo;s global team.  IDA will remain in on-going contact with the companies during the next 12-18 months.  In addition, I have arranged that Enterprise Ireland will engage with the company to explore whatever other options might be possible, taking into account that Agency&rsquo;s remit and experience in supporting the Irish-owned engineering sector.   <\/p><p>  I am conscious of the highly-skilled workforces at both companies and have asked IDA to explore the possibility of securing a takeover or buy-out for either company.  I want to assure the House that all that can be done by the State&rsquo;s agencies in an effort to secure a positive result for the employees at both companies is being done and will continue to be done, including any appropriate upskilling of the employees affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Question No. 13 answered with Question No. 11.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[48807\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to expand market access in the United States of America.","asker":"992","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>One of the key means to expanding market access in the US will be the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

Now that the negotiations are underway, we will fully play our part in supporting the EU Commission in getting the best deal possible for Ireland and the EU.  <\/p><p>  The mandate on the EU side is a broad ranging one, covering virtually all sectors of economic interest.

As far as EI clients are concerned, the approval of a number of new drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013 is expected to provide limited opportunity for the indigenous pharmaceutical companies in the short term.  The indigenous pharmaceutical manufacturing companies are mainly focussed on over the counter and generic pharmaceutical products and sold mainly in the UK and Europe.  Those companies have access to all the full suite of state supports available to indigenous industry.  If any opportunities arise for indigenous pharmaceutical companies, Enterprise Ireland will bring all its supports to bear in support of such opportunities. Enterprise Ireland continues to work closely with IDA Ireland to link indigenous companies with their FDI counterparts and this may generate some opportunities in support, services and sub contract manufacturing.  <\/p><p>  IDA are seeing some positive investment trends from existing and new clients concerning the manufacture of newly approved drugs in Ireland. Many of these new drugs are low volume and can be accommodated in existing Irish sites.  However many of the newly approved drugs are biotech drugs and may well require greenfield, expansion investments and new job creation in bio-manufacturing.<\/p><p>  Central to the continued success of Irish companies internationally has been their R&amp;amp;D capabilities, leadership and management strengths and collaborative partnerships with some of the world&rsquo;s leading companies in the sector. The indigenous company base has extensive capabilities across the pharmaceutical and biotechnology supply chain including drug discovery, development and drug delivery; the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the manufacture of human and veterinary finished products; the provision of pharma services, including clinical trials management, regulation, engineering and construction.   <\/p><p>  The indigenous bio-pharmachemical sector plays a key role in this ecosystem and consists of approximately 100 Enterprise Ireland client companies. This sector has been growing at an average of 14% per annum over the last four years. In 2012, the sector had exports of over &euro;450M, and employment of over 2,500 people. The indigenous sector is highly innovative and dynamic with companies competing successfully in international markets throughout the world e.g. Sigmoid, Opsona, Alimentary Health, ICON, Chanelle, TopChem, Barclays, Eirgen, Arran Chemicals etc. <\/p><p>  The State has invested heavily through Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in the development of a World-class Research Infrastructure by funding industry-academic research collaborations, Industry-led research programmes, Technology Centres and the Technology Gateways Programmes through the likes of the National Institute for Bioprocess Research and Training (NIBRT), the Solid State Pharmaceutics cluster and the Pharma Technology Centre. These centres aim to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the Irish biopharma industry by investing in research on next generation manufacturing processes and training &amp;amp; education of people to work in this industry.<\/p><p>  A key focus for Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and other relevant stakeholder bodies is to promote and build expertise in &lsquo;biological&rsquo; research, development and manufacture such that Ireland continues to develop as a globally recognised &lsquo;biopharmaceutical hub&rsquo;. The NIBRT facility has been effective in bringing training on large molecule manufacturing processes to the sector in Ireland that has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, Biomarin and Pfizer, as examples.  Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland, through its overseas network, remains committed to maintaining and growing relationships with key decision makers in the pharmaceutical industry and can offer a wide variety of assistance to companies to support new investment and uplift in technical capability of existing clients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[50549\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the potential benefits and risks for Ireland from the Mercosur trade talks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>The EU-Mercosur trade negotiations take place in the context of the EU&rsquo;s common commercial policy.

Shortly after entering office, I committed to a fundamental reform of the workplace relations system. The overall objectives are to promote harmonious and productive employment relationships and to encourage early resolution of disputes, the vindication of employees&rsquo; rights and minimisation of the costs involved for all parties - employers, employees and Government - in terms of money, time and workplace productivity. <\/p><p>  I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure which will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill. Enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary acts, 12 specified parts or sections of acts and 71 statutory instruments.  My Department has been engaging with the AG's Office on an on-going basis to progress the drafting of the Bill and I am committed to the publication and enactment of the legislation at an early stage with a view to having the proposed new Workplace Relations structures in place during 2014.<\/p><p>  In addition to the progression of the enabling legislation, much work has already been completed or is underway in relation to the enhancement of efficiency, effectiveness, business processes and technology, within the bodies concerned.  This Government has also introduced a wide range of measures to establish and protect the employment rights of workers and to provide the policy, legislative and institutional framework within which good industrial relations prosper. <\/p><p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, which commenced on 1 August 2012, provides for a radical overhaul of the statutory wage setting mechanisms and reinstates a robust system of protection for low paid and vulnerable workers in the aftermath of the 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.  The 2012 Act provided for reviews of each Joint Labour Committee (JLC) to be carried out by the Labour Court. On 1 October, 2013, I published the Labour Court Report.  I have accepted the recommendations contained in the Report and the Ministerial Orders to effect the recommendations are currently being drafted and I hope to be in a position to sign them shortly. <\/p><p>  In May 2013, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the framework for Registered Employment Agreements. This is clearly an important issue for many employers and their employees, particularly in relation to rates of pay and tendering for contracts and I intend to bring forward legislation to address the ruling as soon as possible.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the current law on employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining, so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. Discussions with stakeholders on the issue are on-going and I hope to be in a position to put proposals to Cabinet shortly. <\/p><p>  This Government decision in 2011 to reverse the &euro;1 per hour reduction in the National Minimum Wage introduced by the previous Government represents a significant commitment to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.  The Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012, provides that equal treatment in terms of basic working and employment conditions must be applied to temporary agency workers in the same way as if they were directly recruited by the hirer to the same or similar job.   <\/p><p>  Migrant workers are a vulnerable class of people and careful consideration is given to the potential for abuse and many of the criteria in evaluating employment permits applications focus on the bona-fides of the employer and the protection of the employee.  This feature of the employment permits regime will be preserved in the draft Employment Permits Bill which I envisage submitting to Government for approval at the earliest opportunity.  The Bill as drafted will also provide, subject to Government approval, for amending legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee, following the result of the High Court Judgement of 31st August 2012 concerning Mr. Younis.<\/p><p>  The introduction of these measures demonstrates this Government's commitment to deliver modern, user friendly and world class workplace relations services and to ensure optimum protection for the employment rights of workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[50562\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700058#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on whether the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership might affect Ireland's sovereignty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include:<\/p><p>  - In Company Law, savings of &euro;82 million per annum have already been realised, more than &euro;33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts. <\/p><p>  - In Health &amp;amp; Safety Law, a total of &euro;124 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (&euro;60m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (&euro;64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.<\/p><p>  - In Employment Law, savings of &euro;1.2 million were realised by simplifying online procedures and forms. <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that reducing the administration burden on taxpayers and making it as easy as possible for them to be compliant is one of their key corporate objectives.  In recent years the Revenue Commissioners have also reduced the administrative burden on business by 25% through a number of initiatives, saving the business community over &euro;85 million per year.  I am also advised that in the Revenue Statement of Strategy 2011-2014, one of its core strategic priorities is to make it easier and less costly for taxpayers to comply and Revenue is constantly looking for opportunities to drive down compliance costs for business.<\/p><p>  The success of strategies is borne out to some extent when comparing this country against other jurisdictions.  One such benchmark study is the World Bank\/PWC Report &ldquo;Ease of Paying Taxes 2014&rdquo;.  In this study, out of 189 countries, Ireland ranks in 6th place and 1st in the EU.  The level of voluntary compliance is also a valid indicator of the effectiveness of a tax administration.  Revenue&rsquo;s strategies include consulting with stakeholders, reducing complexity and providing good quality services to make it as easy as possible to comply.  This approach, as evidenced by the table below, has resulted in very high levels of compliance.<table><tr><th>Tax<\/th><th>2012  <\/th><th>2011<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>PAYE\/PRSI<\/td><td>95%<\/td><td>95%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VAT<\/td><td>91%<\/td><td>91%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Preliminary Income Tax (Non PAYE)<\/td><td>98%<\/td><td>97%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capital Gains Tax<\/td><td>94%<\/td><td>91%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Corporation Tax<\/td><td>98%<\/td><td>91%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Relevant Contracts Tax<\/td><td>86%<\/td><td>85%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  We also need to continue to listen to business, especially SMEs and micro-enterprises, and find out where regulation is most burdensome.

It has been responsible for a number of key product launches in its area.<\/p><p>  In relation to Alkermes Athlone, reductions of approximately 100 to 130 staff, from a workforce of 420, were announced earlier this year, to take place over a two-year period as older product lines are phased out.  This process is on-going through a combination of natural attrition, voluntary redundancy and compulsory redundancy.  The Athlone facility will continue to play a strategic part in Alkermes&rsquo; future business, and significant investment is planned to be made at the site over the next number of years which will allow Alkermes to focus primarily on the manufacture of newer, advanced pharmaceutical product lines.  World-class development and manufacturing activities at the plant will remain robust and it will continue producing global pharmaceutical products.      <\/p><p>  It is very unfortunate that these redundancies had to be initiated but you will appreciate that the Pharma sector is going through significant challenges worldwide and parent companies need to make strategic decisions for their future, which can involve reducing job numbers.  However, both companies retain very significant operations in Ireland. <\/p><p>  New product innovation drives the future of the Life Sciences business, and Ireland continues to provide a very attractive offering to these companies particularly in terms of access to highly-trained medical technology research and development experts and world class third level institutions.  Access to highly skilled personnel, with expertise and experience in quality-driven, advanced manufacturing techniques is hugely attractive to companies investing here. In this regard, there have been some significant investment announcements in Ireland by companies in the Life Sciences area, particularly in the Pharma\/Biopharma sector.

Following a decline in growth by foreign-owned companies from 2008 to 2011, there are now positive signs of growth in these areas.

Broadly speaking, the Action Plan for Jobs envisages that an extra 20,000 jobs can be created in manufacturing activities, while 30,000 jobs can be created in internationally traded services.  These will support a further 50,000 new indirect jobs in the economy.<\/p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, we have, with the help of Forf&aacute;s, assessed the job potential of several sectors. These include manufacturing, agri-food, ICT, tourism, Business Process Outsourcing, international financial services, retail, construction and the Green Economy.  There is a strong mix of both multinational companies and indigenous SMEs involved in these sectors.  Enterprise Ireland has set a target of supporting 10,500 new jobs on a gross basis in 2013, while IDA Ireland aims to generate 13,000 gross new jobs this year.<\/p><p>  Both the Department of Finance and the ESRI have recently produced improved employment forecasts for 2013 and 2014.  These improved forecasts are supported by the latest employment statistics published by the Central Statistics Office yesterday (26 November) which show that employment increased by 58,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2013, net of a reduction of 3,900 in public sector numbers.  This is the fourth Quarter in succession where employment has grown on an annual basis.

","asker":"1030","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 38 together.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), liability for Local Property Tax (LPT) will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date, which was 1 May 2013 for 2013 and for subsequent years, 1 November in the preceding year.  Section 119 of the Act sets out the dates for payment of the Local Property Tax and clarifies that while the LPT is due by reference to a liability date, it is not payable until a later date.  Revenue recently wrote to property owners who paid their 2013 LPT by lump sum or by way of regular cash payments to ask these owners to confirm their method for paying their LPT liability for 2014.  <\/p><p>  For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November 2013 and the tax is payable on or before 1 January 2014.  Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  <\/p><p>  These dates have been in the public domain since December 2012 when the legislation was passed.  Questions on the 1 November liability date have been raised and responded to on several occasions, including my reply to Question No. 110 on 27 March this year.  In my replies to Questions Nos. 221 (49518\/13) and 223 (49556\/13) on 19 November 2013 I advised the House that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.<\/p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I would expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  <\/p><p>  I am advised that the Revenue website includes a dedicated page outlining what property owners are required to do for 2014 and this clearly states that whoever is the liable person for the property on 1 November 2013 will be responsible for paying the tax for 2014.  In addition, Revenue spokespeople have also provided clarification on this point when taking part in national and local media interviews recently.<\/p><p>  As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i> and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.  Finally, I re-iterate that the liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is settled and has been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change the law in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700061#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brewery Licensing","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700061#WRD00450"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[50890\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700061#WRD00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the licensing regime, qualifying criteria and steps to be met in respect of a person wishing to set up a new licence for a craft brewery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this includes occupational pension schemes, Retirement Annuity Contracts, Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and Personal Retirement Bonds.  The levy applies to pension fund assets regardless of whether they relate to active or deferred members of schemes, and to the extent that pensions in payment are being paid directly from a defined benefit pension scheme the assets backing those pensions also come within the levy charge.<\/p><p>  The 0.6% levy was introduced to fund the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i> and will be abolished from the 31st of December 2014.  I indicated in my recent Budget speech, however, that I would be introducing an additional levy on pension funds, within the existing legal framework, at 0.15% in 2014 and 2015 to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i> and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.<\/p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that the levy is not imposed on individual pension scheme members whether active, deferred or retired.  Rather the chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is, however, treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.<\/p><p>  There are very few exemptions from the levy and this, in part, explains why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to keep the rate of the additional levy as low as 0.15%.  Narrowing the base of the levy would inevitably result in a greater imposition on the non-exempt schemes and I am not prepared to consider such a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700063#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700063#WRF01175"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[51079\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700063#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 60 of 14 November 2013, if the measures announced in the 2014 budget differentiate between public sector pensions and those in the private sector.

In that reply I gave information relating to the changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime announced in my 2014 Budget Statement and reflected in the recently published Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013.  The changes to the SFT regime outlined in the reply referred to above apply, as appropriate, to all defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors.  As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid public servant or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme, the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements.  The only area of difference relates to the reimbursement or recovery of chargeable excess tax by affected public servants to the pension fund administrator where the tax arises and is paid upfront by the administrator.  This arises because, unlike affected individuals in the private sector who have the flexibility to take steps (and generally do) to prevent themselves breaching the SFT or Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) if they have one so that a tax charge does not arise, public servants cannot minimise or prevent the breaching of the SFT or PFT by ceasing contributions or benefit accrual.<\/p><p>  Where the SFT or PFT is exceeded an immediate tax charge arises on the excess which can be significant.  I should stress that this part of the legislation does not remove or reduce the tax liability arising on a chargeable excess in such cases but provides more flexible options for the recoupment to the pension fund administrator of the tax paid.  These options involve effectively spreading the recovery of the tax, which has been paid up front by the public sector pension administrator, from the affected individual over a longer period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700063#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700064#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[51081\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700064#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration has been given to rental income being allowable against the local property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>The Inter-departmental group, chaired by Dr Don Thornhill, to consider the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) recommended that the Local Property Tax paid in respect of a rented property should be deductible for income tax or corporation tax purposes, in a similar manner to commercial rates.

Unemployment has fallen from 13.6% to 12.8%, and youth unemployment has decreased from 31.1% to 26.5% over the year to September 2013.<\/p><p>  In terms of indigenous industry, Enterprise Ireland recognises the significant unemployment challenge facing communities throughout Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works with its clients throughout the country to help to drive employment creation.  Enterprise Ireland employs a holistic, developmental approach and engages client companies across all aspects of the value chain. Enterprise Ireland works with clients on business development, sales and marketing capabilities, innovation and R&amp;amp;D activity, technology development, continuous competitiveness and lean improvements, on-going leadership and management development, and access to finance. <\/p><p>  In 2012, total employment in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies increased to 169,451, made up of 145,460 in full time jobs and 23,991 in part-time positions.  This positive performance by Irish companies was achieved notwithstanding the continuing economic challenges at home and abroad. The total direct and indirect employment impact associated with Enterprise Ireland client companies is estimated to total more than 300,000 jobs.<\/p><p>  The companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland; in 2012 almost two-thirds of jobs in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies were outside of Dublin.  In December 2011 Forf&aacute;s published the South East Employment Action Plan to help address the high unemployment rate facing that region.  This was followed by the development of an action plan for the Mid-West region following the decision to restructure the tourism and enterprise support agencies in the region. Enterprise Ireland is targeting the creation of 12,000 new jobs in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Direct Investment sector is a major contributor to the Irish economy, with 1,000+ companies, employing over 150,000 people and generating &euro;122bn in exports per annum. In addition, because Irelands FDI focus and competitive advantage is concentrated on high technology sectors requiring high education and skill levels, a high proportion of FDI employment and new employee take up is from young people with third level education qualifications.<\/p><p>  In addition to the direct employment impact of FDI, it also generates a substantial downstream spill over employment impact, via employment in construction, facility maintenance, services suppliers, and the spending of wages\/salaries and tax revenues in the economy. A study by Indecon consultants in 2010 for Forfas estimated this indirect employment impact to be about 70% of the direct employment impact. Again a significant amount of this indirect employment contributes to reducing youth unemployment in the economy.<\/p><p>  The FDI sector also impacts very positively on the Irish economy via the large amount of R&amp;amp;D being carried out by IDA Ireland client companies, with wide ranging positive effects on employment across the economy, much of it highly qualified young people. IDA Ireland is targeting the creation of 12,000 new jobs in 2014.<\/p><p>  Despite the significant job losses in manufacturing up to 2010, there are now 205,700 people directly employed in the sector in Ireland, and a similar number of people employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore just over 400,000.  In 2012, in order to build on the potential for this sector I asked Forf&aacute;s to undertake an analysis of Manufacturing in Ireland and the resultant Strategy, which I launched earlier this year, sets a comprehensive suite of recommendations to develop the sector, which are now being progressed. The Strategy identifies that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in Manufacturing by 2016.  The tide is already turning, as in the years 2011 and 2012 there was a net increase of 3,700 jobs in the Manufacturing sector. Some of the other more detailed statistics requested by the Deputy are not readily available. <\/p><p>  A particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. The further development of the sector will, of course, build on this key feature. In addition, the wider economic indicators are now looking quite positive.  The Private Sector is creating an overall 3,000 jobs every month as our competitiveness improves and consumer confidence slowly returns. This is a dramatic recovery from the position of a few years ago.<\/p><p>  The role of the County Enterprise Boards is to promote entrepreneurship, company start-ups and expansion, and job creation at local level. In 2012 the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards created 4,858 new full time jobs, and are expecting to create a similar number in 2013 and 2014.<\/p><p>  The Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, together with the Enterprise Ireland, is also examining options for CEB-led initiatives aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship, including a mix of financial supports for business start-ups, feasibility studies and mentoring. <\/p><p><b><i>Background Information<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><b><i>Programmes aimed at youth &amp;amp; regional entrepreneurship<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><b><i>Enterprise Ireland Graduate Programmes<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland currently has two graduate development programmes which are primarily focussed at the under 25 age group (less than 2 years post graduation) &ndash; The Innovate Programme delivered by WIT and the Graduates 4 International Growth Programme (G4IG).

While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the total number of jobs lost in 2012 was 7,815; the number of jobs gained in 2012 was 14,187.  Therefore the total <i>net new full-time jobs<\/i> created in the agency supported service industry for 2012 is 6,372. This is very positive growth.

This is part of a wider global pattern. Although it is very challenging in an internationally competitive environment, there is considerable potential for the manufacturing and services sectors in Ireland, as we are strongly placed to create opportunities and employment in many higher skilled, higher-value sub sectors, where we have a competitive advantage and it is important we concentrate on these areas and maintain our natural advantages.  This will assist in our work of attracting Foreign Direct Investment.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the wider economic indicators are now looking quite positive.

The 2012 results represented the third consecutive year of growth in net employment in IDA Ireland client companies.  <\/p><p>  Work in winning new investments has been continuing steadily in the second half of 2013 and, on the basis of the trends so far, I am confident that the targets set out for IDA Ireland in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, of winning more than 130 new investments, securing &euro;500m in R&amp;amp;D and creating 13,000 jobs in IDA client companies, will be achieved.  Among the companies who announced job creation plans or fresh investment plans to date in 2013, were: Ebay, EMC, McAfee, Pfizer, Sanofi, Symantec, Zurich, Huawei, Yahoo, Facebook, Vistakon, Guidewire, Squarespace, Groupon, Qualcomm, Novartis, Nypro, AOL FireEye, and Deutsche Bank.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland is nearing completion of the fourth of its five year Horizon 2020 strategy and the latest results put the organisation ahead of target in meeting its goal of creating 62,000 direct jobs by 2014 from 640 new investments. Over the course of the first three years (2010-2012) IDA has secured 419 investments and has delivered gross job gains of over 36,000.<\/p><p><b>Table showing data relating to FDI performance from 2007 to 2012<\/b><table><tr><th><b>Employment Data<\/b><\/th><th><b>2007<\/b><\/th><th><b>2008<\/b><\/th><th><b>2009<\/b><\/th><th><b>2010<\/b><\/th><th><b>2011<\/b><\/th><th><b>2012<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Permanent Employment <\/b><\/td><td>140,369<\/td><td>139,457<\/td><td>126,866<\/td><td>126,305<\/td><td>130,867<\/td><td>136,505<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Other Jobs <\/b><\/td><td>15,939<\/td><td>13,453<\/td><td>11,788<\/td><td>13,976<\/td><td>15,348<\/td><td>16,280<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total Number Employed<\/b><\/td><td>156,308<\/td><td>152,910<\/td><td>138,654<\/td><td>140,281<\/td><td>146,215<\/td><td>152,785<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700070#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":272,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 103 to 106, inclusive, answered together.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Upward Only Rent Reviews","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700071#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[51095\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700071#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which upward-only rent reviews continue to present problems in the retail and commercial sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Forf&aacute;s report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo;, which was published on 8th April 2013 last, indicates that business costs have reduced significantly in recent years with overall price levels in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002.  The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by dramatic reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services.<\/p><p>  However, the Government has taken steps to address the issue where possible.  In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property.  NAMA has published its policy guidance which will inform the approach to be taken where relevant tenants are experiencing difficulties in paying rents.  Under the Guidance Note, which NAMA published in December 2011, it has to date approved rent abatements proposed by its debtors and receivers with an aggregate annual value of in excess of &euro;17m.  NAMA has refused only 10 of the 312 applications received to date.<\/p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs also includes a number of specific actions to support a sustainable commercial property market, including ensuring that the commercial leases database is established and fully operational in 2013.  The Commercial Leases Database was published by the Property Services Regulatory Authority on 31st October, 2013.  The total number of leases entered into since 1 January 2010 to 31st October 2013 is 24,747.  <\/p><p>  The Commercial Leases Database is available on the Property Services Regulatory Authority website:   .  It will bring much-needed transparency to the commercial property market and will empower both landlords and tenants to reach a commercially informed decision when negotiating new leases, dealing with rent reviews, and lease restructuring and renewals. <\/p><p>  In relation to the rent review issue in historic leases, the Government has repeatedly urged that maximum flexibility be shown during the course of rent negotiations and has called upon all parties to act responsibly and in a way which takes full account of the broader national interest.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs recognises the importance of the retail sector to the economy and the 2013 Action Plan contains a number of measures aimed at supporting that sector.  These include an initiative to increase the number of small businesses trading on-line and an initiative to streamline business licence application procedures. Employers in the retail sector can also avail of the JobsPlus initiative which provides financial assistance to employers who recruit people who have been out of work for 12 months or more.  The Government has also established an Interdepartmental Group to consider further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which are currently being considered for inclusion in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.<\/p><p>  The Government attaches great importance to a thriving retail and commercial sector, and is committed to supporting these sectors wherever support is feasible. Continuing action is being taken across Government to reduce the costs of doing business, which is intended to have a positive impact on areas such as energy, local authority rates, and the administrative burden involved in companies complying with Government regulations and tax systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700071#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700071#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[51096\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700071#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which job creation throughout County Kildare tends to be specifically targeted at areas of higher than average unemployment and youth unemployment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>I believe that the policies being pursued by my Department are making a positive impact in supporting enterprises and job creation.  Despite international and domestic difficulties, there has been an annual increase of 3.2% in employment of 58,000 people.  Unemployment has fallen from 13.6% to 12.8%, and youth unemployment has decreased from 31.1% to 26.5% over the year to September 2013.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to addressing the problem of employment, and in particular, youth unemployment. Our primary strategy is to create the environment for economic recovery through competitiveness, enterprise and job creation through the Action Plan for Jobs. In addition, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in Pathways to Work, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p>  Pathways to Work programmes such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum, JobsPlus and the ICT Action Plan, are delivered by the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  The Department of Social Protection is also working with relevant Departments, including my own, to produce a concrete plan for implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland, for consideration by the Government before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of the year.<\/p><p>  My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, current initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, along with the Microenterprise Loan Fund, all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs. In 2014, the CEBs will also place a focus on supporting entrepreneurship among young people.<\/p><p>  More than 48,000 jobs will be created in 2014 through supports from my Department as a result of the measures announced in Budget 2014. Some of the specific measures announced include:<\/p><p> - A package of new initiatives to support start-ups and growing businesses, including Start Your Own Business Scheme &ndash; a 2-year income tax exemption for long-term unemployed people who start their own business,<\/p><p> - A total of &euro;18.5m for CEBs to support enterprise development, an increase of &euro;3.5m on the Budget 2013 Estimate.<\/p><p> - Continued provision for a total of over &euro;2billion in non-bank credit schemes for business.<\/p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards companies had their best performance in many years, with the agencies&rsquo; clients creating just over 30,000 new jobs between them last year.  The services and supports of these Agencies are available to both indigenous and FDI companies throughout County Kildare. <\/p><p>  The County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) throughout the country provide supports, both financial and non-financial or &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports, to all micro-enterprises in the start-up or expansion phase in manufacturing and services, subject to certain conditions. The soft supports include the provision of business advice, mentoring and training to all clients. The aim is to develop indigenous enterprise potential, stimulate economic activity at local level and promote the establishment of micro-enterprises within their administrative area.<\/p><p>  Anyone interested in starting or expanding their own business should in the first instance contact their local County and City Enterprise Board (CEB).

The Scandinavian child care model, while being a very comprehensive model, is also a very expensive model. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D\/CYA) estimates that the cost of universal child care provision in Ireland could reach around &euro;1 billion per annum.  In light of the current fiscal environment, this level of funding is not available.<\/p><p>  The early childhood care and education (ECCE) programme is a universal programme implemented by the D\/CYA and provides a free pre-school year for all eligible children before they commence primary school. Approximately &euro;175 million is provided annually to support the programme. In the school year 2012\/2013 approximately 68,000 children availed of the free pre-school provision.  The community child care subvention scheme is operated by D\/CYA and supports in excess of 25,000 children, across some 1,000 community\/not-for-profit child care providers. Under this scheme child care providers charge reduced fees to disadvantaged and low-income parents. Access to affordable child care is one of the key supports required by customers of the Department of Social Protection when entering employment. Customers of the Department can access the ECCE programme, the CCS programme, the child care education and training scheme (CETS) and the after school child care (ASCC) scheme.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the After-school Child Care scheme (ASCC) is to help offset some of the after-school child care costs that are associated with availing of an employment opportunity. The scheme supports those who are unemployed as well as OFP recipients and is funded from the transfer of savings from my Department to the D\/CYA. <\/p><p>  The ASCC scheme was piloted during 2013 and following a review of the pilot, I have the agreed with Minister Fitzgerald to re-focus the funding for 2014.  This will allow for a new strand of child care support for customers of my Department who are participating in the community employment (CE) scheme. This new child care support will provide an additional 1,800 places on top of the existing 2,800 places, which are currently available under the child care education and training support (CETS) scheme that is administered by the D\/CYA. The CETS provides subsidised child care places to clients of my Department participating in education, training and now community employment programmes. <\/p><p>  In addition the ASCC scheme is now available nationally and will provide 800 subsidised after-school child care places in 2014. The allocation of places, funding for the scheme, and the design of the scheme itself will be monitored and reviewed &ndash; as appropriate &ndash; during 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700074#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700074#WRR00600"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[51050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700074#WRR00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"what will happen if Ireland's youth unemployment rate drops below 25% in terms of eligibility for EU funding under the youth guarantee scheme.","asker":"969","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>Eligibility for EU funding through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for the period 2014-2018, which is being front-loaded in the two years 2014 and 2015, will be based on 2012 regional youth unemployment rates.

These Regulations, which build on the commercial food waste regulations introduced in 2009, are designed to promote the segregation and recovery of household food waste, in line with the national policy and the Waste Framework Directive objectives of maximising the resource which can be extracted from waste and minimising the disposal of waste.\u00a0 They will increase the amount of food waste that is recovered through the production of energy, compost and digestate, thereby creating opportunities for added jobs and value. The Regulations will also facilitate the achievement of the targets set out in the Landfill Directive (Directive 99\/31\/EC) for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill sites, by directing source-segregated household food waste to composting and to other forms of treatment.   <\/p><p>  The Regulations impose obligations on both householders and waste collectors. Householders are obliged to segregate their food waste, and make it available for separate collection. Alternatively householders may compost the food waste at home; or bring it themselves to authorised treatment facilities (such as civic amenity sites or anaerobic digestion sites).   <\/p><p>  In respect of the end-product from the treatment of food waste as it relates to the purpose of energy production, policy measures and strategy in relation to the production of biogas for bio-fuel are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. However, I understand that academic and industry research suggest there is a potentially significant role for biogas and biomethane in meeting our renewable energy requirements, particularly in the challenging heat and transport sectors and biogas can be utilised to generate electricity, heat or as a transport fuel.<\/p><p>  There are already a number of supports in place for the use of biogas. Electricity production using anaerobic digestion of biodegradable feedstock, including food waste, is supported under the REFIT 3 scheme, with 50MW of the 310MW dedicated to this technology. REFIT 3 in its support for combined heat and power also supports the generation of renewable heat from such feedstock. In the transport sector, biogas may also be used to meet the obligations set under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.   <\/p><p>  Given the relatively early stage of technology development and cost, detailed economic analysis is required before any additional supports for biogas and biomethane appropriate to Ireland can be considered. This analysis will be carried forward in the context of implementing the forthcoming Bioenergy Strategy which is currently being finalised by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700075#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dog Breeding Establishments","counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700075#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":356,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[50881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700075#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will publish the number and size of dog breeding establishments that have registered in 2010, 2011 and 2012 by county under the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2010.","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[50892\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700075#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has reviewed the enforcement of welfare standards in each county since the implementation of the Dog Breeding Establishment Bill 2010.","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of each local authority to maintain the register of dog breeding establishments in their functional area.

","asker":"1005","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>The local government funding model will change considerably in 2014. Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   <\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014. Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed.   <\/p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. This decision has been taken in the context of Budget 2014. The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.   <\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.

During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows those who held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt before the commencement of the Act to continue with an adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must have completed the process by the 31st October 2013. <\/p><p>   One particular concern that has coincided with the expiry of the transitional provisions provided for in Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, is the position of a  small number of applicants who were at a late stage in adopting from Russia when changes to Russian legislation were enacted which meant that they were unable to complete the adoption of identified children before 31 October, 2013.  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect. In order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. <\/p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General was sought and my Department is currently examining legislative options that might assist,  possibly through the retrospective extension of the declarations of eligibility and suitability concerned. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention. I have already met and spoken with some of those prospective adoptive parents affected by the  changes in Russian legislation and have undertaken to keep them informed of any developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700081#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gaisce Awards","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700081#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[51014\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700081#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of young persons who have completed the Gaisce President's Award in 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013.

This recommendation cannot be disclosed as it contains personal, private, sensitive and confidential  information relating to the individual patient.<\/p><p>5. Develop a brief operational outline of the Gynaecology Department to assist staff who are sent there on an occasional\/intermittent basis.<\/p><p>6. Due to the complexity of work, there is a need for an updated training needs analysis of all midwifery and nursing staff on the gynaecology ward.<\/p><p>7. There should be a designated individual with responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and auditing the Basic Life Support attendance and Advanced Life Support Skills attendance, ideally a designated Resuscitation Training Officer. <\/p><p>8. An Obstetric Early Warning System should be introduced and evaluated.<\/p><p>9. Install additional phone lines in the ward.<\/p><p>10. A review of the possibility of emergency call bells or designated phones for emergencies in each room should be carried out and measures taken to address this.<\/p><p>11.

","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 to 221, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.\u00a0 The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.<\/p><p>  The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an upfront funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January this year.  The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances.  This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland authorities in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme.   \u00a0<\/p><p>  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial estimated cost budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge.  The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depended entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive.  Also, we could not agree to be solely responsible for any further overruns.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet, unfortunately, there will be a further reduction in regional and local roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million.  Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend.  The estimated figure of a requirement from my Department of &euro;10 million was based on correspondence received from SEUPB and Louth County Council.  Given the\u00a0significant difference between the initial estimates and the returned tender prices, the Deputy will\u00a0appreciate the need to take a conservative approach to the\u00a0funding requests. \u00a0<\/p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed\u00a0with my\u00a0government colleagues\u00a0and on a number of occasions\u00a0at the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) most recently on the 8th of November.  The priority\u00a0is to avoid\u00a0the loss of\u00a0the EU funding involved. As the Deputy will be aware, members of\u00a0the party that he leads are members of the \u00a0Northern Ireland Executive and of the NSMC.\u00a0<\/p><p>  It is important to note that there are time constraints with regard to the INTERREG funding.  It has to be spent by 2015. SEUPB has now decided to withdraw the letter of offer and has indicated that it proposes to re-allocate the funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered before the end of\u00a02015.  I know that officials in my Department and the Department for Regional Development have identified possible replacement projects, that will benefit cross-border communication\u00a0in the transport sector and will be working up proposals for consideration by SEUPB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700086#WRDD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taxi Licences Renewals","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700087#WREE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[50954\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112700087#WREE00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding a tax renewal fine in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick.","asker":"1056","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of the taxi industry\u00a0under the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act, 2009, including responsibility for SPSV vehicle\u00a0licensing.
