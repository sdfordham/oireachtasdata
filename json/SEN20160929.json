This issue relates to the home choice loan scheme.  The scheme was established in late 2008 or 2009 and was funded by the Exchequer to the tune of &euro;500 million initially.  However, less than &euro;4 million worth of loans have been approved by the home choice loan programme since its inception.  As I understand it, only 21 loan approvals have been granted.<\/p> <p>There has been much commentary in recent times about the difficulties people are experiencing in obtaining loans to build or purchase homes.  Obviously, the curtailment of the Central Bank mortgage lending rules has had an impact as well.  The home choice loan scheme is administered through the local authority system, however, and is not subject to the Central Bank lending rules.  Under the scheme, the borrower is only required to have 8% in savings up to a maximum threshold of borrowing &euro;285,000.  The borrower must have 8% in savings for an application to be deemed eligible.  There are other criteria, including having been refused by two other mortgage lending agencies prior to applying for the home choice loan scheme.<\/p> <p>In any event, the scheme was set up to support people who want to purchase and live in their own homes.  The State should do everything possible to afford people the opportunity to progress to a phase in their lives when they can actually do that.  The scheme is essentially defunct - it is not working.  A spokesman for Irish mortgage brokers, Mr. Karl Deeter, commented on the scheme at the end of August.  He stated not only that the scheme is defunct but also that mortgage brokers do not even know how to get in contact with the home choice loan provider.  We need to put our hands up and say the scheme has been a complete and utter failure.  However, that does not mean it should not be resurrected.  I am of the view that it should be resurrected in light of the need to provide housing and the demand that exists among individuals, especially those in rural areas who may wish to build their own homes on their own land.  Those people should be allowed to do that.  Often, the only show in town for these people is a mortgage through the lending agencies but they are not available at present despite what may be said to the contrary by those in the lending agencies.<\/p> <p>The lending rate of 3.25% is competitive within the market but why is no one applying?  The reason is that the scheme is not being promoted, marketed or structured properly.  I am keen to hear what the Minister of State has to say.  If we are not going to revamp and revitalise the scheme and make it available to everyone, then we would be as well to close the door and say that we have failed.  Finally, where has the money initially allocated to the scheme gone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#A00500","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>It is good to be back here again.  I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this issue.  It is important to bring clarity.  Like many schemes, people do not always know about them until they go looking for them.  In our offices people have asked about them in the past and we have pointed them in the right direction.  Generally, if someone wants a loan through this mechanism, they will find out about it.  However, I understand what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is saying in terms of promoting the scheme as well.<\/p> <p>The home choice loan is a Government-backed mortgage for first-time buyers introduced in 2009.  It was introduced as a temporary loan offering from local authorities.  It was designed to facilitate those in creditworthy households wishing to purchase or build new homes or purchase second-hand homes who had been affected by the credit conditions in the mortgage market.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, it can be used to build a home on land owned by individuals as well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is available nationwide through mortgage brokers, who are included on a designated panel compiled by the Housing Agency.  The loans are made and administered by four lead local authorities on behalf of all local authorities, those being, Dublin City Council, Cork City Council, Kilkenny County Council and Galway County Council.  A dedicated website, <i>www.homechoiceloan.ie<\/i>, gives full details of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>To support local authorities in operating home choice loans in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central service to them.  This shared central service processes loan applications, carries out credit checks and issues a recommendation to the local authority on each loan application in accordance with the credit policy.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis.<br\/><br\/>The loan is available to first-time buyers who can prove that they have been refused a loan from two financial institutions.  It provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage.  It is offered at a single, competitive variable interest rate, currently set at 3.25%.  Since the home choice loan scheme commenced in 2009, 21 home choice loans have been issued with a total value of more than &euro;3.9 million.<br\/><br\/>Local authorities can offer another type of product to first-time buyers.  In accordance with the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012, local authorities can offer eligible first-time buyers a local authority standard variable rate annuity mortgage loan directly, which offers a rate of 2.55%.  Like the home choice loan, this loan type is only available to individuals who have been refused a mortgage loan from two other lenders.  The annuity mortgage scheme has a lower loan limit, lower income thresholds and lower interest rates, but a higher loan-to-value, LTV, ratio at 97% compared with the home choice loan ratio of 92%.  In addition, the standard annuity mortgage is available and administered directly by local authorities.  Almost 1,100 of these loans have been provided by local authorities since 2009 when the current product was introduced, totalling &euro;87 million.<br\/><br\/>When the home choice loan and standard mortgage loans were introduced, careful attention was given to the terms and conditions that should be applied.  This was set against the background of the experience of previous mortgage lending by local authorities, under which the current level of arrears is running at approximately three times that of the private mortgage sector, presenting challenges for the home owners and lending local authorities concerned, and liberal mortgage lending by the private banking sector in the years running up to the economic collapse in 2008.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the regulations underpinning the home choice loan and the standard annuity product provided for the first time for the development of a statutory credit policy that would govern any lending under the scheme.  Decisions on all loan applications must be made in accordance with this statutory credit policy to ensure lending prudence and to assist authorities across the sector to engage consistently in responsible mortgage lending in the best interests of borrowers and local authorities as lenders.<br\/><br\/>My ministerial colleague, Deputy Coveney, and I will continue to keep the home choice loan scheme under review and we welcome whatever suggestions Senators might have as to how this product might be better publicised.  To some extent, however, what we are seeing in terms of the home choice loan is a mirror image of what is happening in the private housing market where there is a misalignment between house prices and the capacity of first-time borrowers to raise sufficient cash deposits to meet prudent financial rules that are intended to safeguard the borrower into the future.<br\/><br\/>In this context, the Senator will know that the Government has made its intentions clear in increasing the supply of affordable houses for first-time buyers into the market.  The Minister and I are committed to ensuring the ambition of Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is achieved.  The full intention is to work with all stakeholders to make houses more affordable.  Announcements in the budget in two weeks' time will help address this issue.  It is a question of supply and demand and having a product that people can afford.<br\/><br\/>I do not have information on the number of applications, but it looks like people are, for whatever reason, not choosing this product.  However, there have been more than 1,400 council loans.  People are aware of the former but are choosing the latter route.  It could have to do with the LTV ratio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#A00600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The scheme is worth &euro;500 million, but less than 0.8% of that money has been given out in mortgage loans at a time when people are looking for them.  The reply referred to the limit, the misalignment and the fact that people must have savings before they can get a mortgage, but the Central Bank's rules set a higher bar at 10% or 20% than the home choice rules do at 8%.  Therefore, one would imagine that if people have a difficulty in saving a deposit, their first port of call would be the home choice loan scheme.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State put his finger on the issue when he suggested that the scheme had not been advertised or promoted.  I call on him to leave his footprint in the Department by revamping the scheme or getting rid of it altogether.  There should not be a false impression that these loans are available.

It is not our job to force them to choose this one.  I agree that it is our job to advertise and promote the scheme, but brokers also encourage people to take out what are the best products for them.  Under this scheme, if one fails to get credit through the normal lending institutions, this is another option.  People who look to borrow money are aware of all the options.  I would have no problem with putting more effort into promoting the scheme, but please do not tell me that it is our job to make them choose it.

I also thank and acknowledge a couple of staff from St. Andrew's community centre in Rialto who are present for highlighting to me during the summer the problems facing the community service programme, CSP.  The other staff are busy hosting a local economic event in the area today.<\/p> <p>Community service projects are the bedrock of communities throughout Ireland.  They are the link in the chain that serves to empower individuals to create a better society.  They fill gaps in the provision of services that the Government does not provide.  They educate, advocate, listen, guide and enable people to become leaders in their communities.  As public representatives, we are merely the voice that is given to us from meeting projects daily, weekly and monthly.<\/p> <p>There are more than 400 community service projects throughout the country providing child care, drug rehabilitation, youth projects, community development, training, education, etc.  Without them, society would have been broken even further during the most recent recession.<\/p> <p>Since January, the minimum wage increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed this but is committed to providing for a living wage.  Community service projects also welcomed the increase in the minimum wage and view it as a means to allow their staff to live, not just to survive.  The problem arises from the fact that Pobal's annual contribution towards employing a full-time staff member remained at &euro;19,033, inclusive of employer's PRSI.  This served to pay the employee the minimum wage of &euro;8.65, with the balance covering the PRSI contribution exactly.  It was communicated to projects through Pobal that its annual contribution would not increase to provide the extra money required for them to pay the increased minimum wage lawfully.<\/p> <p>Community service projects are nothing without their employees.  The employees are the recognisable, hard-working faces that ensure communities advance.  Therefore, projects want to be able to pay them a fair wage and fulfil their responsibilities as good employers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is easily solved.

I welcome her friends and neighbours from St. Andrew's.  I acknowledge the massive contribution made by many such organisations in their communities.  I know of this from first-hand experience.<\/p> <p>On the broader issue, the provision of local, social, economic and environmental services is the core aim of the CSP.  A total of 404 service providers are supported under the CSP to provide such services through the application of a social enterprise model of delivery.  For the purposes of the CSP, a social enterprise has been defined as \"an enterprise that trades for a social\/societal purpose, where at least part of its income is earned from its trading activity, is separate from government, and where the surplus is primarily reinvested in the social objective\".  The funding provided to the service providers under the CSP is expressed as a fixed annual co-funding contribution towards the cost of employing a manager or specified number of full-time equivalent staff.  The CSP service providers are required to generate traded income from a variety of sources.  To assist with sustainability, all CSP service providers should strive to be in circumstances in which at least 30% of annual turnover is from traded income and in which the CSP grant is not more than 50% of annual turnover.<\/p> <p>The CSP grant contribution is provided on a co-funding basis and employers are expected to provide additional funds from their own resources to meet the full costs of employment.  Support for an eligible person with a 39-hour working week is &euro;19,033 per annum. The employer is expected to pay the local labour market rate for the position and to finance this from non-public grant revenue generated.  An additional contribution of &euro;32,000 per annum can also be made towards the engagement of a manager.  We should focus on that figure also.  The setting of wage rates is entirely a matter for the employer organisation in contract under the CSP.<\/p> <p>Owing to the changes to the national minimum wage from January 2016, the issue of sustainability of some CSP service providers has come into focus.  I accept that is the reason for the debate today.  In response, the Department has established - this is important also - a CSP support fund for a fixed period, between 2016 and 2018, to assist service providers in enhancing their sustainability as social enterprises.  Therefore, a CSP support fund has been established for the next two years.  The support fund is allocating additional financial supports to existing providers under the CSP to enhance their sustainability as social enterprises.  Allocations under the support fund are supplementary to the CSP contribution that service providers currently receive.  Appraisals of CSP service providers are ongoing to establish the extra funding required and it is expected to be finalised in conjunction with the current 2016 recontracting process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#C00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The response is positive but I would obviously need to take it in more.  \"Appraisal\" can be a scary word when one is considering services, including community services.

She has a 2009 car that really needs to be updated to a 2012 car.  The Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland advised her she should change car every two years, but it is four years since she has changed hers.  She called to the Castlebar clinic 18 months ago to ask for forms to apply for the motorised transport grant and was told it was stopped and to be replaced.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John O'Mahony:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->She says she has been telephoning every few months but still there is no replacement scheme.  The car is now beginning to give trouble and she is extremely worried that it is going to break down when she is out with her husband and that this could trigger a seizure.  His seizures are caused by stress, worry and anxiety.  She says she gets the VRT and VAT back on the car but even with the motorised transport grant, she still has to go to the credit union for a loan to pay for the shortfall on the car.  The older her current car gets, the more it depreciates.  This means she will have to get a bigger loan from the credit union.  She desperately needs the motorised transport grant to be reinstated because if it is not, she does not know how she will manage.  I know this case.  I have been working with this family for the past number of years.

I hope that in some of the responses this morning, we can progress this issue.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position in respect of it.  As he will already be aware, conscious of the reports of the Ombudsman regarding the legal status of both the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes.  As a result, the motorised transport grant referred to by the Senator has not been in place for over three years.  There are no plans for its restoration on the basis on which it was previously operated.  That is the first important part.  The next part is more important, however.  The Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments that support choice and independence.  In this regard, monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the mobility allowance.  The Government has decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Department of Health.  I confirm that work is at an advanced stage on policy proposals for the drafting of primary legislation for the new scheme and anticipate that it will be brought to Government shortly.  In that regard, a health (transport support) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme.<\/p> <p>The programme for a partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new transport support scheme and that both and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I are committed to its progression as soon as possible.  We are on the issue of a transport support scheme.  The proposals will seek to ensure that there is a firm statutory basis to the scheme's operation, that there is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the scheme, that resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs and that the scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable when introduced and on an ongoing basis.  The Department of Health is seeking a solution which will best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the costs of their mobility needs while keeping within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.  The challenge is to develop a new scheme on a statutory basis within a limited budget, targeted towards those with the greatest need.<\/p> <p>I assure the Senator that the matter will be brought to Government for consideration and decision as soon as possible.  I look forward to what I am sure will be a valuable and constructive debate when the Bill comes before the House in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#D00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the latter part of the reply in which he set out the position on the promised legislation.

In reality, if this is not restored quickly, the costs to the State in respect of the person I am talking about - and there are many others - will end up being a great deal more.  The letter I read was from someone who has won a national award as carer of the year.  The person is a saint on this earth.  We can talk about equality all we like but if the scheme that is implemented fails to meet the needs she has, it will cost the State multiples of what it would otherwise have to pay.  Without divulging anything about the person, some people who were in similar circumstances sued in respect of similar hospital treatment but the family to which I refer refused to do so on condition that they would be supported to care for their father and husband at home.

The first is more support for carers in society because I acknowledge the fantastic unpaid work they do.  The Senator mentioned that the particular woman could have taken a legal case but did not.  There are a lot of good, civic-minded people in our broader society who act like that and they need our support.  I accept the Senator's argument there.  Second, I will be saying to the Minister that the legislation to help these 4,700 individuals, who make a massive contribution by looking after our disabled and sick people, must address their needs.  It will reduce the cost to the State in the long term, which is a reality I accept.  I will bring those key messages back to the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p> <p>It is important that carers in Irish society are not only acknowledged and commended for their work but supported.

The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is only too well aware of the significant issue I wish to raise.<\/p> <p>Access to cardiac intervention is a critical need where a citizen has a heart attack.  Unfortunately, in the Ireland of 2016, we do not have equality of access to health care in the event of an emergency.  That is particularly the case in the south east.  The essential target response time to achieve the best cardiac intervention outcomes in the event of a heart attack is 60 to 90 minutes.  The south-east region, however, has only one catheter lab which operates at University Hospital Waterford between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. five days per week.  The south east is , therefore, the only region in the country which does not have access to 24\/7 interventional cardiac care within the critical period to which I referred.  No intervention is available after hours, which means lives are being put at risk.  This issue has been highlighted consistently by myself and others in recent years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that we examine the context and background to this issue.  In 2012, Professor John Higgins was appointed by the Government to take an objective, independent view and to make recommendations to Government on the reform of the hospital systems in the South and in the country.  His findings are otherwise known as the Higgins report. <\/p><p>In 2013, there was reform of the acute hospital network and the establishment of hospital groups.  It resulted in the break up of the old South Eastern Hospital Group that transformed what was then the Waterford Regional Hospital into the University Hospital Waterford.  At that time, clear commitments were given to the public, politicians and clinicians by the former Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, and the former Secretary General for the Department of Health, Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin.  The commitments included an enhancement of interventional cardiology at University Hospital Waterford.  The records are available for anybody to see in the Department of Health and I urge the Minister of State to make herself aware of them.  Three years later, the hospital boards have still not been appointed and commitments have not been met.  This is a serious breach of trust in the reform programme in terms of the public, politicians and health professionals.  <\/p><p>In terms of the recent Herity report, three areas require specific focus and attention.  First, the base population and throughput data that was used in the report is fundamentally flawed because it took into account the current patient throughput of a part-time service.  It also did not take into account the potential patient referrals in a region of 500,000 people if a 24 hours, seven days a week service was available.<\/p><p>Second, Dr. Herity has stated that it is possible to travel from Waterford to the University Hospital Cork within a 90 minutes' timeframe.  That is incorrect in terms of many of the outlying areas of Waterford, including south Wexford, south Tipperary, east Waterford and south Kilkenny.  His timeframe does not take into account the transfer times for patients from outlying areas, who are in urgent need of intervention, going to Waterford in the first instance.  Dr. Herity acknowledged in his report that there is no stated alternative to get patients outside the 90 minute zone to cardiac care.  The only way to do so, and logical people  would agree with me, is through the provision of an air ambulance, a measure that is not possible in the current climate.  Therefore, lives in the south east are at risk in the event of an emergency.<\/p><p>Third, I am seriously concerned about the fact that the Department of Health gave a note to Dr. Herity prior to him compiling his report.  That gives the impression, whether it is right or wrong, that Dr. Herity was guided by the Department officials and, thus, his report was pre-determined.  The situation raises questions about the independence of his report and is a matter that needs further analysis and examination.  In my opinion, the basic flaws in his report undermines its findings and recommendations.  Alternative findings have been proposed to the Minister and we ask him to consider them.  It is essential that the three aspects of the report that I have identified be reviewed before decisions are made about the future of the cardiology services in the south-east region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#D00600","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter that I know has been close to his heart for a long time.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, who is unable to be here this morning due to a pre-arranged meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  He has asked me to convey his sincere apologies.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will know, the Minister received the report on the independent clinical review of the need for provision of a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford, on foot of the programme for Government commitment.  The report was completed by Dr. Niall Herity, a consultant cardiologist and clinical director of cardiology at Belfast Health and Social Care Trust.  He is a well known and highly respected cardiologist in Belfast.  It is a comprehensive report that reflects the fact that Dr. Herity consulted widely and met all of the key stakeholders, including the management and staff of both University Hospital Waterford and Cork University Hospital.<\/p> <p>Dr. Herity's calculation of the catchment population for the University Hospital Waterford's cath lab has been challenged since publication of the review.  In his report, Dr. Herity quite rightly points out that it would be a mistake to assume that the catchment area of University Hospital Waterford is represented by every resident in Waterford and its surrounding counties.  Dr. Herity therefore determined the effective catchment population by looking at regional patient flow data and combining this with 2016 census data in terms of the population of Waterford and surrounding counties.<\/p> <p>Dr. Herity has provided robust evidence that a second cardiac cath lab at University Hospital Waterford is not justified.  However, he recommends increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, along with the requisite additional staffing for the increase in sessions, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access.  He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure.  The Minister is happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations and, as such, significantly improve services for patients at University Hospital Waterford.  This investment will be reflected in the HSE's national service plan for 2017.  During this period of investment and enhancement of services, the situation will be closely monitored.  A further independent clinical review will be carried out in early 2017 to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending the cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.<\/p> <p>Dr. Herity has recommended that University Hospital Waterford's cath lab should operate as an elective lab that provides all specialised cardiac services except interventional treatment for patients who are having heart attacks.  Dr. Herity has also recommended that the current nine to five provision of these services should cease to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned cath lab work.<\/p> <p>Senators will understand that the Minister must be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using the service.  Therefore, he has asked the Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a national review of all primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, services with the aim of ensuring that as many patients as possible have access, on a 24-7 basis, to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  It is expected that this review will be completed by the end of July 2017.<\/p> <p>The Minister intends to visit University Hospital Waterford in the coming weeks.  He will take the opportunity to speak with staff and management on a broad range of issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#E00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the recommendation to enhance services at the existing cath lab.  The recommendation should be implemented without delay.<\/p><p>I take issue with the fact that Dr. Herity has claimed he engaged with important stakeholders in the south east.  He did not visit Wexford General Hospital, St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny or South Tipperary General Hospital even though they are all hospitals in the region and catchment area of University Hospital Waterford.  If he had done so, he would have heard the views of the consulted cardiologists in all of those hospitals and the GPs in the region who are critical stakeholders.  <\/p><p>I repeat my three issues of concern.  First, the base population and throughput data that Dr. Herity used in his report is fundamentally flawed.  Second, he stated that it is possible to travel from Waterford to Cork in 90 minutes.  That is the best estimate but it does not allow for outlying areas that is critical in terms of a heart attack and accessing interventional care.  Third, I am deeply disturbed and suspicious about the fact that Department of Health officials gave a note to Dr. Herity prior to him completing his report.  That scenario raises questions about the independence of his report.  <\/p><p>I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State present or to the Minister for Health, but I am concerned given the context and history of this issue, the recommendations of Professor John Higgins who was appointed by the Government in 2012, and the commitments that were entered into at the highest levels in Government and also at the highest levels in the Department of Health.  The 2013 commitments are on the record in the Department of Health and state:<\/p><blockquote>The establishment of Hospital Groups will enhance cardiology cover in WRH.  At present this is provided from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The increased flexibility of staff across the group will help enable us achieve our goal of providing cardiology cover at Waterford Regional Hospital 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  <\/blockquote> <p>What has changed since then?  I deeply suspect that it is not the Minister for Health that is at issue here.  I believe the Department of Health officials have an agenda.  They are against the people who live in the south-east region and University Hospital Waterford due to being interested in providing efficiency in terms of health services.  That efficiency excludes people who have an equal right to access care when they have a heart attack in the region.  People are being deprived of that right.  As a Government Senator, and as a former Minister of State, I am deeply disturbed by what has happened with the hospital groups, the non-committal of the commitments that were given, and also the non-establishment of hospital boards in three years.  <\/p><p>The Dublin press and media have painted this matter as a local parish pump issue but that is not the case.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is a regional issue that potentially affects approximately 500,000 people and many of those have families who cannot access the service in an appropriate timescale.

We often hear that doctors differ.  This is one doctor who has given an opinion, there are many others giving a different opinion.

On an ongoing basis, we are left without mobile phone coverage and without broadband coverage.  I have been contacted recently by a business in Roscommon that cannot open, even though it has the potential to create quite a number of jobs, because the proprietor cannot get the required connectivity.  At the briefing this morning, we were told that the broadband services are the remit of the national broadband plan.  The bottom line is there needs to be more co-ordination between the respective Departments of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten and the Minister Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, as one is dependent on the other.

The Minister is talking about supplying 1,600 of them.<\/p><p>It was reported in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>at the weekend that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is to shut the door on tax reliefs for Airbnb.  Airbnb-type businesses are having an enormous effect on the supply of housing, especially in urban areas, and it is estimated that we have lost between 1,500 and 2,000 units that were in the ordinary rental market to Airbnb-type accommodation.  I suggest to the Leader of the House that he bring it to the attention of both Ministers that to shut the door on the tax relief for rental of rooms, while important for the student market, will not have the effect that we want in shutting the door on the transfer of units that are let long-term.  Two or three months ago, five apartments in my area on the South Circular Road that were rented to ordinary people on rent allowance working in the Civil Service and other areas where transferred to Airbnb.  Those are five units where the people had to leave.  During the rounds of discussions with various lobby groups about what changes they want to see in the budget, one person pointed out to me that five apartments in the Smithfield area that were let long-term by tenants who were working in the city were transferred to short-term lets.<\/p><p>Both Ministers need to look at what is happening throughout the world in this regard.  In Berlin, regulations are being brought in to control the number of units transferring to Airbnb accommodation.  Only 50% of a flat in Berlin can be on a short-term lease.  Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick are not alone in dealing with this problem.  This is affecting Berlin, London and Seattle, to name but a few cities which are bringing in regulation and legislation to control it.<\/p><p>We are in a period of constrained supply.  While I welcome the Minister's proposal to build 1,500 rapid-build units, if we lose 1,500 at the other end, it will not serve any purpose.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to look at this.  He stated he would announce in the budget efforts to shut the door on tax relief on short-term lets, given the impact that is having on student accommodation.  We also need to look at efforts to shut the door to ensure we do not see the transfer over to short-term lease of units currently being let in the market because that will make our housing situation far worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#H01100","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>The budget negotiations are under way and there is engagement with the various parties and stakeholders.

It is important to state that while it is popular for politicians to support all of these increases, at the same time we, as politicians, are looking for enhanced resources in terms of public service provision.  We need to be careful.  It is a fact that 70% to 80% of public expenditure goes in pay and pensions and that leaves just over 20% for public services.

Local residents have become extremely concerned about these incidents.  There are many old people in the vicinity living on their own, as well as many parents of young children.  They are becoming increasingly concerned due to several absconsions and a fire on the roof causing considerable damage to the wonderful facility.  There was an incident where a staff member was locked in a room and held to ransom.  The Garda eventually had to go to the facility to release the staff member.  The newspapers report that this day last week over &euro;1 million worth of damage was caused to the facility.<\/p> <p>Over the past several months, clearly whatever protocols are in place at this facility are not working.  Staff feel threatened.  I know many of them myself as I worked there as a general practitioner.  Many of the staff have worked there for years but do not want to go back.  Having been the Minister involved with the facility&rsquo;s development, I know it was difficult to get staff to work there.  Accordingly, it makes it all the more important that they should be retained and feel protected at work.<\/p> <p>The facility&rsquo;s board has apologised for certain failures around texting alerts, etc., when there have been break-outs and will rectify these, as well as ordering a review of existing protocols.

Given this and the money invested in the facility, will the Leader invite the Minister to attend the House to explain what has gone wrong at the facility and why there have been a significant number of incidents there?<\/p> <p>I believe the protocols in place do not allow staff to deal with young offenders.  These are young men, 16 and 17, some of whom are aggressive and are as large as many of us, if not larger.

During the week, NAI announced that it had booked slots from March onwards and was proposing to put in place a price structure of as low as &euro;100, which is very competitive.<\/p> <p>The main issue for us is licensing.  I welcome the Taoiseach's statement during the week that he was putting pressure on US authorities to get the issue sorted.  It is important that this open air licensing agreement be enforced.  Due to political issues in the US, we will probably not have an agreement until after the election, but it is important that we keep the matter on the agenda as one of the key drivers for tourism, particularly in the southern region.  It would provide us with great connectivity, which I hope would help the tourism industry in the country's south to develop.  I would like to think that, after the election, we will have the opportunity to discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade how we can work with him, and what pressure our Chamber can apply, to deliver these important transatlantic flights for Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#K01600","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach b&aacute;ire tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh don chl&aacute;r a rinne \"Prime Time\" an o&iacute;che faoi dheireadh faoin phicti&uacute;rlann nua at&aacute; &aacute; th&oacute;g&aacute;il i nGaillimh.  A few nights ago, \"Prime Time\" highlighted the development of the arthouse cinema in Galway.  It chronicled a host of serious issues with the way that the project progressed.  We should investigate these.  Although it is a local matter, it points to a broader issue within the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs as to why proper oversight was not in place.  We have been told that &euro;6 million in State funding was invested in the arthouse cinema project and that a further &euro;1 million will be needed, and there are questions about the fund-raising used to supplement the State funding and so on, but it appears from the report that at no point was there proper oversight of whether moneys were available, a proper business plan was in place, etc.<\/p> <p>A number of substantial capital projects have been earmarked for Galway in the context of it being awarded the European Capital of Culture 2020.

Such appointments should be fully independent of any parts of the Oireachtas.  As Senator Paul Coghlan said, we have the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  As the Upper House, it is important for us to allow for the discussion at Cabinet to continue.  I am not afraid of having a debate on it because I share Senator McDowell's view.  I agree to Senator Norris's proposal that we should have that discussion at the earliest opportunity.

When I hear Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill lecturing us, I invite Members of his party to cast their minds back to when they were in government and the way in which they wrecked the country.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Collectively, we must make people's lives better.  If that means a reduction in the universal social charge, USC, an increase in public services or a modest pay increase, then let us try to do that.  However, let us not be a catch-all to everybody.

It required a completely new approach based on consultation and building consensus towards a new vision for our people.  That vision is that we want a fair society based on a strong economy.  We want thriving communities in urban and rural Ireland.  We want an Ireland that looks after its people from the time they are born until the time they leave.  We want an Ireland where everybody is given the opportunity to succeed and where nobody is left behind.  We want people to have the peace of mind that comes from feeling safe and secure in their lives and homes.<\/p><p>The new programme for a partnership Government sets out a detailed set of actions and commitments to be implemented by the Government over its lifetime.  The new political landscape has presented an opportunity to reform radically Irish politics and fundamentally change the relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas and, with it, the relationship between the Irish people and their Parliament.  We have embraced a new and collaborative approach, not only with the partners of the Government but with the partners of the Opposition.  This includes reform of how the D&aacute;il conducts its business, the budgetary process and Oireachtas committee structures, and developing a communications process between Departments and Deputies.  I will return to this later.<\/p><p>The programme for Government sets out an ambitious programme of work.  It has one simple objective at its core, namely, to make people's lives better in every part of this country.  A fair society must lean on a strong economy.  That strong economy will work primarily to create a fair and compassionate society of which people can feel part and proud, a society for everyone.<\/p><p>Our country and people have come through an unprecedented economic crash.  Every family in Ireland has been touched in some way or other during this crisis.  In the past five years, members of the previous Government and I have worked to end that crisis, exit the international bailout and help with the creation of new jobs.  Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic success remains central to our work.  While the sense of economic crisis may have passed, we still have a great deal of work ahead of us to ensure that work and opportunity are present for all families across the country.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs has won recognition from the OECD as a coherent and effective way of confronting urgent priorities.  Its features can equally be applied to other urgent priorities.  It also facilitates a way of governing that involves a genuine partnership and maximises the chance of delivering upon objectives.  One of the first priority actions of the Government has been to apply this process to tackle the housing crisis by publishing a new action plan on housing.<\/p><p>There are many challenges ahead, including in respect of housing and homelessness, education and health, and broadband and rural development.  We are committed to tackling these challenges head-on to build a society in which the recovery is felt by every individual and family around the country.  As part of the process, I have met individual Ministers to agree their priorities for the coming year, taking into account the actions and ambitions contained in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>The outcome of the UK referendum on the European Union was not the result we had hoped for.  However, the Government has put a clear plan in place to deal with this and has a contingency framework that maps out the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming months.  These priority areas for the Government are Northern Ireland and the peace process, the common travel area, the economy and the European Union itself.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that, from all my engagements with international leaders, Ireland&rsquo;s priorities are well understood, in particular the importance of protecting the peace process and of Europe&rsquo;s contribution to peace in Ireland.<b><\/b>The peace settlement in Northern Ireland is by now well established, but we are still far from a time when we can take it for granted.<b><\/b>At the North-South Ministerial Council summit in Dublin Castle in July, the Irish Government and Northern Ireland Executive agreed to work together to ensure the peace process is safeguarded, that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and that the importance of North-South co-operation is fully recognised in any new arrangements that emerge from negotiations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=580\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=580&amp;amp;pid=EndaKenny&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government believes there is a need for the widest possible conversation on the implications of the referendum result for Ireland, North and South, and for North-South future relations.  As I said in the D&aacute;il during the week, I intend to convene an all-island dialogue on the implications of Brexit in the near future because I believe there are many issues of mutual interest and concern that need to be discussed and talked about.<\/p><p>I welcome Prime Minister May's assurance that Northern Ireland, with all the devolved administrations, will be centrally involved in developing the UK's position prior to entering into any negotiations with the European Union.  Neither the Irish Government nor the British Government wish to see a return to the borders of the past on the island of Ireland.  We will do our utmost to avoid barriers to cross-Border traffic and economic activity.  We are also conscious of the past symbolism of the Border and the wider negative psychological impact it had on the Border areas and, more generally, across both parts of the island.  We value the common travel area.  We will work to keep it in place to the greatest extent possible as part of future arrangements.  There is absolutely no desire to limit the freedom of people on both sides of the Irish Sea to live, work and travel freely across these islands.<\/p><p>It remains to be seen precisely what impact Brexit might have on the UK economy but, because of our close economic ties, any negative impact on the UK economy could have adverse implications for us.  Ireland's strong recovery has ensured that our economy is open, attractive and competitive.  I am confident that it is resilient and that appropriate fiscal policies are now in place to help us adjust to the economic effects and impacts of Brexit.<\/p><p>We do not expect our budget for 2017 to be significantly affected, but it will take account of likely impacts to the extent that we know of in the early stages.  We are continuing to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for mobile international investment and talented people.  We will of course seek to take any opportunities that arise for Ireland from Britain's decision to leave the European Union.  The economic interests of our countries are most certainly best served by having the United Kingdom in a close trading relationship with the European Union.<\/p><p>We remain fully committed to our membership of the Union and the eurozone.  Engagement with EU partners and the EU institutions remains a high priority.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I remain actively engaged with our European counterparts, as are other Ministers.  Diplomatic contacts are being intensified in European capitals.  At an informal meeting of the 27 Heads of State on 16 September in Bratislava, I outlined Ireland's contribution to the vision for the future of the European Union.  We will continue to contribute to discussions on the renewal of the Union and we will be an integral part of a re-energised European Union subsequent to the conclusion of the discussions of and negotiations on Brexit.<\/p><p>We will bring forward our proposals for the budget for 2017 on 11 October.  While we, as a country, have many reasons to be positive about the future, we have to remember the lessons that have been learned over the past decade.  The gains we have made have been hard-won and the Government is not going to put them at risk.  Budget 2017, therefore, will be prudent, reflect our need to underpin Ireland's economic recovery and ready us for the future.  This is particularly necessary given that the international environment remains uncertain, not least in the context of the UK decision to leave the EU and the continuing low levels of economic growth in Europe.  The Government will, therefore, continue to take a responsible approach to the management of our public finances.  The choices we make have to be forward-looking and sustainable and must be focused on those areas where need is greatest.  We have made it clear that where we have headroom &ndash; the Minister for Finance has made clear that it is constrained and somewhat limited - two thirds will be directed towards public spending and one third towards tax measures.  The budget for 2017 will prioritise new measures to help make people's lives better and deliver better services for them, in particular, for hard-pressed working families.  The Government will also maintain its strong focus on the issues we have identified as being of greatest urgency, not least ensuring a functioning housing market and investment in the infrastructure Ireland needs for the future.  We will also continue to work to ensure that our economy is Brexit-ready and that Ireland continues to be an open and attractive place in which to do business.  These are the pillars on which we build.<\/p><p>Another key priority for Government is responding to the housing and homelessness challenge, the subject of so much discussion and coverage in recent years.  It is universally acknowledged that, as a country, we are not producing enough new homes to meet our needs.  Reflecting the urgency and priority attached to the issue, I appointed a senior Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  As I said already, we committed in our programme for partnership Government to the publication of a new action plan within 100 days, and it has already been published.  We published it in July within that timeframe.  The detailed and comprehensive work carried out by the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness over a tight timeframe fed into the development of that plan.  There are five key pillars in the plan: addressing homelessness; accelerating social housing delivery; building more homes for the wider housing market; improving the rental sector; and making the best use of the housing we have.<\/p><p>Over 80 specific time-bound commitments are contained in the housing action plan.  These include commitments to: double the annual level of residential construction to 25,000 units; roll out a &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund; and to develop a comprehensive strategy for the house rental sector.  Government has set a target of 47,000 new social homes by 2021 supported by an investment of &euro;5.35 billion.  We are trebling the rapid-build programme to 1,500 homes and we have provided &euro;70 million for the Housing Agency to buy vacant properties throughout the country.  Implementation of the plan is progressing, overseen by the Cabinet committee on housing, and we will publish quarterly progress reports in each of these separate areas.<\/p><p>Members will be aware that the establishment of a citizens' assembly was a commitment in the programme for Government.  A resolution approving the establishment of the assembly was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in July.  The following topics will be for consideration by the assembly and the assembly will make a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on each item: first, the eighth amendment to the Constitution; second, how we best respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population; third, fixed-term parliaments; fourth, the manner in which referendums are held; and fifth, how the State can become a leader in tackling climate change.  The assembly will also be asked to consider such other matters as may be referred to it.<\/p><p>The resolution sets a time limit of one year from the date of the first assembly meeting for completion of the assembly's work, but does not set a time limit for individual items.  However, it specifies that the eighth amendment to the Constitution will be the first item that the assembly will report on.  The report on the eighth amendment, when completed, will be sent to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On receipt, the Houses will refer the report for consideration to a committee of both Houses which, in turn, will bring its conclusions to the Houses for debate.<\/p><p>On 27 July, the Government approved the appointment of Ms Justice Mary Laffoy as chairperson of the citizens' assembly.  Membership will consist of 100 persons: 99 citizens entitled to vote at a referendum, randomly selected so as to be broadly representative of Irish society by a polling company commissioned for that purpose, plus the chairperson.  The recruitment process is now nearing completion.  As I indicated, the inaugural meeting of the citizens' assembly will take place on 15 October next.  The timing and nature of public consultation and the method by which interested parties will be selected to make presentations to the assembly will be a matter for the chairperson and assembly members themselves.  It will, of course, be open to interest groups and members of the public to make written submissions for consideration by the assembly.  Plenary sessions of the citizens' assembly will be streamed live via the website.  The focus of the broadcast will be on those making presentations.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, the new political landscape in this country presents an opportunity to reform Irish politics and to change the relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas.  On 10 March 2016, the first sitting day of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, the House passed an all-party motion to task the sub-committee with identifying a package of reforms to strengthen Parliament for the people, something that Members on all sides agreed was necessary.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=580\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=580&amp;amp;pid=EndaKenny&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The House passed an all-party motion to task the sub-committee with identifying a package of reforms to strengthen Parliament for the people, which Members on all sides agreed was necessary.  As an initial step, the sub-committee consulted D&aacute;il Members and sought submissions for consideration.  It received 28 submissions.  Since then, the sub-committee has met 18 times to consider a number of matters raised in the submissions.  On 19 May, the House adopted a package of reforms proposed by the sub-committee and, over the following weeks, the House amended existing Standing Orders and adopted new Standing Orders to give effect to the reforms that were agreed.<\/p><p>The following are the main reforms proposed.  It was proposed to give more power to Parliament to plan and make arrangements for its own business, with the establishment of a new Business Committee comprising Government and Opposition Deputies, who together plan the House business on a weekly, sessional and yearly basis.  The legislative priorities of the House are now agreed by all parties.  The Business Committee has been operating successfully since June with all decisions reached by consensus.  The Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann have also implemented a system whereby the Leader convenes a meeting with all the other Seanad group leaders every Wednesday to discuss the following week's business.<\/p><p>Another proposal was for better scrutiny of the annual budgetary cycle by the new Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight, supported in its work by a new independent budget office, which is being established and which will crunch the numbers for the new committee.  It was proposed to have an increased role for the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser to allow the office assist backbench Members in drafting legislation and give advice on all legislation coming before the House.<\/p><p>It was proposed to change the rules around groups to allow more than one technical group to be formed.  This enables Independents and Members in small parties to join forces to get a greater share of parliamentary set pieces, for example, Private Members&rsquo; time.  A rearrangement of the sitting day was proposed so that the House, wherever possible, does not clash with committee meetings.  People are aware of having to leave committee meetings to vote in divisions.  This enables Members to give more time to both plenary sittings and committees and not to have to choose whether to attend one or the other.<\/p><p>Pre-legislative scrutiny will be extended to non-Government Bills which pass Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, which will increase the possibility of those Bills being enacted.  A new Irish language committee was established.  Members now have the facility formally to record their abstention from a vote, which was not previously available, and to put on the record of the House an explanation for their abstention or for the way they voted.  Improvements were proposed to both the parliamentary questions process and the way in which the Government answers questions on its promised legislation on the Order of Business.  A voting time on Thursday afternoons was introduced, which represents a more efficient use of the House&rsquo;s time.<\/p><p>This new way of doing business will be a catalyst for improved communication between Ministers and their Departments and Opposition spokespersons and their teams.  A more cohesive Oireachtas will lead to better consensus on legislation.  To help facilitate this approach, a parliamentary liaison unit has been established in my Department.  The role of the unit is to facilitate the enhanced relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas.  The unit is working alongside the Chief Whip's office to support Ministers and their Departments in the management and implementation of the legislative programme.<\/p><p>Seanad reform is of great interest to the Members here and of great concern to everybody.  In order to progress the reform process, I established an independent working group on Seanad reform in December 2014.  The principal focus of the working group was on possible reforms of the Seanad electoral system within the existing constitutional parameters.  The working group also explored ways of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann generally and the manner in which it carries out its business.  The group examined these issues also within existing constitutional parameters.<\/p><p>The working group examined submissions and proposals for reform which have already been made and looked at.  These were as follows: the role of a reformed Seanad within the political process; the powers and functions of a reformed Seanad; and any such matter as the working party saw as relevant.  The group sought submissions and suggestions from interested parties and took into consideration the 11 official reports since 1937 and the many submissions made during the Seanad referendum process in 2013.  The group, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, met on seven occasions and published its report on 13 April 2015.<\/p><p>The working group identified the main problems with the existing situation as: an electoral system which was elitist and which disfranchised a majority of citizens; a constitutional concept of vocational representation which had little substance in practice; and the absence of clear defining guidelines of the distinctive role of the Seanad in public life.  The proposals of the working party meet these issues head-on.  The report, if implemented, will develop and strengthen the vocational nature of the Seanad.  It will make possible the participation of all Irish citizens in Seanad general elections.  It will establish a franchise for Irish emigrants who are Irish citizens and allow electoral participation of those normally resident in Northern Ireland.  It will also maintain the link between national and local politics through an electoral college of elected representatives and it will modernise the registration and electoral process in a way that is secure and using the most appropriate and up-to-date, modern technology.<\/p><p>The key recommendations in the report are as follows.  It recommends the establishment of an interim implementation body to oversee the implementation of the changes.  It recommends that the majority of seats be elected by popular vote in a &ldquo;one person one vote&rdquo; system.  This principle is recommended to be extended to include Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and those living overseas who hold a valid Irish passport.  The report recommends provision for online registration of voters and downloading of ballot papers.  It also recommends a greater role for the Seanad in the scrutiny, amendment and initiation of legislation and that there be a review of the panel system.  The group also produced a draft Bill to implement the relevant recommendations contained in its report.<\/p><p>I welcomed the report when it was published and said there needed to be a public and political discussion and consultation on it.  On 5 May and 8 July 2015, statements on the report were made in Seanad &Eacute;ireann with both the chair of the working group and former Senator Joe O'Toole, a member of the group, in attendance.  I also met Opposition party leaders to discuss the report's contents in July 2015.  Arising from this meeting, I gave a commitment to have a debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the working group's report at an appropriate time.  Although this did not prove possible in the last D&aacute;il, it is my intention that the debate should take place as soon as possible.  The D&aacute;il debate should be the first step in the reform process.<\/p><p>The working group recommended that the interim implementation body be established.  The programme for partnership Government makes a commitment to move forward with the reforms proposed by the working group.  This implementation group should be established in the Oireachtas and its membership should consist of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, from all parties and groups, with access to independent experts.  Yesterday, I wrote to the leaders of the parties suggesting that we move ahead with the establishment of the implementation group and, assuming they agree, I intend to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible so the reform agenda can be advanced.<\/p><p>The Seanad Bill 2016, sponsored by Senators Michael McDowell, Frances Black, Victor Boyhan, Gerard Craughwell, John Dolan, Joan Freeman, Alice-Mary Higgins, Colette Kelleher, R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, Grace O'Sullivan, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Lynn Ruane, aims to implement reforms proposed in the report of the working group.  This Bill commenced Second Stage in the Seanad on 13 July last and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, spoke on that occasion to give a broad outline of the Government's position on the various provisions contained therein.

After over a dozen reports on Seanad reform, it is now incumbent on the Taoiseach and the Government to meaningfully engage with the Seanad reform process.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Seanad 2016 Bill which implements the Manning report on Seanad reform.  The Bill is in keeping with our explicit commitments in our manifesto, An Ireland for All.  Fianna F&aacute;il was the only parliamentary party to oppose the abolition of the Seanad in 2013 and to set out detailed reform proposals at that time.  While affirming the importance and value of the Upper House, Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the need for expansive reform in the Seanad to revive its popular legitimacy and to restore its important role in the legislative process.  This stance has been supported by the recent report of the working group on Seanad reform, which echoes many of the recommendations made by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2014.<\/p> <p>One of the key points we made at that time, which were raised in the Manning report and which our leader was able to implement was appointing three Independent Senators.  We have been able to appreciate the value of the contributions these Senators have made to this Seanad.  The Bill draws on the Manning report and reflects much of previous 2014 Fianna F&aacute;il Bill in the area.  After 12 reports on Seanad reform, we now need real action not more idle talk.  This Bill provides a clear route forward to reform the Upper House.  It is vital that, following his failed campaign to abolish the Seanad, the Taoiseach should engage with he process in a meaningful fashion and ensure that the legislation passes through the D&aacute;il on this occasion.<\/p> <p>The outcome of the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU is hugely disappointing.  While we respect the views of the voters, we regard the outcome as a bad result for Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  What is now needed is a calm, stable and measured approach.  Our focus should be on showing that Ireland plans to remain a committed member of the EU, making Brexit an absolute priority in our public business, pushing for the unique position of Ireland to be recognised in negotiations and working to reform the EU so that it lives up to the principles upon which it was founded.<\/p> <p>The long-term outcome of this referendum for Ireland will most likely depend on the relationship that Britain establishes with the EU and the terms of such a relationship.  We must ensure that Ireland's interests are to the fore in any negotiations.  Britain is our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner and the implications for trade, travel, tourism other facets of life will be affected.  The uncertainty about borders is a huge concern for the whole island, with massive effects on trade and the agribusiness.  It is crucial that the Border is central to the negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.  We need political, economic and legal certainty as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>What does the Taoiseach hope to achieve with the all-Ireland forum and how does he plan to make it as inclusive as possible, given the Democratic Unionist Party's reluctance to participate?  Given that Brexit, when it eventually happens, could take many forms, how is the Taoiseach's Department planning for all of the possible scenarios?  What is the Taoiseach doing to convey to other member states that Ireland's position on Brexit is unique and distinct and that there is a need for sensitivity, particularly in respect of Northern Ireland?<\/p> <p>We have already seen the impact on the mushroom industry as a consequence of the referendum result, 90% of all mushrooms grown in Ireland are exported to the UK.  What efforts are being made to protect industries that are particularly vulnerable as a result of the Brexit vote?  What are our embassies doing to promote Ireland as a destination for business and to lessen our dependence on the EU market?<\/p> <p>In respect of the budget, what are the Taoiseach's plans to ensure that it is weighted in favour of those who have suffered most during recent years, particularly lone parents, the elderly and households with children?  Will he commit to restoring the Christmas bonus in the upcoming budget?  Why are there no Senators on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#Z00700","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach.  I am my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on housing and there are one or two issues about which I am very concerned.  We have had four months of meetings with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  Arising from those meetings, we have been told there is an 84-point action plan.  One of the only two results to emerge from those meetings is that the pre-planning and planning process will be hastened for local authorities that are building over 100 houses.  That is miles down the road and we are in a crisis.  The other result relates to the new housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, which is not working.  It is a rental scheme that all local authorities are introducing.  People are given more rent to help with their rent allowance but many landlords are increasing the rent with the result that there is no balance.  Unless these problems are addressed, we will not solve the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>In my local authority area, Carlow, there is a cap of &euro;27,500 and anyone who earns more than that does not qualify for the local authority housing list.  Every local authority has set up a new rent scheme and everybody has been reassessed.  Many of the people I deal with do not qualify for the local authority housing list and are becoming homeless.  We are not addressing the key issues to help people get homes.<\/p> <p>The new tenant purchase scheme introduced in the past four months allows only 50% of tenants to buy their houses.  The other 50% - either because they do not work, because they are in receipt of illness benefit or because they are retired - cannot qualify for this new scheme.  Apart from these two initiatives, what else on the 84-point plan has been done to help homeless people?<\/p> <p>The local authorities are preparing their budgets.  Carlow is very small.  The town council has been abolished and there have been extra costs for the land aggregation scheme for local authorities.  In addition, rates and utility payments from the local enterprise boards have been lost.  It is small county which cannot pass a budget because it does not have the proper funding coming in.  I have spoken to the Minister about this.  If a plan is not put in place to help the local authorities that require assistance, the ordinary Joe Soap on the road will suffer when library services, parks and road maintenance are cut.  We need to ensure that everybody gets fair play and that the Taoiseach will help the local authorities that come to him asking for help to reach some agreement.  I understand that it is very hard to give so much capital funding to local authorities but the Taoiseach needs to make an agreement with them because the working person will suffer the cuts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#Z00800","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#AA00100","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Ceart go leor.

T&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach go bhfuil spiorad nua ag teacht chun cinn sa Teach seo i dtaobh athch&oacute;iri&uacute; an tSeanaid as seo amach.  In his extensive speech, the Taoiseach covered many matters, including very important issues like Brexit and the future relationships between Ireland and the United Kingdom, and between the North and the South.  The one thing I would say in relation to all of that is that there are many domestic squalls surrounding this Government.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, it is in an unusual position.  I want to express my hope that the Government will keep a firm hand on the tiller.  Both the economic situation and the position with regard to public sector pay need to be kept under control.  We should not allow ourselves to be buffeted too much.<\/p> <p>I welcome a number of things the Taoiseach said about the reform of this House.  I welcome his reiterated support for the implementation of the Manning report and his commitment to making that happen.  I was particularly struck by two features of what the Taoiseach had to say.  The first relates to the formation of the implementation group.  Those who have read the Manning report will be conscious that it sets out ambitious reforms for the future conduct of elections to this House and the future business of this House.  Such reforms will require a huge amount of preparation and groundwork to be put in.  The extension of the franchise to citizens who are normally resident in Northern Ireland and citizens who live abroad will be a hugely ambitious task in a short timeframe.  I would like to say in that context that the Taoiseach's comments about getting a consensus in the D&aacute;il were very important too.  This Chamber is not the only one concerned with this issue.  We must ultimately have a broad consensus based not merely on what Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann think about how Senators should be elected in the future, but also on what the people of Ireland, through their public representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, think about the issue.<\/p> <p>When the Minister of State, Deputy English, came in here to respond to the debate on the Seanad reform Bill, he outlined in a robust enough way some of the difficulties that are implicit in these reforms.  Some people might have seen his remarks as throwing cold water on the matter.  I think they were an expression of the Government's desire to see us address this matter in a realistic way.  Given that many Members of this House have been well served by the current system, under which they were elected, it would be naive of us to think they would be universally enthusiastic about the adoption of a different system.  I emphasise that barring a miracle, the arrangements for the Manning report to be implemented in full will probably not be put in place in time for the next general election.  They may be put in place on the Statute Book, which is my hope.  From a practical perspective, a register of people in Northern Ireland will have to be compiled and voting arrangements will have to be extended to cover Irish citizens in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.  In such circumstances, it is highly unlikely that these arrangements will be fully operational in the near future.  I say that to underline the point that those who are reluctant to embrace change should realise that it will take time.  It is important to put the new arrangements on the Statute Book now so that they can be implemented with the backing of an Oireachtas implementation group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#AA00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach.  Irish people who live abroad are delighted that he appointed a Senator with a specific brief to advocate for their concerns, particularly with regard to the undocumented status of many of them.  Two weeks ago, I attended the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Harp and Shamrock Society in San Antonio.  I stayed directly across from the Alamo, where many Irish people died.  Twelve of those who died there were born in Ireland and a further 20 were of Irish descent.  Thirty of the 300 people who attended the event a fortnight ago were born in Ireland.  This shows how diverse the Irish community in that region is.  The same thing can be said of every state in the US.<\/p> <p>As the Taoiseach knows, the United States is less than 40 days away from a presidential election, the result of which will be as close as any in recent memory.  The Irish and immigrant rights community in the US is watching the race extremely closely, as opinions on immigration expressed by the two candidates could not be further apart in substance or tone.  I was in New York last week with the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh.  We met representatives of Irish community and immigration advocacy groups.  I assure the Taoiseach that they are already planning their responses to either a Trump or a Clinton victory in the forthcoming election and are preparing their strategies for the first 100 days of the next Presidency.<\/p> <p>The Irish community leaders I met in Ireland House asked me and the Irish Government to petition the next President of the US and the US Congress for new visas for the Irish.  They made the case that Ireland lost 18,000 visas a year under the 1965 immigration law, which today results in fewer than 350 green cards being issued to Irish people  I feel that the political will exists in Congress.  Irish people punch way above our weight.  Given that 10,500 visas were secured in a 2013 Senate Bill, I believe an Irish visa Bill could pass if the Irish Government joined forces with legislative allies on Capitol Hill and Irish community groups to make a major push.<\/p> <p>Irish companies now employ more Americans in the US than American companies employ here in Ireland.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, is very proud of his Irish roots and is a major advocate of immigration reform.  Will the Taoiseach, through his Ministers and the ambassador, make contact with the next President, whoever he or she may be, to ensure a visa Bill for the Irish is initiated?  I suggest that any visa Bill should also provide for a path for the undocumented Irish, who would not be averse to coming back to Ireland to secure such a visa at the US Embassy here if it were guaranteed that they could return to the US.<\/p> <p>I thank the Taoiseach for his commitment to the diaspora and to the issue of voting rights for immigrants abroad.  As the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, alongside Ambassador Anderson, noted in New York, we have a constitutional obligation to the Irish diaspora under the Good Friday Agreement.  This statement was wholeheartedly appreciated by the community leaders we met in America.  They also wondered about the Government's stance on the voting rights issue.  Can we expect that a referendum on this matter will be held and the result implemented in time for the 2018 Irish Presidential election?  The subject of immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish are of relevance to the process of Seanad reform that is currently under discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#AA00400","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#AA00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am glad he raised the issue of Brexit because I am interested in the Government's plans to protect the best interests of the entire island of Ireland.  We are about to enter an extremely difficult period for which there is no precedent.  We are now in the calm after the storm and before the next storm, when Article 50 will be triggered.  There is no timeline and, regrettably, there is not much hard evidence of planning on the Government's part.  We need to see the entire island being proactive, rather than waiting on the Tory Government to make the next move.  They created this crisis for their own selfish ends.  The Taoiseach should certainly not allow them to dictate how we respond or the pace.  It is now obvious that the Brexiteers had absolutely no plan.  We still do not know what they want.  We need the Taoiseach to work closely with the Northern Executive, with or without the support of the British Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Taoiseach should, when necessary, stand up for Ireland and confront the British Government, in the same way as the First Minister of Scotland, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, is doing.  I welcome Ms Sturgeon's moves.  Also, she has explicitly said that if the negotiations around Brexit are not to her satisfaction and the satisfaction of the Scottish National Party, SNP, she will consider another referendum on Scottish independence.<\/p><p>Mr. David Davis MP has been appointed as Brexit Minister in Britain.  Has the Taoiseach any plans for a Minister and Department here to deal with the fallout from Brexit and, indeed, to plan across all Departments here, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which will be crucial in the Brexit issue?  Not a day goes by without a new forecast or concern raised regarding the possible impact of the decision by English voters to leave the EU.  I say \"English voters\" because the people in the North of Ireland voted to remain in the EU.  We need a dedicated individual and support staff to formulate responses and come up with solutions in what looks to be a challenging few years ahead.  It is vital that the Taoiseach takes personal responsibility to impress upon the British Government that their wishes should be respected.  I get the sense that the Government is dealing with all of this as a done deal and we in Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to press for the rights of those who consciously voted to remain part of the EU.<\/p><p>I also want to find out whether the Taoiseach, since he was returned in April last, has been listening to the concerns of people.  We had thousands of people on the streets again last week over the water charges.  They are clearly saying that the water charges should go forever.  This means the charges being eliminated.  It is time to give up the ghost on the water issue.  People will not be fooled into paying their hard-earned money to keep Irish Water in the lifestyle to which it has become accustomed.  All the while, we see the purchase of Siteserv and, indeed, the non-implementation of the Moriarty tribunal findings become centre-stage in American politics around the US presidential election.  It reflects badly on us, as a country.<\/p><p>I will turn briefly to the Apple issue.  There is considerable public concern at the Government's refusal of the &euro;13 billion.  My party and I think we are missing a real opportunity for the Taoiseach, as leader of this country, to hold his hands up and come clean.  This is a real opportunity for the Taoiseach to admit that we have for several decades knowingly facilitated tax evasion and tax avoidance on a significant scale.  We are not the only country to have done this.  Billions of euro have been lost to people all over the world but we are leading the charge in it.  The Taoiseach's Government and particularly the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government have formulated policy to deprive Irish citizens of billions of euro due to this State from multinational companies.  The Taoiseach, with Fianna F&aacute;il, has given away our natural resources, our oil and gas and our fishing industry, and our seaweed industry is even about to be given away.<\/p><p>Nobody is saying we should not do everything we can to encourage inward investment and job creation from multinationals, and indeed they are welcome to be here.  Our 12.5% corporation tax rate is highly competitive.  Our educated English-speaking workforce and many other factors make this an attractive place to do business.  Do we not owe it to the hundreds of thousands who have been forced to emigrate, those children who are not allowed on the school bus, those children and families who are homeless, those elderly and sick patients lying on hospital trolleys, those children with special needs, those with disabilities, those parents crippled by the cost of child care, those on low wages and zero-hour contracts and those farm and fishing families whose incomes have been eroded to have a fair fiscal policy that will drive a fairer distribution of wealth in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#AA00900","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>An uair deireanach a bh&iacute; an Taoiseach agus m&eacute; f&eacute;in os comhair a ch&eacute;ile, bh&iacute;omar i bparl&uacute;s an ardmh&eacute;ara i mB&eacute;al Feirste.

The Taoiseach, I need not remind him, has a clear obligation to stand up for the best interests of Ireland in her entirety.  He has a mandate from the people in the North that is clear in the people's ambition and aspiration to stay and to keep Ireland in her entirety in the EU.<\/p> <p>Mura miste leis an Taoiseach, labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; fosta faoi chearta v&oacute;t&aacute;la i dtoghch&aacute;in uachtar&aacute;nachta.  It has been rightly referred to by Senator Lawless, in terms of the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, earlier this year, that a referendum would be sought to be held early next year to extend the franchise of presidential voting rights to the diaspora.  That is the proper thing to do.  It is in line with the best practice of other states and countries around the world.  I want to know if, as outlined clearly by the Constitutional Convention and by a broad range of civic and political opinion in the North, the same enfranchisement and democratic right will be afforded to me and to the hundreds of thousands of people like me in the North who are Irish citizens and who wish to vote for their President, who of course is not the President of a land mass but the President of the Irish people in their entirety as well.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can confirm for me, without pre-empting the outcome of a referendum, although I would be reasonably confident heading in to one, that when that referendum is held, it will not only seek to extend the democratic right to vote in presidential elections to the diaspora but will also include Irish citizens north of the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#BB00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach go Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

We are also looking at a Seanad &Eacute;ireann unlike any other because this Seanad, the Twenty-fifth Seanad, is the first which was saved from abolition by a popular vote of the Irish people.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me and support me in recognising that, in the people being sovereign, as he himself recognised, those who voted to retain the Seanad in 2013 were voting for reform.  When we spoke about a new relationship between the Irish people and their Parliament, they were voting explicitly for the right to have a relationship, both in how this Chamber is elected and in the work that it conducts.  I strongly support the advance in the area of Seanad &Eacute;ireann reform and I very much welcome the commitments the Taoiseach has given today in terms of recognising the Manning report, the valuable work that has been done there, the importance of the proposals, and the transformative and positive nature of many of those proposals within the Manning report.

If we wish to drive forward meaningful Seanad reform and deliver it to the people before the next time we have an election, we need to ensure we do not take any backward steps and that we continue to move forward with that Bill while discussing the implementation together.  I would like the Taoiseach's assurances in that regard.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach also spoke of budgetary scrutiny and the new process, and I have a question for him on a specific commitment in that regard.  Something I would strongly welcome is the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government on equality and gender-proofing.  This is something I and many others, certainly during my time with the National Women's Council, were happy to campaign and press for, and I am delighted to see that it is part of the Taoiseach's commitment.  I would like the Taoiseach to outline how he sees the equality and gender-proofing aspects of the budget being delivered, both in budget 2017 and in the future.  Will there be an equality statement to accompany the budget, as is the practice in Scotland?  I believe it is important that tax measures, including tax reliefs, are also included within that equality budgeting process, and this is something it would be useful to hear assurance on as well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I reiterate the point made by others that we need to be realistic when we talk about tax in Ireland.  We need to be real on the figures.  When we talk about corporate tax practices, we have to be real.  When we talk about tax concessions, the language we use is important.  In that regard, we need a reality check.  I urge the Taoiseach to give leadership in the discussion around what the squeezed middle actually is.  The fact is that the median earning income in Ireland is &euro;28,500.  Half of all workers in Ireland are earning that amount or less.  They cannot be invisible.  We need to ensure that this entire 50% of workers is not invisible in the discussion around the budget.  What they need is real investment in wages that are quality wages, work that is quality work, real increases in pay and public services.  Investing in public services is the way to give back to and benefit the full population.  Ireland has a role also in making the case for public investment in public services at European level.<\/p><p>I make a special appeal in relation to care.  Care is the lifeblood of our society and should be recognised in all of our economic processes, including in our summer economic statement and economic dialogues.  That would be transformative not only in relation to child care but also in terms of home care and the question of statutory entitlements.  We have heard Ministers say they do not want the budget to appear regressive.  It must not be regressive and that must be tested.  Further to the question of equality proofing, guidelines were issued by the Department of the Taoiseach to all Departments on their new three-year statements of strategy.  It is unfortunate that the guidelines have not drawn attention to the public sector duty on equality and human rights.  It is important for the Taoiseach to provide leadership to Departments to ensure that they are aware of their duties in that regard.  I would like to have statements in the House as to how those guidelines might be amended to include clear reference to that public duty.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach represented the State at the highest level in signing the Paris climate change commitments and the sustainable development goals.  In the past, we have also signed up to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It would be appropriate to remind Departments of those key commitments on which the Taoiseach has led and which apply across government and to ensure that those commitments are reflected in the departmental strategies for the next three years.  Ireland played a key role in the negotiations around the sustainable development goals, which should be commended strongly.<\/p><p>Ireland also played a key role in the recent summit on refugees.  At UN level, Ireland is playing a key role in moving these discussions forward.  However, we must also show leadership within Europe where the EU-Turkey deal is not acceptable and the human rights of refugees are in the balance.  Leadership must also be shown within Ireland where, sadly, our already inadequate commitment to take 4,000 refugees has seen us receive only 400.  I know those figures are moving, but this is an area in which we can lead.  The outcome of the summit was a call to all countries to do what they can.  I believe we can and should do much more.  We must also look at our direct provision system and the right to work.  We must examine the way refugees are treated within Ireland.  We must also send those positive signals because of the danger of the xenophobic language which drove so much of the Brexit debate.  That is why we must send positive signals and messages of inclusion.<\/p><p>On Brexit, I welcome the all-Ireland conversation.  Other Members have spoken to the important issues but, crucially, we must not engage in any race to the bottom on conditions in relation to Brexit.  We must look to opportunities such as investment in higher education.  In terms of the future of Europe, we can be strong European citizens while also being critical.  We must be strong in areas like trade and on the CETA agreement which the Government seems intent, unfortunately, on signing this very month.  At a time of uncertainty and when we are talking about responsibility, it would be reckless for the Government to agree to the provisional application of this trade agreement with its immense implications.<\/p><p>I do not have a chance to make my other points, but I look forward to the overall debate.  I say to the Taoiseach that while the citizens' assembly is welcome as a discussion, it is not a sufficient response to the demands from international bodies or from the street.  People want a chance to vote through the ballot box.  We need a referendum to repeal, not replace, the eighth amendment.  I hope a date for that referendum can be set within the lifetime of this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#BB00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Kevin Humphreys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#CC00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I welcome him back to the Seanad.  I am glad to hear of his commitment to Seanad reform now that the question of abolition is firmly off the table.  As others have said, we have a blueprint for reform in the shape of the Manning report and I note that the Taoiseach has expressed his support for it.  We need to see action, however, and a timeframe for the implementation of the recommendations.<\/p> <p>As the Labour Party's spokesperson on foreign affairs, I have a number of issues to raise with the Taoiseach, the first of which is Brexit.  We have already spoken a great deal about Brexit and the Taoiseach has addressed it himself.  I welcome the stated Government priorities and the announcement of an all-island dialogue.  We passed a motion in the Seanad in July mandating ourselves to have a comprehensive dialogue and debate in this Chamber calling in, among others, MEPs and Northern Ireland's First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  I hope we will contribute to the debate.  We must look at creative ways of moving forward.  I had an interesting meeting with Alex Salmond MP earlier today and we spoke about the possibility of a separate legal status for Northern Ireland and Scotland in the wake of Brexit negotiations based, for example, around the Lichtenstein model.  We must look at all the options as we move forward in the process.<\/p> <p>On our relations with the EU more generally, I noted with interest the Taoiseach's speech in Bratislava.  While it is important to commend him for his emphasis on our neutrality, I note the need to hold the line on that in particular in light of Jean-Claude Juncker's speech calling for a centralised common defence policy in Europe.  We need to ensure we take a strong stance in defence of our own neutrality.<\/p> <p>On the question of refugees which others have mentioned, I welcomed very much the commitment of the previous Government to welcome 4,000 refugees from Syria and through the European hot spots in Greece and Italy.  However, I am very concerned by the slow pace of progress, which has been noted by the T&aacute;naiste in recent weeks.  Can we expedite the process to ensure that more refugees are brought in and can we see the implementation of the recommendations of the Mahon report on the reform of direct provision, which was a priority of the former Minister of State, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in?  I received an e-mail update today from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res describing the appalling situation in Aleppo and the very large number of civilians who face siege in rebel held areas under bombardment from the Syrian Government and Russia.  The 250,000 people in question have access to only approximately 30 doctors.  The USA announced today that it will take a much stronger stance against Russia and I would like to think that Ireland would take a role within the EU to press for a similar stance given the apparent abandonment by Russia of the peace process.<\/p> <p>On an issue closer to home, I ask with other Members that the momentum for the repeal of the eighth amendment be recognised within our political system.  I am glad the Taoiseach spoke of the plan for a citizens' assembly which I hope will recommend a referendum for repeal.  When will that be held?  Can we have a very clear timeframe for the process of referral of recommendations to the Oireachtas committee and then to the D&aacute;il and Seanad?  The momentum is clear and we need to see the repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#CC00400","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is very welcome.

The level of the debate so far today has been very good and informative and I very much welcome that.<\/p> <p>I do not think politicians, like the media, have short memories.  The reason I ran the campaign to have the Taoiseach attend today was that the terms \"new politics\" and \"reform\" were dripping from everyone's tongue.  Nobody knew or understood exactly what was meant, however.  I was hoping the Taoiseach would put some meat on those bones here today but, unfortunately, I have seen very little of that.  What I see constantly are the major decisions of the day being kicked to either committees, reviews or mediation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One of the ones which drove me absolutely demented was when there was an undermining of collective Cabinet responsibility.  I very much support the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment, but Deputy Mick Wallace's Bill was clearly unconstitutional.  How it was wrangled around to allow people to vote against it was that the Attorney General's advice was not sought by Cabinet, but I do not find that right.  One of the Minister's that did not seek the Attorney General's advice was very glad of her advice when he was rushing back from Rio and found himself in severe trouble out there.  <br\/><br\/>We had an interesting discussion this morning when Senators McDowell and Norris referred to delays in the appointment of judges, and asked where the real responsibility lies.  We read in various newspapers that a particular Minister will veto the appointment of judges, which raises questions about collective Cabinet responsibility.  Whether or not it is true, it was said he went to the papers and announced he was going to veto it.  I find that very difficult to accept.  <br\/><br\/>I wish to raise two issues that are close to my heart.  I raised one of those issues yesterday, namely, the co-location of Holles Street hospital at St. Vincent's Hospital.  One of those issues was kicked to a mediator in the hope of finding a result.  When the Minister attended this House he said: &quot;I have no plan B.&quot;  If St. Vincent's, Elm Park, does not agree to it, it is scuttered and, therefore, 10,000 babies are born in Holles Street hospital in overcrowded conditions and in ten delivery wards when there should be over 20.<br\/><br\/>An article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning reports that the State is still owed over &euro;240 million by religious institutions.  I suggest that if we cannot get agreement on the co-location of Holles Street hospital at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, as part of the compensation to taxpayers and the State, the religious order involved should hand that hospital back to the HSE to manage it.  Let us build a good quality hospital that the women and children of this State deserve.  That would be a fitting legacy.<br\/><br\/>I constantly hear that the Rural Alliance and different Independents hold the strings of power over this Government.  It is driving a wedge between rural and urban Ireland.  However, parts of Dublin, Cork and Limerick have suffered equally from this recession.  Such areas have also lost Garda stations and post offices.  There are huge areas of disadvantage across Dublin that urgently require investment.  All disadvantaged areas, whether rural or urban, deserve to share in the recovery.<br\/><br\/>The sum of &euro;20 million for reinvigorating rural towns is badly needed, but urban areas have suffered equally.  They include Dublin's inner city which was kicked to a task force.  We need decisions and leadership.  Even though it is a minority Government, we cannot let small groups derail the recovery.  I am not only talking about economic recovery, but also about the social recovery of communities, schools, hospitals and infrastructure.  I ask the Taoiseach not to be misdirected by small vocal groups that are only looking after their parishes.  The interests of this country need to be looked after.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#CC00700","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Senator O'Donnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#DD00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

His address has highlighted many key issues.  Listening to some of the comments in the House today, I am reminded that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  I will not go into the parish pump issues that have been addressed either directly or indirectly. <\/p> <p>The themes addressed by the Taoiseach highlight the fragility faced by the world and by Ireland within the EU, whether it concerns Brexit or our own existence in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, including how we are elected.  Other issues include the budget and the country's economic outlook within the EU, the eighth amendment, the pressing issue of housing, and the Government's approach to how it governs.  That requires leadership and a holistic approach by Members of the Oireachtas.  I am confident that under the Taoiseach's leadership, the programme for Government, which is committed to a just society based on a resilient economy, will be achieved.  Those who naval gaze should look at how far the country has come in the five short years that Deputy Enda Kenny has been Taoiseach.  Unemployment has fallen, our economy is growing and the public finances are secure.  We have seen profound change in the social lives of many people, and some of us are now more equal than we were.  <\/p> <p>When I hear people talking about Apple, I ask them to visit Cork city or other areas where thousands of people are directly employed by multinationals or in ancillary services.  Our country is viewed around the world as one whose economy is growing and people are employed at home.  We are welcoming home our returning emigrants today. <\/p> <p>Earlier today, together with Senator Lawless, I met the Governor of Michigan.  We had discussions about attracting people to invest here, which will have a positive outcome.  Challenges remain, including Brexit, public service pay and other demands.  However, we can see how a growing economy benefits many people with the fruits of that being invested in our country. <\/p> <p>The budget in October will probably be the most important one we have ever faced as a nation.  We should deal with it prudently and based on how we can improve people's lives in a tangible and meaningful way.  It is important to improve people's lives but in so doing there is a duty on all of us to recognise that the Government does not have a pot of gold to float every boat and make everyone happy.<\/p> <p>The changed political landscape presents us with a challenge because no party has a majority.  I wish to thank all Members of this House for their co-operation and willingness to work together in a spirit that has seen us do business better and differently.  I commend all Senators for that.  I refer in particular to Senator Lawless as a member of the diaspora and a citizen of this country.  Having visited America during the summer, I know that his work is having an impact.  I wish him well in his continuing endeavours.  Some people criticised and questioned his appointment, but I know from talking to members of the Irish diaspora in the United States that they see his appointment as an important one that values their work.  This concerns not only the undocumented Irish, but also the efforts to bring people home to work here, as well as bringing investment to our country.<\/p> <p>In his remarks, the Taoiseach spoke about leaving nobody behind.  This is a partnership Government and it is important that that partnership reaches beyond the Cabinet room or D&aacute;il Chamber and is also extended to this House.  Seanad reform was agreed in the programme for Government.  As Leader of the House, I welcome the opportunity to work with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy English, other Ministers and all sides of the House to bring about reform.<\/p> <p>As a former Chairman of a committee, I recognise the importance of bringing Oireachtas reform to the people.  The committee system is the most pivotal part of what we do in this House, yet it gets lost in the cauldron of debate in both Chambers.  Nonetheless, the committee system has demonstrated that it can work quite well on behalf of the people.<\/p> <p>As Leader of this House, I am committed to bringing in a second Private Members' motion which we discussed briefly yesterday at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Seanad consultation committee has been re-established.  It is important to reach beyond the gates of Leinster House to the communities we serve and those whom we represent.  They say that Senators do not have a constituency, but we are here to work on behalf of the people.  As Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, we must go beyond the gates to reach out to the public.  I hope the Seanad consultation committee can do so again.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Thanks to the initiative of Senator O'Donnell, we will have a continuing Brexit debate.  I look forward to working with the Taoiseach on the implementation body to bring Seanad reform, whatever it brings, to the Upper House.  It is important that we continue, collectively, to bring reform of the Seanad to fruition.<\/p><p>I will speak to the issue of the citizens' assembly.  As somebody who served on the Constitutional Convention and chaired the health committee dealing with the protection of life during pregnancy legislation, I very much welcome the establishment of a citizens' assembly.  I spoke in the House yesterday about the benefits of it and the need to be temperate in our language when we approach what is a very sensitive topic.  Equally, we must empower the citizens' assembly so it can do its work and bring forward its report.  We should give it our support as Members of this House.  The ten-year health strategy is important and we all hope it will be successful and we can sign up to it.  It is disappointing that no Members of this House have yet been appointed to the group discussing the strategy.  In this House we have experts in the health area who are willing to engage and be part of that process.<\/p><p>As the Taoiseach stated, we cannot go back to the old days.  We are ambitious for ourselves and our people in this House.  The Taoiseach and his Government are the same.  I commend the Taoiseach on his work and wish him well in the endeavours he will continue.  I hope the people will continue to see increased employment and consequent benefits to all our lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#DD00400","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House and wish him well.  I will touch on two key elements dealt with by the Taoiseach in his address.  The first is Brexit, and as the Leader mentioned, we will hold our own debate on the issue.  I very much welcome the Taoiseach's call for an all-Ireland dialogue.  The Good Friday Agreement has passed its 18th birthday - the age of consent - and I hope people will see that the agreement has evolved over time, with a natural progression now being an all-Ireland dialogue on Brexit because it has implications both North and South, particularly in the economic sphere.  We could have a common approach in viewing Brexit.<\/p><p>The second issue is our interaction with Europe.  There is much talk that Ireland, as such, has no direct role in the Brexit negotiations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the UK and Europe.  Ireland very much has a role in the navigation, as it wants to ensure our trade links with Britain are maintained.  The UK is our largest trading partner and we have many common bonds.  There is a specific role for the Taoiseach, acting on behalf of the Republic, to assist in a way that will ensure we can have safe passage through choppy waters.<\/p><p>If there was ever a manifestation of a reason somebody should be appointed to the Seanad, it is the example of Senator Lawless's contribution on emigrants.  He raised new themes and issues today relating to the diaspora.  I would like to see the measures fast-tracked, as the diaspora is a major issue.  We all have family living in America and Senator Lawless spoke specifically about the US.

I welcome the Taoiseach to the House and I also welcome his remarks on Seanad reform.  I have been campaigning for Seanad reform for 40 years and I hammered out some of the well-known phrases about the Seanad over those 40 years.  I contributed to every report published during the 30 years I have spent here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Seanad Bill introduced by Senator McDowell was cobbled together by lawyers hired by Mr. Feargal Quinn.  I recommend that the Taoiseach look at the detailed forensic critique which I subjected it to in this House.  One of the issues - a parochial matter, I suppose - is the defence of the Trinity constituency.  I point out to the Taoiseach that it is the longest surviving parliamentary constituency on this island, going back to the beginning of the 17th century.  It must be respected.<\/p> <p>As father of the House, I ask the Taoiseach if he would grant me the privilege of a ten-minute interview.  I have suggestions to make about Seanad reform.  They are not pick-and-mix or about referring issues to committees.  It is a really radical and visionary approach that would get the Taoiseach an additional footnote in history.  The partisan element of the process bedevils the Seanad.  It should be removed but it will require vision.  Very few politicians are prepared to relax their control or their power but a Seanad should essentially be an adviser and accomplice to the Government, lending support based on a fully professional approach.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach should forget about all the committees, etc.  Why not grasp the nettle and really go for a referendum?  We are having a referendum on something to do with the presidency, votes in America and so on, so why not grasp the nettle and have a referendum focused entirely on removing the party political element of the Seanad?  It would also entail removing the Taoiseach's option of nominating 11 Members.  In a non-confrontational and advisory Seanad composed entirely of professional people - the greatest brains of social reformers and people involved with the community - there would be no need for the controversy involved in wanting to defeat the Government or introduce party-oriented reforms.<\/p> <p>I ask for an opportunity to speak with the Taoiseach and give him details of this proposal.  There were suggestions of tinkering earlier.  There was a suggestion of opening the university seats to 1 million potential voters, leaving 1,000 voters to decide the other 43 panel seats and one vote - that of the Taoiseach - for 11 Members.  That is just absurd and does not really amount to reform.  Could I have the opportunity at some stage in the Taoiseach's very busy schedule to discuss these matters?  I can provide a blueprint in advance of any such meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#EE00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  He stated that as a result of Brexit, the European Union must prepare for a united Ireland.  There is a severe issue between North and South because of Brexit, and it will be detrimental on both sides of the Border if there is not a good result for the UK that could lead to a positive result for Ireland.  In many instances, people do not realise there are more Border crossings between the North and South of Ireland than between the European Union and all the countries to the east of it, a border ten times the size of the one between the North and South of this island.  There are 30,000 people per day commuting between the North and South.  There are 1 million litres of milk coming across the Border to be processed in both jurisdictions.  The knock-on effect of a hard Border or any restrictions on trade or people would have a detrimental effect on the North and South.

The Taoiseach has made some great appointments but of them all, that nomination is important because Senator Lawless will be able to speak for the Irish overseas in the United States and throughout the world.  Fianna F&aacute;il produced the first policy paper by any political party on the Irish overseas and the diaspora.  When one considers how many years this State has been in existence, the fact it took nearly 80 years for any political party to produce a policy paper specifically for the Irish overseas and the diaspora does not bode well for our treatment of them.  However, I do not merely refer to the undocumented in the United States but one key area of concern must be the forgotten Irish in England who left this country in hard economic times, worked hard and sent back money to their families, friends and relations but who have now fallen on hard times themselves.  They are people we must look after and I ask the Taoiseach to so do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#EE00700","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is welcome to the House and it is a great pleasure to address him here today.  I thank him for his attendance.  I first wish to join my colleagues on the nomination of Senator Lawless.  I was one of the first people who was sceptical about it, even though I knew Senator Lawless was a good Galway man.  It took a brave Mayo man to bring in a Galway man.  The Mayo men came down the Curragh Line with their shoes under their arms - saving them for the big town - but we will forgive them that.  Senator Lawless was a great and brave nomination by the Taoiseach for which I congratulate him.<\/p> <p>The Government is now facing an unprecedented industrial relations crisis and a new approach is necessary to overcome these issues.  The Government must realise or understand that it cannot continue to expect workers to live in income poverty and not encounter industrial unrest.  There must be an admission that the recovery message, which was oversold for all intents and purposes, created unrealistic expectations given the economic uncertainty still facing the country.  Unions cannot be expected to support the recovery unless there is honest discourse, which I would describe as full transparency, with respect to the finances of the State.  Different figures are being bandied about all the time, which creates a level of expectation Members are aware cannot be fulfilled.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to state they got it wrong with respect to the amount or level of recovery there was.  We are in recovery - the Taoiseach is to be congratulated for that - but the level of recovery does not support the expectations in the country.  Once this admission is made, we can then move on to an understanding of realistic margins within which the budget must operate for the security of workers.<\/p> <p>The Government must also admit the current hard-nosed approach to the talks regarding the Lansdowne Road agreement is not working.  As a country, we are at risk of repeating the worst mistakes of our recent past in which we agreed national pay deals and then agreed a series of side deals and special measures on top of that, which makes a farce of the entire approach.  The current industrial unrest can no longer be kept at bay and this requires a strong overarching solution.  We need a social partnership again that embraces all and brings everybody on board.  It is not enough to ignore some of those unions that have difficulty with the Lansdowne Road agreement while others are mindful of the state of the nation's purse.  The Government must reconvene the Lansdowne Road talks and give all unions, whether part of the current deal or not, the opportunity for a renewed chance to put their case on the table.  The Government must come to this in an open an honest fashion; admitting it exaggerated the amount of money it had, and with transparent figures on what might be possible.  Out of this, a new and overarching deal must be established to bring an end to the current unrest.<\/p> <p>We are at risk of ten years of industrial unrest unless we do something.  I believe the Taoiseach's previous Government gave leadership and I believe the trade unions will respond to him positively.  I ask the Taoiseach to revisit the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Let us go back at it and let us get all the unions under the umbrella at the same time.  I ask the Taoiseach to take that on board and again thank him for listening to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#FF00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>T&aacute; tr&iacute; n&oacute;im&eacute;ad ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#FF00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt.

However, I am afraid that in Galway, being the fourth largest city, people are disappointed at the difficulties they face and that more has not been done under the Taoiseach's watch for the people of Galway.  There is a massive crisis in the respect of the accident and emergency service.  The Taoiseach visited in 2015 and stated the accident and emergency unit in University Hospital Galway was not fit for purpose but 33 people are still on trolleys in that unit today.  I have asked the Minister for Health to consider the possibility of building a new hospital in Galway.  While he is completely non-committal, I ask the Taoiseach to commit to at least giving consideration to that proposal now that senior clinicians in Galway are calling for it.<\/p> <p>As for the traffic issue in Galway, where the former Minister for Health who is now a Member of this House once got stuck and was obliged to walk to meetings in the city, it is in absolute chaos and nothing really has been done to address that.  Moreover, the homelessness crisis in Galway is absolutely diabolical with 56 families and 133 children left homeless this year.  Galway and the west of Ireland need a much stronger focus from the Taoiseach to bring us back to where we need to be.<\/p> <p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.

The Taoiseach should be aware there were hundreds of nurses outside Leinster House on the reconvening of the D&aacute;il to welcome him back after the recess.  The issue is about increments and the injustice of the increments for the intern students from 2011 to 2015.  While this was agreed on by the Government, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, HSE, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has reneged on it, does not really wish to listen and is not responding and consequently, I appeal to the Taoiseach.

Disability comes to every door and has a couple of hallmarks.  It drives people into poverty and causes exclusion and these twin imposters conspire in a potent way to ensure people's hope and possibilities for the future are diminished.  Ireland can and must work against these twin evils.  In budget 2017, the Taoiseach has the modest but significant resources to make a strong start in respect of this matter.<\/p> <p>Disability wreaks havoc in every community and group: urban and rural, among children, young people, adults and older people, as well as among poor people, those at risk of poverty, the squeezed middle and those who are well off.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It does not spare any such categories.  The Taoiseach has committed to ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the end of this year and to commence strong implementation.  I ask the Taoiseach and his Government - and he has the choice to do this - to develop a good, robust social infrastructure that will underpin our economy and serve all the people when they have needs.  Something like 50,000 or 60,000 people who are not disabled today will be disabled by this day next year.  It is something that comes to every one of us.  We know this in our own lives.<\/p><p>A good start in 2017 is vital after the years of difficulty that we have had.  The Taoiseach should harness the resources of his Government and Cabinet and get to grips with this terrible dilemma, this running sore.  Areas such as health and community services, income supports, cost of disability payment, employment and housing are the issues that will have to be tackled in faith when we sign.  The Taoiseach will ratify with his signature the UN convention within the next couple of months.  To do that with confidence and strength, he should make a good start in the budget.  If he marshals &euro;300 million of the almost &euro;700 million available to him around this area, he will distribute and triage much-needed support for people and families all over this country.  Restoration needs to happen across our public service.  This is a potent way to do it.  Michael Corbett was laid to rest today.  It is our job not to rest until people with disabilities can take their full place in the values and participation in this republic of ours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#FF00700","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  In fairness to the leader, Senator Buttimer, it is incumbent on us in this House to work together to try to solve problems, a few of which I want to raise with the Taoiseach in my short contribution.  Senator Ruane and I work in the drugs area and want to have good engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.  Senators Kelleher and Mac Lochlainn and I, who work on the Traveller ethnicity issue, hope to get good co-operation from the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  However, I must ask the Taoiseach about the issue of direct provision and my contribution will be solely on that issue.<\/p> <p>In this House, when I was Minister of State, there was uniformity of opinion on the issue of direct provision.  I see Senator Conway, who is one of the most vocal on it, in front of me.  We came to speak with one voice and the need for action on it.  A report was commissioned.  At the time the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I worked very hard to commission that report.  We worked to implement it.  It was said on national radio last week that of the 2,000 people in direct provision over five years, as a direct result of that report, 1,500 are no longer in direct provision, which is a good day's work.<\/p> <p>However, the draft programme for Government that was released had a commitment to implement the McMahon report, which took nine months to put together.  It was compiled by NGOs and Department officials, so when it was signed off on, the assumption was that it would be implemented.  To my horror and to other people's horror, that sentence regarding the implementation of the McMahon report was dropped from the actual programme for Government.  I therefore ask the Taoiseach, because of the nature of the vulnerability of the families and children living in direct provision, that we implement that report.  We are not asking for a new report.  We are not asking for action to be taken which has not been already cited.  We are asking that the Taoiseach give a commitment to implement the report, which was commissioned by the Department with officials from many different Departments and NGOs in good faith and which has been published and was being implemented.  The Minister of State was here and was not in a position to give the commitment that it would be implemented.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is not in a position to say that she will implement it.  I would love if the Taoiseach could stand here today in this House and make such a commitment to the Members who collectively, in a cross-party manner - this is not a divisive issue in this House - are all committed to the implementation of the report.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach stood as a proud Irishman in the D&aacute;il and spoke in a tearful way of the issue of the Magdalen women.  He was commended for doing so.  I commended him - we all did - because it was an emotional day for everybody in the Oireachtas.  However, I am fully convinced there will be a Taoiseach in 20 or 30 years' time who will have to make a similar apology over the issue of direct provision.  It is within the Taoiseach's gift today to stand in front of us as a collective and say: \"I, as Taoiseach, will oversee or insure that the McMahon report will be implemented.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#GG00200","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I join in the welcome to the Taoiseach and in the recognition of the exemplary leadership he has given this country in getting our people back to work, restoring our public finances and now setting about rebuilding a normal society.<\/p> <p>I want to address the Brexit issue.  If I may, I will address it on a micro level first.  In the context of the budget and governmental policies in the short term, there are a number of businesses and industries, notably in the agricultural sector - the mushroom industry being highlighted - that are suffering hugely because of the fluctuation in the value of sterling.  Jobs will be dislocated in these sectors if we do not do something to help such sectors.  Ultimately, that would involve a social welfare bill and a loss of dignity for people, which is not a correct policy.  I therefore ask the Taoiseach, in the context of the budget and flexibility within the taxation system, that an effort be made to address the difficulty of sectors hit by the fluctuation in sterling in this budget and in the future.<\/p> <p>On a broader level, regarding Brexit, I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach wants to have an all-Ireland dialogue.  It is so important, and it was mentioned earlier, not only that there is a recognition that the people of Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU, but also that there is a national approach to this because we do not want a return to a hard Border.  We want free movement of people, services and goods right across this island and we want a normal society to continue here.  The Taoiseach's attempt to achieve consensus nationally in that regard is great.<\/p> <p>Regarding the arrangement with the UK, we need the UK to have a kind of Norwegian model.  I know that the Taoiseach cannot personally or directly influence this but perhaps he can create conditions or assist to create conditions that would lead to it.  We need the UK to maintain as many links and as much business and movement of goods, people and services as possible, with a certain adaptation, as in the case of Norway, which would suit its particular needs.  We need as much normality as possible to continue after the result.<\/p> <p>In a budgetary context, the 9% VAT rate, which was revolutionary and was one of the great planks in restoring our economy, has now become very important.  The prognosis is that sterling will continue to fluctuate downward.  As sterling weakens, our UK visitors will have less spending power when they come here.  To attract tourism, our hotels and businesses need the 9% VAT rate.  In that context, I would be the first to support the view that has become common, anecdotally and otherwise, that hotels must measure up in the prices they are charging.  This is a Dublin issue specifically, but along the areas where I live it is very important just to keep the tourism sector alive.<\/p> <p>The fluctuation in the value of sterling is a real issue right along the Border and right across the agricultural sector, particularly in intensive agriculture.  We could lose jobs and a whole lot of progress there.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to see how this could be headed off in the budget.  It should be borne in mind that the ultimate cost of allowing a collapse in these sectors, which I know he does not want to see happen, is enormous in terms of social welfare, health and societal problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016092900002#GG00300","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1475141400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>A number of people are offering to speak but I cannot fit them all in, so rather than start the rounds again, I ask the Taoiseach to respond.

Our strategy is to have a ten-year focus on health.<\/p><p>I was asked when the citizens' assembly would report on the eighth amendment.  It is the first issue with which Ms Justice Laffoy and the 99 citizens will deal.  Obviously, I expect the recommendations or whatever report is produced to be available to the Oireachtas probably fairly early in 2017.  I cannot put a date on it because I am not in a position to direct that the assembly has it back by a particular date.  It is important that ordinary citizens be entitled to have their say at a public forum in respect of an issue which has divided Irish society for well over 30 years.  I look forward to the engagement and participation of people from throughout the country, and various groups will have their say.  It will eventually come back to the Oireachtas.  I cannot give a date as to when the assembly will report, but it is the first item with which it will deal.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell referred to public pay.  This is a serious issue.  Having gone through budgets since 2011, I know just how desperate the situation has been and still is in many cases.  I take on board Senator McDowell's words.  We are not going to blow the Irish economy off the rails on which the people have put it in recent years through their hard sacrifices and difficult political choices.  There is a finite pot of approximately &euro;1 billion and this has been set out by both Ministers.  It will be two to one in favour of public services as against taxation matters.  We must make choices that are based on fairness, equality and priority to try to improve the lives of people where we can.<\/p><p>In many cases, when I sit at the European Council table people look at Ireland in a very different way now and they see the growth rate and the deficit falling - to be eliminated by 2018.  They see employment at over 2 million for the first time since 2009 and they see the improvements.  However, there are challenges.  The Senator raised a very particular point on the follow through from the Haddington Road agreement and Lansdowne Road agreement, which is to end in 2017.  I am a realist, as everybody must be in this business.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is acutely aware that there must be an arrangement to follow on from the Lansdowne Road agreement in due course.  I will say no more about it now, except that the Minister is acutely aware of the importance of the public services in which people engage and the services they provide.  I hope that, in the current situation, people will involve themselves in the mechanisms of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, and that we continue to keep our country going in the direction it is now heading, which is for a rising economy with the capacity to spread its fruits throughout the land where they are needed, where there is inequality and where people have been left behind.<\/p><p>The north inner city is an issue on which I intend to prove the Government actually takes an interest and that an area that was neglected, left behind and in which there is not that equality of opportunity, can respond in such a way.  I have been there on many occasions.  There are very strong, resilient and persistent people living there who are committed to their families, their streets and their homes.  They do not want their area blackened by a small percentage of criminal gangs that involve themselves in power, money and territory with a ruthlessness that is savage in how it imposes itself on communities.  This is why the Garda has been given the resources and the opportunity to deal with this.  It is also why Mr. Kieran Mulvey is speaking to all of the groups.  We will receive his report in November and I hope we can deal with it and demonstrate that where community leaders and people want to get on with their lives, we are there to help them.  When I say \"we\", I mean everybody involved.  This is a cross-party issue and not a party-political one.<\/p><p>The question of education interests me.  We do not have the money to invest where we know we could.  We must look to the Cassells report.  We have shorter-term issues.  We have paternity leave and the second free preschool year.  We must deal with the question of child care costs and the particular issues involved.<\/p><p>I am concerned about the fragility of the European Union.  Thirty five or 40 years ago, a number of very strong leaders were recognised Europe but now we have a single, serious economic power.  For all of those years, it was a case of countries applying to join the European Union and now a country has decided to leave it.  I want Senators to understand that the European Commission has always been the body which has dealt with applications to join because it has had the experience and expertise available to it.  This is the first time a country is leaving and the Commission will still deal with the negotiations and discussions.  It will be the European Council which will make the ultimate decisions because its members are the elected leaders and Heads of Government of the countries involved.  There is fragility about the structure of Europe that needs to be focused on with clear political thinking and a picture of where we want to be in five, ten, 15 and 20 years time.<\/p><p>There are concerns about trade deals, but there is also the prize of being able to set down the standards for world trade for the next 50 years.  People should not be afraid of globalisation.  Socrates said he was not a citizen of Athens or a citizen of Greece but a citizen of the world.  It is more important now to understand the interdependence of people and the international aspect of who we are in Ireland and the impact our people make worldwide every day.  I am very proud of this.<\/p><p>We have the challenge of continuing to keep the country as a place that is attractive for foreign direct investment and that is recognised as being open for business.  We are first in the world for skilled labour and, according to some of the world reports, seventh in terms of competitiveness.  We have moved up this line and this is where we need to be.<\/p><p>The forthcoming budget on 11 October will contain Brexit-proofing in respect of issues that we know are important.  People have mentioned the industries under pressure, and some have already gone under, and currency fluctuations, which Senator Reilly mentioned, are an issue.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are examining this and the Minister is very cognisant of what it means.  It also means there is an issue in respect of price increases from some manufacturing exports to England.  These matters will impact on British consumers in due course.  This will be an issue.  It is right and proper that the Prime Minister should have the opportunity to reflect on the issues the United Kingdom has to focus on before Article 50 is triggered.  Otherwise we are into a complete mass of confusion.  We cannot have a fix at present on what the proposition is, as it is the legal right of the Prime Minister to move it.  When it is moved, Europe must respond on where it wants to be.  Believe me, the complications that will arise from this are absolutely complex.  We have had some initial reaction to this.<\/p><p>People have asked whether we have a plan here.  Long before the vote, we established a unit in the Department of the Taoiseach to examine the contingencies that might have to be dealt with.  There is a dedicated Cabinet committee.  I was asked about appointing a Minister.  This is bigger than one Ministry and we need everybody involved.  This is why I chair the Cabinet committee and bring in Ministers as necessary.  I have asked all Ministers to look in detail at what is involved in their Departments in so far as their counterparts in Northern Ireland are concerned.  The next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council will be held in November and this will be an issue.  I hope we will have held the first of a series of all-island discussions before then because it is important that the economic voice of Northern Ireland is also heard with regard to cross-Border activities.  It is very important that we hear all of these voices.  The North-South Ministerial Council is well able to deal with the politics and political discussion, but there are other voices that also need to be heard.<\/p><p>In respect of homelessness and housing, we have a &euro;5 billion programme that is unprecedented in its scale.  Some people remarked that not much is happening.  The plan was produced within the first 100 days.  The main aim with regard to family homelessness, which was set out in the action plan, is to ensure that by mid-2017, which is an ambitious target, commercial hotels will only be used in exceptionally limited circumstances to accommodate homeless families.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=580\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=580&amp;amp;pid=EndaKenny&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For instance, the &euro;200 million infrastructural fund that is being put in place is to open up sites that are held in public ownership but are not accessible.  There is an intense interest in this already and I believe that it will bring about an increased access to about 11,000 to 15,000 houses when they are built.<\/p><p>We also need new ways of thinking like the private sector building after the Dublin City Council voted in respect of the site at O'Devaney Gardens, which is a massive operation.  Bigger companies, where they are publicly quoted, have a capacity to have very low interest rates in terms of the repayment of loans that they borrow to build houses and can come on stream.  We will accelerate the rapid building programme.  By the end of 2018, there will be at least 1,500 provided.  Look at these sites - much of the material comes in already manufactured elsewhere and grows exponentially in a very quick time.  HAP homeless tenancies are to deliver 550 in 2016 and 1,200 in 2017.  So far, they have delivered 450 this year.  Two hundred extra emergency beds for rough sleepers are to be put in place before the end of this year at a cost of &euro;4 million.  The Housing Agency will purchase 1,600 vacant properties and a number of these will be used to provide permanent homes for homeless people.  The agency has acquired 171 properties on behalf of the local authorities.  In addition, in excess of 730 homes have been offered to the agency for sale.  So far, bids have been made on 96 of these.  Of those, 49 have been accepted, and that work is going on.  The supply of social housing will increase to 47,000 houses by the end of 2021.  It is an ambitious target, but it is one that I believe will be achieved.  Under Rebuilding Ireland, housing first teams in Dublin will increase from 100 tenancies to 300 tenancies.  The point made here by those dealing with homeless people is that the housing first team capacity is very good.  Get the house first and then provide the wrap-around services for people who will live in those and occupy those things.  It seems to be very successful.  It is now being expanded here and we hope that it will be a big success.<\/p><p>I have mentioned the eighth amendment.<\/p><p>I would be very happy to recognise Senator Lawless.  I know the Senator for many years, but the reason - to be clear on this - for his appointment was because I had seen him in action in the United States, on Capitol Hill in particular, talking to Republican Senators and Congressmen and Democratic Senators and Congressmen.  Better known than many of those who serve on Capitol Hill in the White House is Senator Lawless.  His connection there on behalf of all of the Irish will be most fortunate for whoever is elected President in November and the new structure that will apply on Capitol Hill.  I wish the Senator well in his endeavours for the diaspora in general, but also in respect of undocumented Irish and elderly Irish who find themselves now stranded in condominiums far from their friends and their relations, unable to move out.  Our agencies and those who look after the needs of the Irish can be led by the Senator.  They are in very good hands in that regard.<\/p><p>I want to thank the father of House for his inspiring words.

We have been ready and committed to take 4,000 between relocation and resettlement.  It has been very slow starting off.  That has been streamlined now somewhat, particularly in Italy where there were problems.  Obviously, we have had problems in other locations as well.  I think he might be quite happy to come here and give the Seanad an update.  I know that he was answering questions in the D&aacute;il yesterday about this.  Much better progress is being made.  Actually, he has been around to visit quite a number of the locations where refugees or asylum seekers have been.

It is difficult to get agreement on these things - environmental, social, people impact and so on like that - but it is a location that is going to be the city of culture for 2020.

When it is triggered is the right of the Prime Minister.  Obviously, I have met the Secretary of State, Mr. Davis, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Brokenshire.  Most Ministers have met their counterparts and we are obviously looking at the contingency issues that are going to have to be dealt with here, but remember this - of all the countries to be affected by Brexit, Ireland is the most critical.  This does not affect other countries in south-eastern Europe to the same extent.  Given our connections with Britain over the years - social, economic, political and so on - and the working relationships that we have, we need to maintain those.  The common travel area affected both countries to their benefit before we joined the Union and since we joined the Union, but it has not been tested with one in and one out.  Clearly, we do not want to return to a hard Border here.  It is my intention not to have that.  It is also the intention of the British Prime Minister.  There may be different views in Europe.  If one has a land border between Dundalk and Derry, obviously we need to be able to look after our national interests, and our national interests were voted on in 1998 when the Good Friday Agreement was voted on and people North and South voted for the right and the opportunity to be able to travel on this island freely.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=580\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=580&amp;amp;pid=EndaKenny&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We do not want to see a situation whereby people in Northern Ireland who are entitled to Irish passports would be required to have visas to visit a part of this island that is a member state of the European Union when the UK has eventually pulled out of it.  There are issues that need to be examined.  I have spoken to a number of people about imaginative ways of ensuring that we can retain the best of what we have and move on.  From a European perspective, we need to face the future in a way that allows Europe to move forward with its almost 500 million people and all of the opportunities that presents.  Europe has evolved over the years out of the slaughter of two world wars.  Peace in Europe has been, possibly, taken for granted.  In the context of the human catastrophic events happening in Syria and Aleppo, that peace should never be taken for granted.  For this reason, it is important that the politics of Europe is focused on what we can do to deal with immigration and the prosperity and development of members countries.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell made an important point.  We are not going to play around with the public finances.  All of the people of the country have made sacrifices and we have moved to a point where we are in a better position than we were but we are not yet where we would like to be.  Careful management of and continued growth in the economy allows for expenditure to deal with those who have been left behind, those who have been neglected and those who have been treated unfairly.
