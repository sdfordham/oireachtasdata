However, a small minority is not and a range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has set out its strategic approach to tackling fraud and error in the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy.  It includes systematic measures to prevent and detect fraud and to ensure effective debt recovery and deterrence measures are in place. As part of these measures, the Department is continuing to improve and utilise more innovative approaches to prevent and detect fraud.<\/p>  <p>  A key measure of control activity is the value of control savings achieved by the Department on an annual basis.  Control savings are an estimate of the value of various control activities across schemes in payment.  They represent the value of prevented expenditure over a future period that would have been incurred if investigative and control work had not been carried out.  In this context the Department undertakes a substantial number of control reviews each year.  In 2014 over 1m control reviews were carried out yielding control savings of &euro;505m, 99% of the overall target set for 2014.  A similar level of savings is expected in 2015.  In addition work is ongoing utilising predictive analytics techniques to identify non-compliance amongst existing customers of the three main working age schemes.  These predictive models will enable the Department to detect more non-compliant cases and to do so more efficiently. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the presence on the ground has been increased through the secondment of 20 Garda&iacute; to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.  These officers are augmenting the resources and expertise available to the Department to detect and investigate fraud.<\/p>  <p>  Effective deterrence is also necessary to address fraud.  It is important to ensure appropriate sanctions can be applied where fraud is discovered.  Where an individual committing social welfare fraud thinks that the potential penalty or sanction is minimal, relative to the potential gain, then fraudulent activity will be encouraged and will most likely continue. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is proactively targeting persons with overpayments to ensure all persons who have a social welfare overpayment are making a contribution towards the repayment of the debt outstanding.  Enhanced debt recovery is being achieved through a new debt management system which went live in 2014.  &euro;83m in overpayments were recovered in 2014, &euro;8m more than the target set for the year and an increase of over 17% on the amount recovered in 2013 (&euro;71m approx.).  In addition over 315 cases were submitted for prosecution, which was in excess of the target set for last year.<\/p>  <p>  The overall aim of the Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling fraud and incorrect payments is to ensure that the available resources are targeted at, and are available for, the people, who need them most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100054#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100054#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[33792\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100054#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a disability payment will be approved for a person (details supplied) in County Carlow.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department is in receipt of an application for disability allowance (DA) from the above named person on 31 August 2015.

The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.

Over 13,700 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year showing that significant numbers are being accommodated under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.<\/p>  <p>  Analysis shows that increasing the current rent limits nationwide by 5% would result in a full year cost in excess of &euro;15 million, a 10% increase would carry a cost of almost &euro;37 million, with a 15% increase costing approximately &euro;51 million. A breakdown of this cost on a county basis is not available, however the costs to apply such an increase in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford regions, which accounts for over 58% of the customer base, would account for a significant proportion of this additional cost.  Though the costing model accurately reflects the increased cost for the scheme, the likelihood is that there will be little additional supply achieved for persons seeking rent supplement support due to the constrained market. There is also the additional risk in a market with such tight supply that rent supplement limits would generate homelessness for low income\/single earner families who could no longer compete with the higher rents. <\/p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants.  Under this measure tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 4,000 households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.

Relief for contributions is granted to an employee against the remuneration from the employment in respect of which the pension scheme is effected. The relief is given by way of deduction of the pension contributions as an expense in determining the employee's income tax liability for the year in question. In any tax year, the amount of contributions on which relief can be granted is limited to an age-related percentage (ranging from 15% to 40%) of the employee's remuneration (subject to an overall annual earnings' cap, which currently stands at &euro;115,000).<\/p><p>Employee contributions can take the form of ordinary annual contributions, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) or special contributions. AVCs allow employees to improve the retirement benefits provided by their occupational pension scheme at their own expense (i.e. without a corresponding employer contribution)provided the benefits stay within Revenue maximum limits. A common circumstance in which special contributions arise is in the context of payments to AVC schemes at or near the point of retirement (known as &quot;last minute&quot; AVCs) to enhance benefits (normally the lump sum). Irrespective of the type of contribution (ordinary, AVC or special) overall relief on contributions in any year cannot exceed the relevant age- related percentage limit of earnings. <\/p><p>In the case of ordinary annual contributions (and regular additional voluntary contributions) relief is normally provided by an employer under what is known as the net pay arrangementwhereby employee pension contributions are deducted from gross pay before tax is calculated. In the case of special contributions, relief is normally granted by way of a claim made by the taxpayer to Revenue at the end of the relevant tax year. Any unrelieved special contributions made in a year can be carried forward and treated as a contribution made in future years for the purposes of tax relief (subject to the relevant limits applying for those years). This spreading forward continues until the full amount had been granted relief or until it is no longer possible to carry the relief forward.<\/p><p>The inability to carry relief forward would occur, for example, where the employee has retiredin which case, as the relief for pension contributions is only available against the remuneration in respect of which the pension scheme is effected, the retirement results in a cessation of the roll forward of relief.<\/p><p>In that regard, however, section 774 (8) of the TCA 1997 provides for a limited spread-back provision for special contributions whereby a contribution made before the return filing date for a year (generally 31 October) can, where the taxpayer so elects, be treated as having been made in the previous year with tax relief granted in that earlier year (subject to the relevant age-related and earnings limits applying in that earlier year).<\/p><p>This is particularly useful where an individual is close to retirement, as he or she may have insufficient taxable income in the year in which the contributions are paid (i.e. the year of retirement) to absorb the full amount of the special contribution. In addition, the carry forward of unrelieved contributions to later years is not an option for such individuals, as pension income is not taken into account in computing income for pension contribution tax relief purposes. This facility, therefore, effectively allows the retiree to use the tax relief available to him or her in the year of retirement and, where necessary, to take advantage of any unused tax relief in the previous year. <\/p><p>In recognition of the fact that retiring employees who are not chargeable persons (within the meaning of Part 41A TCA 1997) may overlook the 31 October deadline for making an election, Revenue, in such cases, treats an election as being timely where it is received on or before the 31 December of the year of retirement, once the special contribution has been made by the earlier of the return filing date (i.e. 31 October) and the date of retirement.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#0000FF\">[1]<\/font><\/i>The legislation only refers to ordinary annual contributions and contributions that are not ordinary annual contributions but the latter encompass AVCs and special contributions. AVCs can be made on a regular basis (like ordinary annual contributions) or on a once off or occasional basis in which case they are generally referred to as special contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[33825\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of equalising the treatment of pay as you earn, PAYE, and non-PAYE workers earning over &euro;100,000 per year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[33826\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of reducing the 11% rate of universal social charge for non-pay as you earn workers earning over &euro;100,000 per year to 10% and to 9%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[33827\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of introducing an earned income tax credit for self-employed people of &euro;250; &euro;500; &euro;825; &euro;1,650, per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[33828\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of increasing the personal income tax credit by &euro;100 and by &euro;200 per year; the number of taxpayers who would benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[33829\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of reducing the 7% rate of universal social charge to 5.5% and to 5%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[33830\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100056#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who paid the 3% universal social charge surcharge on earnings over &euro;100,000 in each year since 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 to 68, inclusive together.<\/p><p>Regarding the question as to the cost of equalising the treatment of Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and non-PAYE income earners over &euro;100,000, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the current 3% Universal Social Charge (USC) surcharge applicable to self-assessed income over &euro;100,000.

For the purposes of this estimate, it is assumed that the\u00a0credit would only be extended to cases identified to be in receipt of Trading or Professional (Case I or Case II) income, and not currently in receipt of the PAYE credit. The estimate does not take into account the ability of the credit to be fully absorbed.<\/p><p>Regarding the question of the cost of increasing the personal income tax credit by &euro;100; and by &euro;200, per annum; and the number of tax payers who would benefit, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer would be of the order of &euro;219 million and &euro;436 million respectively. The number of income earners to benefit from the Deputy's proposal would be 1.4 million. The increase in the personal tax credits mentioned in the Deputy's Question is assumed to apply in similar measure to widowed persons tax credit and to include the normal consequential increases in the tax credit for lone parents and the married tax credit.

It should be noted that in 2014, the most recent year available, it is estimated that over 70 individuals claimed relief under the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII)\u00a0for investments at or near the limit of &euro;150,000. This does not take into account individuals who invest via a fund.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that it is not possible to state the cost of permanently removing the EII from the High Earners restriction as the effect of including the scheme in the restriction is to delay the relief rather than disallow it. This means the effect of removing it from the restriction would only lead to a temporary cash flow gain which could be in the region of &euro;1 million each year from 2018. There would be no cash flow for earlier years as the scheme is not included in the restriction for investments before 1 January 2017.<\/p><p>The estimated cash flow cost of providing full Income Tax relief in the year of investment, rather than over two stages, as currently provided, would be in the region of &euro;7 million to &euro;10 million in the first year of introduction. The incentive\u00a0does not provide relief from Universal Social Charge and Pay Related Social Insurance, so this has not been costed.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of statistical information is available on the Commissioners' Statistics web page: .  In particular, the tax expenditure section of the web page includes the cost of the scheme: .<\/p><p>Data in relation to the number of jobs supported will become available at a later stage. Under the terms of the scheme, relief in respect of 30% of the amount invested in a qualifying company is granted to the investor in the year of investment, while the balance is only due where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company at the end of the 3 year holding period\u00a0or where evidence is provided that the company used the capital raised for expenditure on research and development. Claims for the balance of the relief will be due from 2015.<\/p><p>In relation to increasing the investment period to five years, it is not possible to accurately estimate the impact of the tax cost but presumably there would be a disincentive effect on investment in the scheme which would likely lower the tax cost.<\/p><p>The cost of increasing the &euro;10 million company investment lifetime limit to &euro;15 million, &euro;20 million and &euro;25 million would depend on the ability of companies to secure investment in excess of the existing scheme.

The Revenue Commissioners do not require rental income data to be returned in a manner which would enable commercial and private rental accommodation income to be separately identified. \u00a0Similarly, income from the categories of tenant in the Deputy's proposals and the current level of mortgage interest deduction specific to such lettings is not separately identified.<\/p><p>In this context, it should be noted that an increase in interest deductibility would only be of benefit to those landlords that have borrowings outstanding in respect of the purchase or improvement of the relevant property. This limits the potential of any measure to incentivise landlords to commit to rent certainty. In addition, rent certainty would not of itself solve the supply-side issues that are driving rent increases. I note that the ESRI in their Quarterly Economic Commentary, published yesterday, urge that in light of difficult past experience, extreme caution should be taken when any use of the tax system as a means of stimulating activity in the residential property market is being considered.<\/p><p>Significant administrative issues would also need to be addressed in the implementation of such a measure.  It should also be noted that any increase in the deduction allowed for interest could not be confined to areas experiencing specific accommodation shortfalls, such as the major urban centres, and this would significantly increase the deadweight cost of the measure.\u00a0 Furthermore it is likely that the increased deductibility would have to be applied in respect of taxable rental income sourced throughout the EU\/EEA, where\u00a0similar conditions are met.<\/p><p>With regard to the calculation of rental profits under current legislation, I would point out that there are also a number of other allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid.

This resulted in a successful exit from the programme in December 2013.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the fiscal policies of this Government and the efforts of the Irish people,\u00a0Budget 2015 marked a turning point\u00a0where expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets and the Government could look to making targeted increases in expenditure for key sectors. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Spring Economic Statement (SES),\u00a0Ireland is on track to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) at the end of 2015 with a General Government Deficit of 2.3%. With Ireland moving to the preventive arm of the SGP, the SES outlined that fiscal space of the order of &euro;1.2 to &euro;1.5 billion would be available for Budget 2016\u00a0split evenly between expenditure increases and tax reductions. This will allow the Government to target prudent increases in expenditure of up to\u00a0&euro;750 million in 2016 relative to the 2015 spend. \u00a0The specific measures will be announced on Budget day.<\/p>  <p>  Public service reform remains at the heart of this Government's agenda and focuses on ensuring efficiency and improving outcomes for service users - that is, every citizen in the country. Investment in public services will continue to be targeted at priority areas and will be linked closely with reform. Importantly, the cost savings delivered through the reform programme are available for priority front-line services. Furthermore, the wide-ranging reforms to the budgetary architecture introduced by this Government support the efficient use of public funds to deliver effective services for citizens. The implementation of a medium term budgetary framework and the introduction of wide-scale reviews of public expenditure with the Comprehensive Reviews of Expenditure allow for greater consideration and debate about key challenges facing public expenditure. In this regard,\u00a0the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) is an integrated cross-Government service which enhances the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy making.\u00a0 IGEES staff operate in designated economic evaluation units and are engaged with almost all Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  Specific measures for Housing and Health are contained in\u00a0the recently published Capital Investment Framework.

This new minimum age requirement is based on the veterinary and scientific advice that an animal less than 3 months old may be too young to effectively vaccinate against rabies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100060#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100060#WRJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[33813\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100060#WRJ02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment under the 2015 areas of natural constraint scheme and the 2015 basic payment scheme will issue to a farmer (details supplied) in County Mayo; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>An application under the 2015 Basic Payments\/Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme was received from the person named on 29 May 2015.

The Government has given a firm commitment to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and intends to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has a dualist legal system and therefore does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary. We are determined to take the steps necessary to meet all the Convention's requirements in a constructive, proactive and appropriate manner. I should stress that for Ireland, ratification is the end of the preparation and implementation phase, not the beginning.<\/p>  <p>  A team within my Department has been charged with examining all outstanding obstacles to ratification, and has nearly completed the first phase of its work, which includes identifying all areas which will need attention to make ratification possible. My Department chairs the Interdepartmental Committee, which comprises representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Children and Youth Affairs; Finance; Education and Skills; Health; Defence; Environment, Community and Local Government; Public Expenditure and Reform; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; Social Protection; and the Office of Public Works.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress towards ratification continues to be made and much has been accomplished.  The requirement to enact suitable capacity legislation has long been one of the core obstacles to ratification of the Convention and the progress made in this area is a testament to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the obligations of the CRPD in a comprehensive and meaningful way. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 passed D&aacute;il Committee Stage on 17 June 2015 and enactment is expected by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Progress is also being made on necessary reforms to legislation on sexual offences, and by my colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State for Primary and Social Care, on reforms to mental health legislation.  Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Further measures required to enable ratification include amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation. <\/p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Committee has agreed on the main areas across Departments where legislative amendment or new legislation will be necessary to meet the requirements of the Convention. These proposals will be contained in a Roadmap to Ratification, which will be submitted to Government shortly.  Once approved by Government, we will publish the Roadmap outlining the measures to be taken to overcome all outstanding barriers to ratification of UN CRPD, along with the estimated timescales involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100061#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1018"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100061#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[33686\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100061#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the criteria under which persons are granted enhanced remission; the number of persons who have applied for enhanced remission in 2015; the number granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[33687\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100061#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons who have applied for enhanced remission in each of the years 2007 to 2014; the number granted in these years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware the principles governing the awarding of enhanced remission are contained under Rule 59 of the Prison Rules 2007 to 2014 (S.I.

The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated in detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. The JOCH report was published in June 2015.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  The Bill is due to be published in the autumn. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol. The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices. MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.<\/p>  <p>  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences. On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100064#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100064#WRN00350"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[33649\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100064#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is liaising with the Health Service Executive, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to address the urgently needed provision of 500,000 additional personal assistant hours for citizens with disabilities in budget 2016, given that the projected &euro;45 million cost over three years would be greatly offset by freeing up bed space in hospitals and care institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":408,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[33778\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100064#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to support the funding of personal assistant services for people with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":409,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 182 together.<\/p>  <p>  Work is currently underway in the Department of Health in relation to the preparation of budget estimates for 2016.

The Bill is due to be published in the autumn. <\/p>  <p>  The opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice on minimum unit pricing (MUP) for alcohol products was published on the 3 September 2015.  The opinion indicates that minimum unit pricing may be compatible with European Law if it can be shown to be more effective than other alternative measures.  The Department of Health will study the opinion and its implications before the final judgement of the Court.  This is expected towards the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100065#WRO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100065#WRO02200"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[33741\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100065#WRO02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made in reducing waiting times for patients awaiting inpatient and day care treatment; for outpatient appointments at Mayo General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>Improving waiting times for scheduled care for patients is a key priority for the Government.

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.<\/p><p>Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educational Needs &ndash; A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007\/8. In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process.<\/p><p>The continua described above all involve a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools processes which moves from basic classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions and comprise three distinct school based phases characterised as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Classroom Support &ndash; is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,<br \/><br \/>School Support - is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support\/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher.

This map is available at .  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER and was developed based on the most up to date information available at the time of publication.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by end 2016. <\/p><p>The areas marked AMBER represent those areas where the State intends to intervene to ensure those areas will have access to high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>This exercise identified 33,336 premises that will be covered by commercial operators (27,640 residential and 5,696 business) by the end of 2016. 50,831 premises currently fall within the NBP intervention area (39,218 residential and 11,613 business).<\/p><p>My Department is in the process of updating the Map, taking into consideration any new information received or operator announcements made of any new plans in 2016 and beyond.  We expect to publish an updated version of the Map before the end of this year.<\/p><p>The NBP proposed Intervention Strategy document, which was published on 15 July last, sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention.  It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered.  It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned. <\/p><p>It is intended that the network will be built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.  This will allow us to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland will have access to high speed services, by 2020 at the latest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100072#WRV02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100072#WRV03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100072#WRV02900"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[33664\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100100072#WRV03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to meet the chief executive officer of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>\u200bI have periodic meetings with the Chief Executive Officer of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.
