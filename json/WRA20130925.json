Files in respect of three members of the Force were forwarded to the Assistant Commissioner in Internal Affairs for further investigation under the Disciplinary Regulations (the question of discipline for members is, in the first instance, a matter for the Commissioner in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations of 2007).  <\/p><p>  The O'Mahoney report, and the related report by the Garda Professional Standards Unit, recommended a number of changes aimed at ensuring that administrative procedures are correctly followed throughout the Force in relation to the cancellation of fixed charge notices.  In publishing the reports, I welcomed their recommendations for enhanced safeguards to ensure integrity in the Fixed Charge Processing System.\u00a0 In addition, in order to provide even further public reassurance as to the effectiveness of these changes, and with the agreement of the Garda Commissioner, I asked the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to validate the proposed changes prior to implementation, including making any necessary supplementary recommendations, and to review their implementation after 18 months.\u00a0\u00a0The Inspectorate is making progress in its work in this regard and I await their report.  <\/p><p>  I also provided the two reports to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for their consideration and for advice on any further recommendations or procedural or legislative changes which are desirable in this area.  I have also consulted with my colleague the Minster for Transport in this matter.  I am absolutely committed to the introduction of whatever improvements are necessary to ensure continuing public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the implementation of road traffic laws by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>  In addition to the action I have taken above, the Garda Commissioner as a result of both reports established an implementation group to revise the Garda Policy document on the Fixed Charge Processing System and to incorporate the recommendations of both the examination and the reports in consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that a circular with revised cancellation procedures in relation to Fixed Charge Notices issued to all members of the Garda Siochana on 30 August.

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.  However, to be of assistance I have contacted the Legal Aid Board for the information requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011). <\/p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.    I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.<\/p><p>  I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500062#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Investigations","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500062#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[39809\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500062#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will carry out an inquiry into the reports that Shell gave boxes of alcohol as presents to the Garda station in Rossport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable. <\/p><p>  However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders' register would be likely to be counter-productive.

The 2005 Act also provides for protocols on the sharing of information between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Ombudsman Commission. Protocols were agreed in 2007 and set down time limits for the provision of information by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Garda Ombudsman Commission.<\/p><p>  The Garda Ombudsman Commission, however, raised concerns in their 2012 Annual Report regarding delays in concluding their investigations, and in particular delays in receiving requested information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Scheme is being phased out on this gradual basis in order to give affected organisations as much time as possible to adjust to the change and to consider alternative methods of charitable fundraising.  The planned timeframe for winding down the Scheme is as follows. In 2012, the total amount of assistance disbursed under the Scheme was &euro;6 million. In 2013 this will reduce to &euro;4 million, in 2014 to &euro;2 million, and in 2015 - the final year of the Scheme - to &euro;1 million.<\/p><p>  All payments under the Scheme are of course subject in the usual way to availability of funding on an annual basis, receipt of satisfactory applications from eligible organisations, and compliance by beneficiaries with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  Provision for an increase in the prize fund limits applicable to private charitable lotteries is included in the National Lottery Act 2013 which is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is the intention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to commence this provision shortly. This will update the total prize fund limit for lotteries held under section 27 of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act from &pound;3,000, where it has stood since 1987, to &euro;5,000. For lotteries held under section 28 of the 1956 Act, the limit will increase from &euro;20,000 (set in 2002) to &euro;30,000.<\/p><p>  Separately, in July 2013, the Government approved the General Scheme of a Gambling Control Bill, which will update our laws on gambling, and will involve the repeal of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  This legislation will cover lotteries, but will exclude the National Lottery.  The General Scheme, which is available on my Department's website, sets out the proposed increases in prize fund limits for lotteries that fall within the remit of this proposed legislation.  The General Scheme has been referred to the Attorney General's Office for formal legal drafting.

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. <\/p><p>  A suspended sentence imposed by the District Court is appealable to the Circuit Court. In such instances the District Court would normally, or on request, fix recognisances in the event of an Appeal. Once the appellant has lodged an original of the Notice of Appeal, together with a statutory declaration as to service and entered into a recognisance as fixed by the Court the suspended sentence is stayed pending determination of the Appeal by the Circuit Court. Where an appeal is to the Court of Criminal Appeal there are established procedures in place for applications for priority to be made to the judge having management of the List and the basis for any such application could include an assertion that the term of the suspended sentence is likely to have expired before the hearing. The Courts Service has indicated that an appeal by a convicted person against a suspended sentence is rare except perhaps where the terms of the suspension are deemed to be too onerous.  An appeal against conviction might be brought in a case where a suspended sentence was imposed but where the suspended sentence is of itself not the subject of an appeal. In addition, the imposition of a suspended sentence can be the basis of an undue leniency application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). There are  currently 154 cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal list awaiting hearing; sixteen of these are undue leniency applications by the DPP and four of those applications concern sentences where sentence was suspended.<\/p><p>  The President of the Circuit Court is determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and has been working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times. It should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of Circuit Court sittings in venues outside Dublin. This has increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters as well as dealing with District Court Appeals. With the increase in capacity assigned to date in 2013, significant progress has been achieved in reducing waiting times across the Circuit Court.<\/p><p>  The Service has indicated that waiting times in the Court of Criminal Appeal vary depending on the category of the case. As already mentioned,  priority applications may be made to the court and the judge will decide such applications on a range of competing priorities. I am informed that the Chief Justice, in consultation with the President of the High Court, has convened 9 additional sittings during September and the first week of October to deal with sentence appeals and undue leniency applications. A total of 55 such cases have been allocated hearing dates comprising 36 sentence appeals and 19 undue leniency applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500065#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Provision","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500065#WRE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[39750\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500065#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are further closures of rural court houses expected in the coming year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is in this context that the Service keeps the number of court venues it maintains under continuous review with no court venue being singled out or exempt from the review process.

Where there is a single national police force, the case for the setting up of a policing authority to act as a link between democratic institutions and the day to day responsibility for operational policing loses much of its force.  This additional layer would dilute democratic accountability and political responsibility.  The relationship between the Garda Commissioner, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas has developed over time.  The accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the House, both directly and through the Minister for Justice and Equality, has been strengthened by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p><p>  The separate roles of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner in relation to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided for under the provisions of the 2005 Act.

In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, as well as the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.

To pass control of such matters to an unelected body beyond the executive and the legislature would clearly be problematical.

A number of task forces are already in existence which serve to target cross border organised criminal activity including the Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling and the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group.<\/p><p>  Through the work of these task forces, successful actions continue to be taken against those involved in such forms of crime with criminal groups, operating in both jurisdictions, having been identified and disrupted, with them being specifically targeted for investigation by all the enforcement agencies concerned.<\/p><p>  Further to this a Cross Border Threat Assessment is updated for law enforcement purposes and is published biennially in conjunction with the Cross Border Seminar on Organised Crime. The Assessment is important in aiding law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border to identify emerging trends in cross border criminality, and serves to highlight issues of immediate concern. <\/p><p>  Specifically with regard to tackling any terrorist threat, the counter-terrorism strategies and intelligence-led operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in cooperation with its partners in Northern Ireland, are focused on targeting and disrupting any operational planning or logistical support being conducted or contemplated in this jurisdiction. <\/p><p>  In tandem with this ongoing co-operation taking place at operational level, I meet and maintain regular contact with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to address matters of mutual concern and enhance effective co-operation and co-ordination on all criminal justice matters.  <\/p><p>  Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters we operate a structured framework to further develop this co-operation.

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presidents monitor waiting times across all courts lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. <\/p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum. <\/p><p>  I am informed that waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases.  The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times. In relation to the Circuit Court, it should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of sittings in venues outside Dublin. This increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  In addition, six specialist judges of the Circuit Court were appointed in July to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. The President of the District Court is also concentrating judicial resources in the areas of greatest need. <\/p><p>  In relation to the High Court, the Courts Service has indicated that there are 4,422 cases listed and awaiting trial in the various lists. High Court waiting times are generally in the range of 2 to 5 months except in relation to Asylum cases where the delay is currently 2 years. The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives including the reorganisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses.  In addition the delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has also increased judicial availability for trial work.  These initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded.  As indicated above, with the exception of the Asylum List, waiting times in the High Court have been maintained at low levels.  I am informed that delays in the Asylum list are due to several factors including the high volume of cases. Delays in lists also occur where parties who have certified the case as ready to proceed and\/or applied for a hearing date inform the court that they are not ready to proceed on the allocated date and apply for adjournment.<\/p><p>  The Service has indicated that the waiting time in the Central Criminal Court is in the region of 12 months. I am also advised that waiting times in the Court of Criminal Appeal vary depending on the category of the case and there are 154 cases awaiting a hearing at present.  I understand that the Chief Justice, in consultation with the President of the High Court, has convened 9 additional sittings during September and the first week of October to deal with sentence appeals\/undue leniency applications. A total of 55 such cases have been allocated hearing dates comprising 36 sentence appeals and 19 undue leniency applications.<\/p><p>  The Supreme Court, however, continues to experience lengthy waiting times which are now almost four and a half years.  Waiting times for priority cases are in the region of 10 months at present. I am informed that there are 666 appeals which the parties have certified as ready to proceed in the Supreme Court List and awaiting hearing.  Although considerable efforts are being made to manage the waiting times, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Appeal. The referendum on the proposed Thirty-third Amendment of the Constitution (Court of Appeal) Bill will be held on October 4th 2013. In addition, it is expected that the appointment of two additional Supreme Court judges in the autumn will allow the Supreme Court to sit regularly in two Divisions which should have a positive impact reasonably quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500067#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500067#WRG01050"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[39757\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500067#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda ethnic liason officers that are currently working with minority communities.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no direct function in the matter. <\/p><p>  However, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are currently three hundred and twenty Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) appointed to work with minority communities at local level.

It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.

Despite Ireland's reputation as one of the world's most globalised economies, 64% of private sector workers are employed by indigenous non-exporting firms, with 56% working for indigenous, non-exporting small businesses.  These numbers highlight the importance of domestic demand for sustaining and generating employment in Ireland, and suggest that our recovery strategy needs to give some additional support to small businesses.<\/p><p>  To that end, the 10 Point Tax Reform Plan contains measures to assist small business in a number of ways by:<blockquote>Helping their cash flow position; <br \/><br \/>Helping them access funding;<br \/><br \/>Reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance;<br \/><br \/>Boosting demand for their products in new markets; and incentivising them to create jobs.<\/blockquote>  The measures are as follows:<blockquote>1. Reforming the 3 Year Corporation Tax Relief for Start Up Companies to allow unused credits to be carried forward to help create jobs and improve cash flow<br \/><br \/>2. Amending the Close Company Surcharge by increasing the <i>de minimis<\/i> level to &euro;2,000 to reduce the administrative burden and assist cash flow<br \/><br \/>3. Increasing the amount of expenditure eligible for the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit on a full volume basis (without reference to the 2003 base year) to &euro;200,000 to encourage innovation and help cash flow<br \/><br \/>4. Increasing the VAT cash receipts basis accounting threshold from &euro;1m to &euro;1.25m to help cash flow<br \/><br \/>5. Extending the Foreign Earnings Deduction for work related travel to Algeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal &amp;amp; Tanzania to help boost demand for Irish goods and services abroad<br \/><br \/>6. Extending the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme to 2020 to help companies access funding<br \/><br \/>7. Extending the general rate and Young Trained Farmers rate of stock relief and amendments to the definition of registered partnerships for stock relief to give a targeted assistance to the farming sector<br \/><br \/>8. Introducing a Capital Gains Tax relief for Farmers for land restructuring to give a target assistance to the farming sector<br \/><br \/>9.

Announcing a joint Revenue and Department of Finance public consultation: 'Taxation of Micro Enterprises: Reduction in Compliance Costs' to identify ways to ease the administrative burden<\/blockquote>  Measures 1 to 9 were implemented in Finance Act 2013 which was enacted in March 2013. Revenue data on take-up of the various measures will not be available until the 2013 income and corporation tax returns of relevant businesses are filed with Revenue.  The exact filing date will depend on individual circumstances but in the main will arise in Q4 2014.<\/p><p>  To elaborate on some of the specific items in the plan, I would note that in relation to Measure 4, the annual turnover threshold for eligibility for the cash basis of accounting for VAT was increased from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.25 million in Budget 2013 with effect from 1 May 2013. While there are no direct statistics available, it is expected that over 800 businesses will have benefitted from this Budget change.<\/p><p>  In relation to Measure 5, the Foreign Earnings Deduction was extended in Finance Act 2013 to include the countries listed above.  This relief is available to all qualifying persons travelling to these countries for work-related travel for the tax years 2013 and 2014.  In relation to Measure 6, the EII is a state aid scheme and accordingly, the approval of the European Commission is required. An application was made to the European Commission in June to extend the EII until 2020. Officials continue to engage with the Commission in relation to the application and the extension will be implemented as soon as possible, once approval has been received.<\/p><p>  In respect of Measure 7, extending the general rate and Young Trained Farmers rate of stock relief and amendments to the definition of registered partnerships for stock relief to give a targeted assistance to the farming sector, provision was made in Finance Act 2013 and a Statutory Instrument will need to be signed once agreement has been indicated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>  As regards Measure 8, Section 48 of Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from capital gains tax on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring, subject to a Commencement Order, which I made on 6 June 2013 (due to the need to obtain EU State Aid approval for the measure).  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes. The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase. <\/p><p>  Measure 9 relates to reviewing the 'carried interest' provision in the tax code to help small businesses to access funding. Following a review of the carried interest provisions in the tax code, Finance Act 2013 made a number of changes with the aim of making the provisions operate as intended. Firstly, it extends the scope of the relief so that it is not limited to carried interest derived from investment in trading companies at the start-up phase only. Secondly, it links the relief to the overall performance of the investment portfolio of the qualifying venture capital fund. Thirdly, it reduces the duration of the period for which the investment in the target companies must be held from 6 years to 3 years. Lastly, it extends the relief that is currently available to companies and partnerships to individual venture fund managers. These amendments are designed to assist companies engaging in innovation activities to access investment from venture capital funds.<\/p><p>  As yet, no information is available on the number of people who have availed of CGT farm restructuring relief and\/or availed of the revised carried interest provisions because they will be applied for via personal income tax returns for 2013 which will not be submitted until late in 2014. It is not anticipated that these returns will include a provision for the separate capture of specific information in relation to these incentives.<\/p><p>Finally, in respect of Measure 10, 'Taxation of Micro Enterprises: Reduction in Compliance Costs', the public consultation closed in February 2013, and only a small number of submissions were received (7 in total).  The results of the consultation are being considered by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners at present, with a view to identifying next steps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500070#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Investment Incentive Scheme","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500070#WRK00575"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[39907\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500070#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when proposals were submitted to the EU Commission for approval of section 22 of the Finance Act 2013; the reason for the delay in obtaining approval; when it is envisaged that approval will be obtained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.   The Irish Credit Bureau is a private entity and I have no direct function in the day-to-day operational decisions. In relation to the credit ratings provided to SME&rsquo;s my department has recognised the need to reorganise the government reporting system and we have established an inter-agency working group at the end of 2010 to develop a strategy to put in place an effective credit reporting system in Ireland.<\/p><p>  However, the Deputy will be aware that the Credit Reporting Bill, 2012 is currently passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas which provides for the creation of an effective statutory based credit reporting system.  The Bill includes the following provisions: The database will be owned by the Central Bank and the Bank will be responsible for the operation of the Central Credit Register; There will be mandatory reporting of a comprehensive range of credit information by credit providers; The Bill provides for controls with regard to access to information on the Register. By including provisions relating to access to data and security measures as well as provisions to help to deal with identity theft, this legislation should inspire confidence in businesses and in the consumer.  The legislation proposes to extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from micro enterprises and SMEs (with a turnover of less than &euro;3m) in respect of their data held on the Credit Register. This initiative may provide some comfort to enterprises where they have a concern in relation to the potential storing of inaccurate data and where they do not have the resources to take legal action through the Courts to seek to have the data corrected. Inaccurate data on the Central Credit Register could result in the refusal of credit to a small company.  In line with International practice, it provides for a retention period of 5 years in relation to credit information with respect to debts from the day on which it is entered on the Register. The Bill provides for the retention of information for a period of 6 months in relation to credit applications from the day it is entered on the Register. Anonymised information may be retained indefinitely.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Government is fully engaged in supporting the SME sector and has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved the targets for 2011 and 2012.  I have met the Boards of each of the banks in which the State has a shareholding three times since the start of this year. At these meetings, I have emphasised the importance of access to credit for SMEs and the need for an adequate flow of finance to be available to viable small businesses in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks&rsquo; capacity, processes and systems.  <\/p><p>  I should stress that the Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by the pillar banks as well as when credit is refused by them. I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500071#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500071#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[40071\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500071#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the financial penalties that will be applied to persons who do not register to pay the local property tax on time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>Section 146 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a monetary penalty where a liable person fails to deliver a Return to the Revenue Commissioners.

Under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.<\/p><p>  Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. A framework document was published jointly by the Post Primary Management bodies and the NAPD (National Association of Principals &amp;amp; Deputies) in September, 2012 to provide guidance for school management in the allocation of teaching hours to guidance counselling in post-primary schools in the context of the decision in Budget 2012 to withdraw the provision of ex-quota guidance hours to schools.

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated. The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.<\/p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012. This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme. At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%. Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. <\/p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country. I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them. If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents. Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books. A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them. I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes. All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year. <\/p><p>I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. <\/p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012. This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes. None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.<\/p><p>  Many schools have adopted the use of ebooks and this is a decision for the schools themselves.  In deciding whether to adopt ebooks there are many factors to be taken into account.  The most important factor is to consider whether e-books will support the achievement of relevant learning outcomes and enhance the learning experience.  E books have the potential to provide learners and teachers with many different ways of exploring the curriculum.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education (former NCTE) addresses the use of tablets and ebooks in its training courses and is available to advise schools on these issues and a comprehensive advice sheet will shortly be available on the PDST TIE website.  Work is currently underway on a new ICT Strategy for schools and matters relating to the use of ebooks and use of digital content will be one of the key issues explored in that strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Voluntary Contributions","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRN00350"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[40027\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department issues guidelines on the imposition of voluntary contribution charges; and if it will be possible to encourage or mandate to provide a minimum time notice such as nine months in advance of changes to such contributions.","asker":"1110","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>Apart from the recognised fee-charging second level schools, recognised schools are not permitted to charge school fees. <\/p><p>All other recognised schools are precluded from charging school fees.

The resulting report produced from this casework may, or may not, be used by school authorities to underpin an application to the NCSE for additional teaching supports and\/or resources for the child or student in question (indeed a range of reports from medical practitioners and other clinicians may be used in this connection). This usage of the assessment report is not recorded by NEPS centrally - the main focus being the putting in place of appropriate interventions to ameliorate the particular difficulties faced by the child.<\/p><p>  By way of further explanation of the process used by NEPS I can inform the Deputy that in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. <\/p><p>  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educational Needs - A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007\/8. In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process. <\/p><p>  The continua described above all involve a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools processes which moves from basic classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions and comprise three distinct school based phases characterised as follows:<\/p><p>  Classroom Support - is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,<\/p><p>  School Support - is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support\/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher. Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.<\/p><p>  School Support Plus - is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service (predominantly NEPS) in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes. This level of intervention is for children with complex and\/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels. <\/p><p>  The staged model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration and intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need. The continuum approach ensures that pupils presenting within this range are dealt with quickly and at the appropriate level.<\/p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that NEPS psychologists undertook individual case work with some 8,402 children or students and NEPS funded a further 2,068 assessments under the SCPA Scheme in 2011\/12. In 2012\/13 7,898 cases are currently recorded as undertaken by NEPS psychologists (this however is not the final figure and subject to update) and 2,167 assessment were funded in schools under the SCPA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2014 Issues","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRN00750"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[40101\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will protect primary education in Budget 2014 particularly on the class size issue.","asker":"1017","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The budget for education, including the number of teaching posts that we can afford to fund in schools is a matter that I will have to consider with my colleagues in Cabinet in the context of the forthcoming budget.

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.<\/p><p>  Under the school meals local projects scheme, funding is provided towards breakfast\/snack, lunch and\/or dinner clubs.  It is the responsibility of the school\/organisation as to which club they choose to operate.  In the academic year 2012\/13 there were approximately 550 breakfast\/snack clubs funded under the school meals local projects scheme out of a total of over 2,000 food clubs.  The Department is currently in the process of finalising applications from some additional 80 schools to the scheme for the new school year. <\/p><p>  Priority for funding under the school meals locals projects scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  Following the provision of the additional &euro;2 million funding this year, the Department wrote to approximately 170 DEIS schools encouraging expressions of interest in participating in the school meals scheme for the current school year.  The Department also contacted a further 11 schools\/groups who had previously made an application to join the scheme inviting them to participate in the scheme for the final term of the 2012\/2013 school year &ndash; which one group, a School Completion Programme in Co. Wicklow accepted and joined the scheme during May 2013.<\/p><p>  In addition to the schools meals programme, the Department, through its child and social inclusion policy division, provided funding of &euro;22,500 in the form of a social inclusion grant to Healthy Food for All (HFfA) in 2013.  The purpose of this funding is to support programme activities aimed at improving access to a healthy and affordable diet.  The HFfA's breakfast club initiative is one of a number of programme activities co-ordinated nationally by HFfA to address food poverty in local schools and communities.  This food poverty initiative adds value to the Government&rsquo;s investment in the school meals programme. <\/p><p>  I am fully supportive of these programmes that aim to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, by reason of lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Administration","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRO00925"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[39859\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will extend the closing date for accepting applications for JobBridge in the education sector following her announcement of extending the duration of internships; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[39908\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the policy rationale underpinning the decision to expand JobBridge internships to 18 months.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[39909\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide a list of all employers that have availed of JobBridge to date; the number of interns each has taken on; the duration of each of these internships.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 107 and 108 together.<\/p><p>  On 18<sup>th<\/sup> September, I announced that the maximum cumulative duration of internships would be extended to 18 months.  The maximum duration of individual internships will remain 9 months.  Individuals will be able to avail of up to 3 internships.  Individuals will be permitted to undertake a maximum of one internship with a particular Host Organisation.  These changes reflect both the recommendations contained in the independent evaluation of JobBridge published by the Taoiseach and myself on 1<sup>st<\/sup> May, 2013, and a significant demand from interns and other individuals made directly to me.  This change will be of significant benefit to jobseekers as it will provide jobseekers who may be dissatisfied with their jobBridge placement more flexibility in finding a suitable alternative placement. <\/p><p>  However, those changes have not yet come into force.  When they do come into force it will be announced on the Home Page of the JobBridge website .  In relation to Education Sector internships, Host organisations can apply for internships in the Education sector, for the current academic year, up to 6<sup>th<\/sup> December 2013.

I do not consider it possible to introduce amending primary legislation to provide for an extension to the deadline or to provide for an exemption for particular categories of vehicles at this late stage, and indeed, it would be difficult to make the necessary technical adjustments to the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) within the short timescale involved.  Further, exempting or extending the deadline for one particular category would inevitably lead to similar calls from other groups of road user. <\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of lost registration books , motor tax offices have been advised that, in order to facilitate the processing of declarations of non-use, applications should not be rejected on the basis that there is no registration document number on the application form, providing the application is otherwise in order and the vehicle and owner details correspond with the record of the vehicle on the NVDF.   <\/p><p>  For owners of vehicles recorded on the NVDF who are unable to locate the registration document for the vehicle, an application for a replacement document may be made at any time using Form RF134, which is available from motor tax offices or for download from .  It will not be necessary to do so before 30 September.   <\/p><p>  However, a registration book will be required, along with a Notification of Transfer of Vehicle Ownership, prior to the making of a declaration of non-use of a vehicle, in instances where the owner wishing to make the declaration of non-use is not the registered owner of the vehicle. <\/p><p>  A registration book may also be requested by the Motor Tax Office in instances where there is no record of the vehicle on the National and Vehicle Driver File (NVDF). The absence of a registration book will not necessarily preclude the updating of the record on the National Vehicle File as a manual pre-NVDF record may be in existence and the vehicle record can be updated on the basis of that information.  In such instances, liability for motor tax or the requirement to make a declaration of non-use of a vehicle will only arise from the date of updating of the vehicle record.   <\/p><p>  Vehicle owners should contact their local motor tax office for guidance in relation to their own particular circumstance s .   <\/p><p>Finally, in relation to vehicles that are no longer in use, it should be noted that the facility to make a declaration of non-use, where a vehicle is temporarily not in use in a public place, is to avoid arrears of motor tax when the vehicle is being put back on the road.  If the owner of the vehicle will not be put ting it on the road in the future , he or she need take no action in respect of the new procedures being put in place as no tax liability arises.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Social Housing Provision","counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRV00088"},{"type":"question","counter":389,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[40122\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRV00100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if there is a deadline in place for the National Assets Management Agency to transfer a number of its properties to social housing initiatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":390,"content":"<p>NAMA continues to work closely with my Department, the Housing Agency and with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in relation to the delivery of social housing.

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.  <\/p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jury System","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRY01500"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[40083\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of incidences of witness, juror or court-officer intimidation identified in each of the past five years to date; the extent if any to which prosecutions were negative affected or failed as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":463,"content":"<p>The  intimidation of a witness or juror is an offence pursuant to Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, which specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.<\/p><p>Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the offence is now punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years.

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.<\/p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy I will refer him to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 1098 set down for written answer on 18 September 2013 which is detailed below.<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I wish to inform the Deputy that there is no waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid as under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid on the applicant's appearance in Court.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In relation to civil legal aid, it should be noted that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. (I have included below a table showing the waiting times for non prioritised matters at the Board&rsquo;s law centres. It will be noted that most of the centres are operating the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach. For particular reasons a small number are only initiating the process now).<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/div><\/p><p>Finally, the table below outlines the waiting period (in months), up to 1 September 2013, for persons awaiting a first or second consultation at the various Law Centres in the State, and may be of assistance to the Deputy.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Law Centre<\/b><\/th><th><b>Waiting times (months) *<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>General - Law centres not operating triage<\/b><\/th><th><b>Waiting times (months) **<\/b><br \/><br \/><b> for a triage appointment<\/b><\/th><th><b>Further waiting time (months) ***<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>where triage appointment previously given<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Brunswick St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>13<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gardiner St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>0<\/b><\/td><td><b>19<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>12<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Popes Quay<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Mall<\/td><td><b>14<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ennis<\/td><td><b>15<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><b>8<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>0<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Navan<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nenagh<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newbridge<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tralee<\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tullamore<\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>8<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><i>* waiting times for centres not operating the triage approach.<\/i><\/p><p><i>** waiting times for centres operating the triage approach.<\/i><\/p><p><i>***additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.<\/i><bi>  <\/bi><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Expenditure","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[40088\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the costs or the funding of criminal legal aid in each year from 2004 to date, inclusive; the number of instances in respect of which such aid was refused in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The EWS has a current staffing complement of 74 officers delivering front line services, 2 of whom have distinct duties in relation to the education of children in places other than recognised schools.<\/p><p>Table 1 details the existing EWS distribution by regional office location, grade and officer numbers.<\/p><p>I am advised by the NEWB that the EWS worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer (EWO) and a multidisciplinary approach in order to address the complex barriers to school attendance.<\/p><p>The NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (EWS); Home School Community Liaison Programme (HSCL &ndash; 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (SCP &ndash; &euro;26.456m in funding provided to support 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. As part of this process the NEWB is also reviewing the basis on which the EWS was originally configured and a full consultation process is underway with EWS staff and their representatives to reconfigure and optimise service delivery to ensure an appropriate correlation between EWO resources, student population and their needs. I see this strategic national approach as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.<\/p><p>Vacancies that arise in staffing front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving are prioritised by my Department in so far as possible working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment.<\/p><p>The NEWB has a statutory remit to monitor school attendance. The Board's latest report on the Analysis of School Attendance Data, for the school year 2010 &ndash; 2011, is due to be published in November of this year. I understand that this latest data shows a continued improvement in student attendance from 09\/10 and previous years. The number of school days being missed is at the lowest for the five year period 2006\/07 &ndash; 2010\/11 and while further improvements are required the positive trends over recent years are to be welcomed. This evidence further demonstrates the positive impact of targeted investment programmes to improving educational outcomes for children and the positive results that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of schools, parents, statutory and support services.<\/p><p>Table 1<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Regional Office <\/th><th>Sub offices covered in region<\/th><th>EWOs<\/th><th>SEWOs<\/th><th>Regional Managers<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>vacancy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leinster North \/ Ulster <\/td><td>Blanchardstown, Cavan, Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>vacancy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leinster South<\/td><td>Tallaght, Bray, Clondalkin, Naas, Carlow, Clondalkin, Kilkenny,Waterford, Wexford<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Munster<\/td><td>Cork City, Skibbereen, Limerick, Thurles, Tralee, Ennis<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>West \/ North West<\/td><td>Galway City, Castlebar, Sligo, Donegal Town, Longford Town, Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Mullingar<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Totals <\/td><td>30 office locations<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRAA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[40023\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to extend the age to which the State provides care to children in State care from 17 to 18.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>Under Section 3 of the ,  has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. <\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRDD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[40127\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500073#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Donegal has been kept waiting on a referral from Letterkenny General Hospital to Castlebar Hospital since March 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.<\/p><p>  Under the school meals local projects scheme, funding is provided towards breakfast\/snack, lunch and\/or dinner clubs.  It is the responsibility of the school\/organisation as to which club they choose to operate.  In the academic year 2012\/13 there were approximately 550 breakfast\/snack clubs funded under the school meals local projects scheme out of a total of over 2,000 food clubs.  The Department is currently in the process of finalising applications from some additional 80 schools to the scheme for the new school year. <\/p><p>  Priority for funding under the school meals locals projects scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  Following the provision of the additional &euro;2 million funding this year, the Department wrote to approximately 170 DEIS schools encouraging expressions of interest in participating in the school meals scheme for the current school year.  The Department also contacted a further 11 schools\/groups who had previously made an application to join the scheme inviting them to participate in the scheme for the final term of the 2012\/2013 school year &ndash; which one group, a School Completion Programme in Co. Wicklow accepted and joined the scheme during May 2013.<\/p><p>  In addition to the schools meals programme, the Department, through its child and social inclusion policy division, provided funding of &euro;22,500 in the form of a social inclusion grant to Healthy Food for All (HFfA) in 2013.  The purpose of this funding is to support programme activities aimed at improving access to a healthy and affordable diet.  The HFfA's breakfast club initiative is one of a number of programme activities co-ordinated nationally by HFfA to address food poverty in local schools and communities.  This food poverty initiative adds value to the Government&rsquo;s investment in the school meals programme. <\/p><p>  I am fully supportive of these programmes that aim to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, by reason of lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500074#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Administration","counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500074#WRO00925"},{"type":"question","counter":606,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[39859\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500074#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will extend the closing date for accepting applications for JobBridge in the education sector following her announcement of extending the duration of internships; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[39908\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500074#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the policy rationale underpinning the decision to expand JobBridge internships to 18 months.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[39909\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500074#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide a list of all employers that have availed of JobBridge to date; the number of interns each has taken on; the duration of each of these internships.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 107 and 108 together.<\/p><p>  On 18<sup>th<\/sup> September, I announced that the maximum cumulative duration of internships would be extended to 18 months.  The maximum duration of individual internships will remain 9 months.  Individuals will be able to avail of up to 3 internships.  Individuals will be permitted to undertake a maximum of one internship with a particular Host Organisation.  These changes reflect both the recommendations contained in the independent evaluation of JobBridge published by the Taoiseach and myself on 1<sup>st<\/sup> May, 2013, and a significant demand from interns and other individuals made directly to me.  This change will be of significant benefit to jobseekers as it will provide jobseekers who may be dissatisfied with their jobBridge placement more flexibility in finding a suitable alternative placement. <\/p><p>  However, those changes have not yet come into force.  When they do come into force it will be announced on the Home Page of the JobBridge website .  In relation to Education Sector internships, Host organisations can apply for internships in the Education sector, for the current academic year, up to 6<sup>th<\/sup> December 2013.  This provides sufficient lead-in time for these organisations to advertise appropriate internship opportunities. <\/p><p>  At 19<sup>th<\/sup> September, there had been 20,912 placements since the scheme commenced.  Some 91% of all these placements have had an advertised duration of 9 months.

In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.<\/p><p>  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500078#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500079#WRT00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Supports","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500079#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[39868\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500079#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will ensure there are no cuts to the allocation for homeless accommodation in the Budget 2014, as this funding is essential to underpin the commitment to end long-term homelessness by 2016 using a housing-led approach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In Louth, 15 properties made available by NAMA were purchased by Tuath Housing Association, using the Capital Advance Leasing Facility, and became operational in September 2012. \u00a0A further 12 apartments, directly leased by Drogheda Borough Council, also became operational in September 2012.  NAMA continues to work closely with my Department, the Housing Agency and with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in relation to the delivery of social housing.  To date, NAMA has identified over 4,300 residential properties, controlled by its debtors and receivers, under this initiative as being potentially available for social housing.  Demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,899 of these properties with a further 291 properties currently being evaluated, bringing the total that may be deemed potentially suitable to 2,190.  The local authorities have confirmed that of the properties identified, 1,359 are considered unsuitable by reference to sustainable planning and housing policy or are located in areas with no demand.\u00a0 More than 800 other properties have been sold or privately let by their owners or receivers since they were identified by NAMA.   <\/p><p>  There is considerable complexity in dealing with multiple property transfers with varying degrees of difficulty attached to them.  In the main, this is due to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints.

I do not consider it possible to introduce amending primary legislation to provide for an extension to the deadline or to provide for an exemption for particular categories of vehicles at this late stage, and indeed, it would be difficult to make the necessary technical adjustments to the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) within the short timescale involved.  Further, exempting or extending the deadline for one particular category would inevitably lead to similar calls from other groups of road user. <\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of lost registration books , motor tax offices have been advised that, in order to facilitate the processing of declarations of non-use, applications should not be rejected on the basis that there is no registration document number on the application form, providing the application is otherwise in order and the vehicle and owner details correspond with the record of the vehicle on the NVDF.   <\/p><p>  For owners of vehicles recorded on the NVDF who are unable to locate the registration document for the vehicle, an application for a replacement document may be made at any time using Form RF134, which is available from motor tax offices or for download from .  It will not be necessary to do so before 30 September.   <\/p><p>  However, a registration book will be required, along with a Notification of Transfer of Vehicle Ownership, prior to the making of a declaration of non-use of a vehicle, in instances where the owner wishing to make the declaration of non-use is not the registered owner of the vehicle. <\/p><p>  A registration book may also be requested by the Motor Tax Office in instances where there is no record of the vehicle on the National and Vehicle Driver File (NVDF).

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.  <\/p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.<\/p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy I will refer him to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 1098 set down for written answer on 18 September 2013 which is detailed below.<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I wish to inform the Deputy that there is no waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid as under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid on the applicant's appearance in Court.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In relation to civil legal aid, it should be noted that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. (I have included below a table showing the waiting times for non prioritised matters at the Board&rsquo;s law centres. It will be noted that most of the centres are operating the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach. For particular reasons a small number are only initiating the process now).<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/div><\/p><p>Finally, the table below outlines the waiting period (in months), up to 1 September 2013, for persons awaiting a first or second consultation at the various Law Centres in the State, and may be of assistance to the Deputy.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Law Centre<\/b><\/th><th><b>Waiting times (months) *<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>General - Law centres not operating triage<\/b><\/th><th><b>Waiting times (months) **<\/b><br \/><br \/><b> for a triage appointment<\/b><\/th><th><b>Further waiting time (months) ***<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>where triage appointment previously given<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Brunswick St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>13<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gardiner St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>0<\/b><\/td><td><b>19<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>12<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Popes Quay<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Mall<\/td><td><b>14<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ennis<\/td><td><b>15<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><b>8<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>0<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Navan<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nenagh<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newbridge<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tralee<\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tullamore<\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>8<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><i>* waiting times for centres not operating the triage approach.<\/i><\/p><p><i>** waiting times for centres operating the triage approach.<\/i><\/p><p><i>***additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.<\/i><bi>  <\/bi><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500084#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Expenditure","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500084#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[40088\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500084#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the costs or the funding of criminal legal aid in each year from 2004 to date, inclusive; the number of instances in respect of which such aid was refused in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The EWS has a current staffing complement of 74 officers delivering front line services, 2 of whom have distinct duties in relation to the education of children in places other than recognised schools.<\/p><p>Table 1 details the existing EWS distribution by regional office location, grade and officer numbers.<\/p><p>I am advised by the NEWB that the EWS worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer (EWO) and a multidisciplinary approach in order to address the complex barriers to school attendance.<\/p><p>The NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (EWS); Home School Community Liaison Programme (HSCL &ndash; 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (SCP &ndash; &euro;26.456m in funding provided to support 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. As part of this process the NEWB is also reviewing the basis on which the EWS was originally configured and a full consultation process is underway with EWS staff and their representatives to reconfigure and optimise service delivery to ensure an appropriate correlation between EWO resources, student population and their needs. I see this strategic national approach as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.<\/p><p>Vacancies that arise in staffing front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving are prioritised by my Department in so far as possible working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment.<\/p><p>The NEWB has a statutory remit to monitor school attendance. The Board's latest report on the Analysis of School Attendance Data, for the school year 2010 &ndash; 2011, is due to be published in November of this year. I understand that this latest data shows a continued improvement in student attendance from 09\/10 and previous years. The number of school days being missed is at the lowest for the five year period 2006\/07 &ndash; 2010\/11 and while further improvements are required the positive trends over recent years are to be welcomed. This evidence further demonstrates the positive impact of targeted investment programmes to improving educational outcomes for children and the positive results that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of schools, parents, statutory and support services.<\/p><p>Table 1<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Regional Office <\/th><th>Sub offices covered in region<\/th><th>EWOs<\/th><th>SEWOs<\/th><th>Regional Managers<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>vacancy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leinster North \/ Ulster <\/td><td>Blanchardstown, Cavan, Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>vacancy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leinster South<\/td><td>Tallaght, Bray, Clondalkin, Naas, Carlow, Clondalkin, Kilkenny,Waterford, Wexford<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Munster<\/td><td>Cork City, Skibbereen, Limerick, Thurles, Tralee, Ennis<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>West \/ North West<\/td><td>Galway City, Castlebar, Sligo, Donegal Town, Longford Town, Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Mullingar<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Totals <\/td><td>30 office locations<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500084#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":837,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500084#WRAA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":838,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[40023\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500084#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to extend the age to which the State provides care to children in State care from 17 to 18.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":839,"content":"<p>Under Section 3 of the ,  has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. <\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.<\/p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy I will refer him to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 1098 set down for written answer on 18 September 2013 which is detailed below.<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I wish to inform the Deputy that there is no waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid as under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid on the applicant's appearance in Court.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In relation to civil legal aid, it should be noted that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&ldquo;the Board&rdquo;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy. While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board earlier this year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">As the Deputy may be aware, on 12 September 2013, I signed into law a new statutory instrument in respect of civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board which, inter alia, provides for an increased contribution from persons availing of the services offered by the Board.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I intend for any funds raised by these measures to be retained by the Board to better fund the provision of services to those in need of them and reduce waiting times for those services. At a time when the State is facing significant demands on its resources an increase in contributions allows the Board to achieve its objectives without money being diverted from other programmes. The increased contributions should result in increased funding of up to &euro;700,000 per annum being available to the Board once the increases have full impact.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">I believe this additional resource for the Board will assist it in tackling those waiting times. I am conscious that the increase in the minimum contribution as a percentage is significant.  However, I believe the contributions payable still compare favourably with other jurisdictions. Provisions remain in place to allow the contribution to be waived in hardship cases.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. (I have included below a table showing the waiting times for non prioritised matters at the Board&rsquo;s law centres. It will be noted that most of the centres are operating the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach. For particular reasons a small number are only initiating the process now).<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court.  Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area such as the Courts Service and the Health Service Executive, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/div><\/p><p>Finally, the table below outlines the waiting period (in months), up to 1 September 2013, for persons awaiting a first or second consultation at the various Law Centres in the State, and may be of assistance to the Deputy.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Law Centre<\/b><\/th><th><b>Waiting times (months) *<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>General - Law centres not operating triage<\/b><\/th><th><b>Waiting times (months) **<\/b><br \/><br \/><b> for a triage appointment<\/b><\/th><th><b>Further waiting time (months) ***<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>where triage appointment previously given<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Brunswick St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>13<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gardiner St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>0<\/b><\/td><td><b>19<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>12<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Popes Quay<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Mall<\/td><td><b>14<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ennis<\/td><td><b>15<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><b>8<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>0<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><b>4<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Navan<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><td><b>2<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nenagh<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>5<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newbridge<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><b>11<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>3<\/b><\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tralee<\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tullamore<\/td><td><b>6<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td><b>7<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><b>9<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>1<\/b><\/td><td><b>8<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><i>* waiting times for centres not operating the triage approach.<\/i><\/p><p><i>** waiting times for centres operating the triage approach.<\/i><\/p><p><i>***additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.<\/i><bi>  <\/bi><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500085#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Expenditure","counter":940,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500085#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":941,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[40088\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500085#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the costs or the funding of criminal legal aid in each year from 2004 to date, inclusive; the number of instances in respect of which such aid was refused in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The EWS has a current staffing complement of 74 officers delivering front line services, 2 of whom have distinct duties in relation to the education of children in places other than recognised schools.<\/p><p>Table 1 details the existing EWS distribution by regional office location, grade and officer numbers.<\/p><p>I am advised by the NEWB that the EWS worked with over 20,000 children in 2012, of which 2,420 were intensive interventions which required sustained support from an Education Welfare Officer (EWO) and a multidisciplinary approach in order to address the complex barriers to school attendance.<\/p><p>The NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (EWS); Home School Community Liaison Programme (HSCL &ndash; 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (SCP &ndash; &euro;26.456m in funding provided to support 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. As part of this process the NEWB is also reviewing the basis on which the EWS was originally configured and a full consultation process is underway with EWS staff and their representatives to reconfigure and optimise service delivery to ensure an appropriate correlation between EWO resources, student population and their needs. I see this strategic national approach as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.<\/p><p>Vacancies that arise in staffing front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving are prioritised by my Department in so far as possible working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment.<\/p><p>The NEWB has a statutory remit to monitor school attendance. The Board's latest report on the Analysis of School Attendance Data, for the school year 2010 &ndash; 2011, is due to be published in November of this year. I understand that this latest data shows a continued improvement in student attendance from 09\/10 and previous years. The number of school days being missed is at the lowest for the five year period 2006\/07 &ndash; 2010\/11 and while further improvements are required the positive trends over recent years are to be welcomed. This evidence further demonstrates the positive impact of targeted investment programmes to improving educational outcomes for children and the positive results that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of schools, parents, statutory and support services.<\/p><p>Table 1<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Regional Office <\/th><th>Sub offices covered in region<\/th><th>EWOs<\/th><th>SEWOs<\/th><th>Regional Managers<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>vacancy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leinster North \/ Ulster <\/td><td>Blanchardstown, Cavan, Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>vacancy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leinster South<\/td><td>Tallaght, Bray, Clondalkin, Naas, Carlow, Clondalkin, Kilkenny,Waterford, Wexford<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Munster<\/td><td>Cork City, Skibbereen, Limerick, Thurles, Tralee, Ennis<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>West \/ North West<\/td><td>Galway City, Castlebar, Sligo, Donegal Town, Longford Town, Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Mullingar<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Totals <\/td><td>30 office locations<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500086#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":965,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500086#WRAA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":966,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[40023\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500086#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to extend the age to which the State provides care to children in State care from 17 to 18.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":967,"content":"<p>Under Section 3 of the ,  has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.

The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether or not &quot;undue hardship&quot; exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or his or her dependents. <\/p><p>  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. <\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500089#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1020,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500089#WRDD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1021,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[40127\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092500089#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Donegal has been kept waiting on a referral from Letterkenny General Hospital to Castlebar Hospital since March 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
