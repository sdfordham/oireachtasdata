Small area renewable energy projects feed into the distribution network.  The Distribution System Operator (DSO) and owner in Ireland is ESB Networks.  ESB Networks has a webpage which explains to the public how to connect a microgenerator, which is the main type of small area renewable energy project.  This page includes a connection guide and outlines the steps involved.  It also contains a series of &ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; for those wishing to connect.  The page also contains a document that sets out the specific Irish protection settings appropriate to the ESB Network, known as EN 50438.<\/p><p>  There is no charge to connect a micro-generator to the ESB network provided it complies with EN50438.  The micro-generator must in addition conform to the conditions governing the connection and operation of micro-generation contained on the ESB webpage.  Generators with an installed capacity of 1MW or less are deemed to be automatically authorised and licensed by the Commission for Energy Regulation under the terms of S.I. 383 and S.I. 384 of 2008 and are subject to the conditions in those orders.  This system was introduced in order to promote microgeneration.  The Department of Environment introduced two statutory instruments that contain planning exemptions for renewable technologies that meet certain criteria.  These were introduced to facilitate microgeneration and are contained in S.I. 83 of 2007 and S.I. 235 of 2008.<\/p><p>  When microgenerators that connect to the distribution system wish to export electricity, they need to install an import\/export meter.  The ESB websites indicate that where a customer requires import\/export metering, they can contact ESB for a quotation for this.  The Commission for Energy Regulation previously wrote to all electricity suppliers in Ireland inviting them to introduce microgeneration tariffs for customers exporting to the grid using microgenerators.  To date, the only company to have introduced such a scheme is Electric Ireland (formerly ESB Customer Supply), which offers a tariff of 9 cent per kilowatt hour for domestic customers under specified conditions.<\/p><p>  In addition, for small area renewable generation projects that can fulfil certain terms and conditions (e.g. have planning permission, have a grid connection and can secure a power purchase agreement (PPA)), the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources operates the REFIT schemes, which are funded from the Public Service Obligation.  Small hydro and biomass projects are included in these schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100047#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100047#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[4603\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100047#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount of oil and gas respectively extracted from Ireland and our territorial waters in 2012; the areas from which that extraction occurred; the estimated value of those resources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>Ireland has three producing gas fields.

Research by Boston Consulting Group cited in the recent UPC report on Ireland&rsquo;s Digital Future, estimates it will grow from a current rate of about 3% to 6% by 2016.  Research currently underway in the context of the National Digital Strategy will look further at this value and ways it might be enhanced.  Specific examples of the importance and potential of the digital economy can also be cited.  As Deputies are aware there is substantial employment in Ireland in the ICT and digital sectors arising from the presence of world leading companies in these areas based in Ireland.  In addition, smaller indigenous companies are also making an important contribution.  For example, the Digital Hub in Dublin currently caters for 66 digital enterprises, which between them employ some 800 people.  More than three-quarters (78%) of these companies expanded their business operations last year, with 44% hiring additional staff.  Two-thirds are planning to expand their workforce this year.  In addition the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) has helped to create 155 full-time jobs and 66 part-time jobs by the end of 2012 as a direct result of the projects it has supported.<\/p><p>  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure, with a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan recognises that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.<\/p><p>  Encouraging citizens to connect to the Internet is a separate but related challenge, and a number of public and private sector measures are already underway in this area.  The most recent Central Statistics Office (CSO) statistics &ndash; published in December last - show that 19% of households do not have an Internet connection.  That is not to say they cannot get an Internet connection.  CSO statistics indicate that not having an Internet connection is primarily a matter of choice by those households &ndash; with respondents in those households mostly indicating they do not want or need access to the Internet.  The issue therefore is substantially one of demand which underlines the importance of awareness raising.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits to the publication of a National Digital Strategy (NDS) aimed at stimulating demand for broadband services and connectivity.  The NDS will focus on the benefits of digital engagement and will build on existing measures to increase awareness amongst citizens, households and business.  As part of the strategy, I recently appointed David Puttnam as Ireland&rsquo;s National Digital Champion.  An important element of engaging citizens is the development of skills.  The &ldquo;BenefIT&rdquo; schemes operated by my Department have worked in partnership with third sector and not-for-profit organisations and has provided basic skills training for over 70,000 people at over 700 locations nationwide.<\/p><p>  My Department is also working in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills to roll out high speed broadband connectivity to all second level schools.  This is already facilitating new possibilities for students and could potentially help to stimulate take up in households.<\/p><p>  The commercial sector also has a strong role to play in stimulating demand for Internet services.  The explosion in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, increased availability of applications such as video-on-demand, and initiatives by Internet services providers to make technology more accessible to targeted segments of society, will continue to impact on the level of take up.  As part of the National Digital Strategy, my Department will work closely with the commercial sector to build on these initiatives, with a view to ensuring that citizens, business and communities realise more fully the potential of a digitally enabled society.  I do not believe that society here is digitally complacent.  The evidence shows that digital engagement continues to grow.  I am, however, very conscious of the further potential and the National Digital Strategy will be looking at ways to add impetus in terms of engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100047#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[4743\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his strategy for wind power; the extent to which he wishes to see it developed onshore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>Under Directive 2009\/28\/EC, Ireland was assigned a legally binding target of 16% by 2020 for the percentage of all energy consumption that must be met from renewable sources.  Ireland intends to meet the overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport, which is a minimum binding target, and 12% renewable heating, which together amount to 16% overall.<\/p><p>  In terms of the 40% renewable electricity to be achieved by 2020, the ability to meet this is largely determined by the grid connection offers to renewable generators.  The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  CER published a Gate 3 direction in December 2008, which was specifically designed with the intention of providing for sufficient renewable energy grid connection offers to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  In addition, the CER published a decision on the connection of small, low carbon renewable generators outside the Gate process (CER 09\/99).  This mechanism specifically provides for the ability of small anaerobic digesters, biomass CHP plants, wave and tidal devices and other non-wind renewable low carbon generators to connect to the grid outside of the Gate process by 2020.<\/p><p>  The Gate 3 grid connection direction includes a list of specific renewable generating projects to receive grid connections.  The vast bulk of these are onshore wind developments.  Hence, onshore wind will make up the bulk of the delivery of the 40% renewable electricity target.  The Government decided in 2012 that an offshore wind feed-in-tariff (REFIT) would not be offered at this time.  REFIT is available as a support from onshore wind projects.  Accordingly, in meeting our legal obligation to deliver the 2020 renewables target, the policy focus and incentive relates to onshore wind.  The REFIT support for onshore wind is significantly less than what would be required for offshore wind.  It is borne by electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation.<\/p><p>  In the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) modelling indicated that 3,521 MW of wind would be needed on the electricity grid by 2020 in order to achieve our 40% renewable electricity target.  This is approximately a doubling on current levels of wind generation.  In addition, the NREAP progress report modelling also forecasts other technologies contributing to our 40% target - 274 MW of biomass technologies by 2020 as well as 75 MW of wave and tidal technology.  It is evident, however, that wind generated electricity is expected to play a pivotal role and this will be overwhelmingly onshore wind.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ed Davey, and I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in energy last week.  This MoU is a signal of intent.  It gives us an opportunity to fully consider how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the UK.  The MoU commits us to a programme of work and a possible formal Inter-Governmental agreement with the UK if it is considered mutually beneficial to enter such an agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[4760\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his priorities for 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>My Department deals with a very wide and complex policy agenda encompassing the areas of Energy, Communications, Broadcasting, Postal and Natural Resources.

To date, these media have not been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There is a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.<\/p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the economic and social benefits that the widespread use of social media have brought to people, communities and to business.  However, some of the issues that have arisen as a consequence of this bear consideration.  These challenges include dealing with harassment and bullying online, as well as issues around defamation, data protection and even copyright.  There has been a very considerable amount of discussion on these matters in the recent past at EU and Council of Europe level, in which my Department has been involved.  Indeed this matter is also the subject of a fundamental debate at EU and national level at present, a fact reflected by the recent decision of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to examine the issue.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have policy responsibility for providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment to facilitate the development of high quality communications infrastructure and services.  However, I should highlight that I do not have sole responsibility for addressing as to how that infrastructure is used.  Responsibility, in the context of abuse over the Internet in particular, also sits with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the executive agency of his Department, the Office for Internet Safety.<\/p><p>  It is clear that there are no simple answers to the challenges posed by the development and abuse of social media, not least because of the international basis of the services and because any possible policy responses fall across a range of Government Departments.  In recognition of this complexity my Department maintains open and regular contact with all Departments and State Agencies with responsibilities in this area.  My Department also monitors international developments with a view to ensuring that domestic policy within its remit reflects best practice and that the regulatory framework is amended as necessary.  In that regard, I look forward to the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, and I also look forward to meeting the Committee on this subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB01050"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[4756\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he is satisfied with the availability of broadband nationwide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure, with a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.

Specifically, it commits to:<\/p><p>  - 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>  - At least 40 Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% - and potentially as much as 35% - of the population, and <\/p><p>  - A minimum of 30 Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country. <\/p><p>  It is not possible for me to say how these targets will compare to the speeds that will prevail in other countries.  It is the case, in Europe and elsewhere, that all countries are seeking solutions to the challenge of rolling out high speed services.  It is Ireland&rsquo;s intention to achieve the EU target of 30 Mbps to all, well ahead of the target date of 2020.  In any event, when making comparisons of speeds with other countries, care needs to be taken to compare like with like.  In Ireland we have a highly dispersed low density population which is in contrast to some other countries, for example in Scandinavia, which have a low population density but whose population is not as highly dispersed.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.

The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.

It is estimated that at least 8.4% of the energy in transport in Ireland in 2020 will come from the use of biofuels with the remainder achieved by the increased deployment of electric vehicles.  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of biofuels to the market. The scheme was introduced with an obligation on fuel suppliers to include at least 4% by volume biofuels in their overall disposal of road transport fuels.  In order to maintain progress towards achieving the 2020 targets, I increased the obligation to 6% by volume with effect from 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>  Recently, the European Commission circulated a proposal to amend sections of the Renewable Energy Directive.  This proposal is currently being progressed and is one of the major agenda items for the Irish presidency of the EU.  One of the amendments proposed is that no more than 5% of the energy in the transport sector should come from biofuels produced from certain crops.  My Department is currently examining the proposal and its implications for meeting the target of 10% renewable energy by 2020.  However, there are no implications for the current obligation rate of 6% as the overall energy content delivered by the obligation will not breach the proposed 5%. The obligation rate of 6% will remain the same until the end of 2014.  Decisions on further increases after 2014 will be taken after any amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive have been finalised.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres being placed on the Irish market in 2011.  Of this, approximately 18.5 million litres was produced indigenously from waste material such as used cooking oil.  Though figures for 2012 are not yet available, I understand that the amount of indigenous biofuel on the market increased last year.  The recent increase in the obligation rate along with future increases will see the biofuel market grow to an estimated 500 million litres by 2020.  This will continue to create opportunities for indigenous industry to produce biofuels here in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Exports","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[4601\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will outline the terms of the negotiations that have taken place between him and his British counterpart on the development of a Memorandum of Understanding on trade in renewable energy; if said memorandum is close to being finalised; the main aims of the memorandum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[4677\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the Exchequer funds that will be provided for the construction of wind turbines following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between his Department and the British Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[4763\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the agreement with the UK to export wind energy from Ireland.","asker":"954","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 27 and 43 together. <\/p><p>  On 24 January 2013, UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ed Davey, and I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Dublin on energy cooperation. A copy of the MoU is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The MoU we signed affirms the two States&rsquo; commitment to maintaining a strong partnership on energy issues, to achieving closer integration of electricity markets and to maximising the sustainable use of renewable energy resources.  Ireland has the potential to generate far more wind energy than we could consume domestically.  This MoU gives us an opportunity to fully consider how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p>  The Renewable Directive provides a number of mechanisms that can be used by Member States for the trade of renewable energy, including joint projects and statistical transfer.  Joint projects are where specified projects located in one country may be counted towards the renewable energy target of another. Statistical transfer is where the excess relating to an overachievement of the target by one country may be sold to another country that has fallen short of its target. The mechanisms require an Inter-Governmental agreement to be put in place. Up to now, while electricity could be exported between jurisdictions, the renewable value in terms of target compliance remained in the country where the renewable energy was produced.  The Directive, for the first time, introduced the concept of the trade in the renewable value of electricity.<\/p><p>  The opportunity to export green power presents an opportunity for employment growth and export earnings as well as increased investment for Ireland.  There are and will be no Government funds allocated for the construction of wind turbines whether output is for internal or external consumption. In particular, Irish consumers cannot be required to finance electricity that is destined for export.  The price that the UK is willing to pay for the renewable power will need to be sufficient to cover any support mechanism needed by project developers and to finance the new transmission infrastructure required.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the MoU is an important signal of intent and an interim step.  There is no formal Inter-Governmental agreement under the Directive in place yet.  There are many complex engineering, market, regulatory and policy issues that need to be teased out, discussed and considered prior to making an Inter-Governmental agreement that provides a formal basis for energy trading.  The cost benefit analysis must support that the trading proposition makes sense.  Nevertheless it is clear that there are significant potential economic and employment benefits arising for both jurisdictions.  Both countries have accordingly agreed on an urgent programme of work over the next year to determine the final contents of any formal Inter-Governmental agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":45,"content":"<p>Question No. 17 answered with Question No. 15.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gas and Electricity Disconnections","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[4596\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100048#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has been briefed by CER on their latest statistics on the level of gas disconnections taking place across the country; his views on whether a reinvigorated fuel poverty strategy may be necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>I have no statutory function in the setting of gas prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.  The rise in utility disconnection numbers in recent years has coincided with the economic recession which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.  The CER regularly briefs me on electricity and gas disconnection reports.  I can advise that the Regulator has recently briefed me on the level of gas disconnections.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figures for gas disconnections show that BGE gas disconnections have approximately doubled from 2011 to 2012, while Flogas and Airtricity also show increases in gas disconnections.  It is the view of the CER that the issue of vacant premises, where customers leave premises empty and a utilities debt unpaid, is also contributing to an overstatement of customer disconnections.  However, it is accepted that it is difficult to quantify the precise numbers.<\/p><p><br \/>  In response to the significant increases in disconnections since 2010, a number of measures have been put in place by the CER to address the issue and assist customers that are in financial hardship and facing disconnections.  In line with the CER&#8217;s Code of Practice on disconnection, gas suppliers must facilitate payment options\/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter if this is possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  Over the past few years the CER has been working with stakeholders to promote the installation of prepayment or Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) meters in order to assist customers through their financial difficulties.  For example, CER is facilitating a new process within St Vincent de Paul (VdeP) which will see its members encourage households at risk of disconnection to opt for a PAYG meter, to manage debt and assist budgeting, instead of the VdeP paying the overdue amount in the first instance.  This is expected to be rolled out from next month.  The CER also intends to engage with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to establish if there is scope to build in PAYG installations to social housing administration processes.  Following a recent review, the CER has decided to extend to 31 December 2013 the obligation on suppliers to pay 50% of the costs of disconnections\/reconnection of domestic customers.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The key message for consumers in genuine difficulty is to make contact with their supplier and agree a plan before the unpaid bills begin to accumulate thus obviate the risk of disconnection. <\/p><p>Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>  Energy Strategy is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental\/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Department&#8217;s commitment in the Programme for Government to help address energy poverty.  The Strategy is not required to be reinvigorated as it is a comprehensive plan that addresses all the major areas identified to help mitigate energy poverty.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the life-time of the report (3 years).

Prior to this, applicants were considered eligible for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme. The IDGAE worked with key stakeholders to establish new eligibility criteria to target those most in need.  International research demonstrates that the elderly and pre-school children are most at risk.

This target has to be meet across the electricity, transport and heating sectors and a minimum of 10% in the transport sector is required. Ireland intends to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which amounts to 16% of overall energy consumption, commensurate with our target.<\/p><p>  In terms of the 40% renewable electricity to be achieved by 2020, the ability to meet this is largely determined by the grid connection offers to renewable generators.  The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  CER published a Gate 3 direction in December 2008, which was specifically designed with the intention of providing for sufficient renewable energy grid connection offers to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  In addition, the CER published a decision on the connection of small, low carbon renewable generators outside the Gate process (CER 09\/99.) This mechanism specifically provides for the ability of small anaerobic digesters, biomass CHP plants, wave and tidal devices and other non-wind renewable low carbon generators to connect to the grid outside of the Gate process by 2020.<\/p><p>  The Gate 3 grid connection direction includes a list of specific renewable generating projects to receive grid connections.  It can be seen that the vast bulk of these are onshore wind developments.  Hence, wind will make up the bulk of the delivery of the 40% renewable electricity target.  In the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) modelling indicated that 3,521MW of wind would be needed on the electricity grid by 2020 in order to achieve our 40% renewable electricity target.  This is approximately a doubling on the current position.<\/p><p>  In addition, the NREAP progress report modelling also forecasts other technologies contributing to our 40% renewable electricity target - 274MW of biomass technologies by 2020 as well as 75MW of wave and tidal technology.  Hydro is expected to contribute 234MW in 2020, largely made up of the large hydropower stations and some smaller generators.  There are several very small hydropower stations already operational in the REFIT schemes.  Wave and tidal energy is still at the RD&amp;D stage of development, however, it is anticipated that some early devices will be available by 2020.  The biomass REFIT 3 scheme opened in 2012 and provides for up to 310MW of biomass generated electricity.  The volume of applications received to date has been positive.<\/p><p>  The target set under Directive 2009\/28\/EC is 16% of all energy consumption to be from renewable sources by 2020, up from 3.1% in 2005.  At the end of 2012, SEAI estimates that 6.4% of consumption was from renewable sources.  Achieving our 2020 target will be challenging, however I am confident that it can still be reached.  The rapid development of 2nd generation biofuels will be critical in terms of renewable transport, while maintaining our grid development and grid build on track will be essential if we are to double the renewable electricity on our grid in the next 8 years.<\/p><p>  In terms of transport, over the coming years, we will see an increase in the number of Electric Vehicles becoming available.  To date, in Ireland, only a very limited number of full battery Electric Vehicle models have been available for consumers.  I expect, possibly later this year, to see the introduction of Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles.  Plugin Hybrids use both a battery and an internal combustion engine to power the vehicle using two different types of technology.  One is an advanced version of hybrid technology which has been available for some years now, where the vehicle is powered by the battery and the engine takes over as the power in the battery drops.  Unlike previous hybrids, Plugin Hybrids can be recharged by mains electricity between journeys thus reducing the requirement for the engine to do the same.  The other technology uses the engine as a backup generator so that the vehicle is constantly powered by electricity.  In this area, I also expect to see battery technology improve and journey ranges increase.  I would also expect to see vehicles developed that can run on higher blends of biofuels. Most new petrol vehicles can now run on blends of up to 10% biofuel with diesels capable of handling up to 7% biodiesel.<\/p><p>  Another area where we will see developments is in relation to vehicles being fuelled by gaseous fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), biogas and biomethane.  Though CNG is a fossil fuel, it is cleaner than petrol or diesel producing between 11 and 20 per cent lower carbon emissions per unit of energy produced than diesel.  Biogas, which can be produced locally by anaerobic digestion of waste and plant material, can also be used in certain vehicles, including some which run on CNG.  Furthermore, biogas can be further processed to produce biomethane which can be used as a direct substitute for any Natural Gas product not only in the transport sector, but in the heat and electricity sectors also.  Hydrogen is another fuel which is being looked at by some major motor manufacturers as a fuel for the future but it is uncertain when this technology will become widely available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100049#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":59,"content":"<p>Question No. 22 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100049#WRC00900"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[4604\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100049#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he is satisfied with the current arrangements and supports for the extraction of oil and gas in Ireland's territorial waters; his plans for changes in this policy area in the coming year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>Ireland operates a model where the State provides the opportunity and private industry bears the risk associated with investing in exploration activity.

Supervision of the grid connection process is vested in the CER.  Aside from microgeneration that meets specified criteria, all applications by wind generators for connection to the electricity network are processed through the Gate process.<\/p><p>  The CER established the Group Processing Approach known as the &lsquo;Gate&rsquo; process for applications for grid connections.  This means that grid connections in Ireland are processed in batches rather than sequentially.  Within these gates, applications are further divided into groups and sub-groups based on the optimal network required to connect them.  This approach is considered a more efficient process than dealing with applications on an individual basis where projects which are the subject of such applications interact with each other electrically and where large volumes of such applications exist.  The group processing approach allows for a more strategic view to be taken of network requirements and serves to put in place efficient connection solutions to cater for large number of applications and to ensure optimum network development, minimising network costs and, where possible, avoidance of network bottlenecks.<\/p><p>  To date, CER has put in place 3 'Gates.' Under Gate 1 and Gate 2, 1755MW of connection offers were made and accepted.  Under Gate 3, almost 4000MW of offers issued to renewable generators.  A Gate 3 liaison group involving EirGrid, ESB Networks, CER and industry representatives meets on a regular basis.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s latest estimates are that around 4,000MW of renewable generation is required on the electricity network by 2020 to deliver our 40% renewable electricity target.  The total amount of renewable generation in the 3 Gates is well above that amount.<\/p><p>  While the take up of Gate 3 offers is not clear at this stage, largely as a result of ongoing consultations on the Single Electricity Market (SEM) Committee scheduling and dispatch rules, even with some fall off, sufficient offers appear to have already issued to ensure that our target can be achieved.  The implementation of Gate 3 requires a significant amount of grid build and grid upgrade, which will be challenging to achieve in the period to 2020. EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 implementation plans are designed to augment and improve the grid in order to connect the Gate 3 grid connection offers and to deliver on our 2020 targets.  Any decision on a future Gate for new wind generators would have to be considered in the context of the processes already underway.<\/p><p>  Apart from the above, the CER published a decision in 2009 (CER 09\/099) that allows for certain renewable, small and low carbon generators to connect to the transmission and distribution grids without going through the full rigours of the Gate process.  This includes small projects, research and development projects and those that qualify as they are deemed to provide benefits of a public nature that merit qualification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100049#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100049#WRC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[4680\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100049#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason Ireland is behind other European countries in access to high speed broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure, with a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.

In November 2012 ComReg announced the results of its successful Multi-Band Spectrum Award (MBSA) process which resulted in a transfer of &euro;450 million, in respect of upfront fees accrued, to the Exchequer on 14 December 2012.  The remainder of the total licence yield of some &euro;855 million will be paid on an annual basis over the duration of the terms of the licences.<\/p><p>  As part of this process ComReg awarded spectrum rights of use across three critical bands &ndash; the 800Mhz, 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands &ndash; for the period 2013 to 2030.  These spectrum bands are highly suitable for advanced mobile services due to their excellent propagation properties, which allow for wide area coverage and improved in-building reception.  Liberalised spectrum rights of use were won by the four existing Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), namely: Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd.; Meteor Mobile Communications Ltd.; Telefonica Ireland Ltd; and Vodafone Ireland Ltd.  It is a condition of a Liberalised Use Licence that a minimum 70% population coverage obligation is to be achieved by a licensee within 3 years of its licence commencement date.<\/p><p>  ComReg set out the process it has adopted for the award of rights of use for radio frequencies in the 800Mhz, 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands in its information memorandum and associated documents (ComReg document 12\/52).  These documents also set out the reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its substantive decisions regarding the minimum coverage and rollout requirements for the rights of use to be granted in the award process.  Amongst other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed a minimum 70% population obligation given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the current levels.<\/p><p>  In this context, the Deputy may wish to note that the four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their respective licences.  For example, for 3G services, Vodafone&rsquo;s coverage covers 90% of the population, 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as &ldquo;3&rdquo;, covers 96% of the population, 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers 90.5% of the population, which is also more than its obligation.<\/p><p>  ComReg has also advised me that coverage continues to be an important differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market such that any material deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network&rsquo;s attractiveness to its existing and potential customers.  It is also important to emphasise that the coverage proposals were designed to facilitate the possible entry of new operators in a matter that would ensure that &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; of high density urban areas would not occur.  While the four Liberalised Use Licences of the Mobile Network Operators are due to commence on 1 February 2013, the timing and extent of each of &lsquo;4G&rsquo; (Long Term Evolution (LTE)) network rollout is, with the exception of the above coverage obligation, a matter for the operators themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[4676\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there are regulations regarding the height of wind turbines here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for developing planning policy and legislation.

Approximately half of the deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisonings result from the inhalation of smoke from fires.  Other significant causes are vehicle exhausts and deaths in industrial \/ commercial settings.  In recent years between two and six people died each year in Ireland from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning in the home, in incidents related to domestic heating or other fossil fuel installations in the home.<\/p><p>  Carbon monoxide is not just an issue for those using gas as their fuel source.  The incomplete combustion of organic fossil fuels such as oil, coal or wood, as well as gas, is a common cause of carbon monoxide formation, and is responsible for many cases of non-fatal unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning.  In normal conditions, the combustion process will result in carbon in the fossil fuel combining with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide, the same substance we exhale when we breathe.  However, if there is a lack of air for the combustion process or the heating appliance is faulty, carbon monoxide can be produced.<\/p><p>  Approximately six incidents involving, or potentially involving, carbon monoxide gas have been reported in Ireland in the past 12 months.  The exact number will be known when the report for quarter four 2012 issues from the Commissioner for Energy Regulation (CER) next month.  As investigations into some of the incidents reported last year have not been concluded; it may not possible to determine by next month that they did indeed involve carbon monoxide.  Given the clear need to act to prevent accidents and mitigate risks, I launched the first Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week on the 24 September 2012.  This involved a week which saw a sustained, multi-media publicity campaign to alert people to the dangers and give them advice as to what they should do to be safe. The issue was widely reported on television, on national and local radio and in both national and local press.  <\/p><p>  Additionally my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has recently revised the Building Regulations so that it will become compulsory to fit approved carbon monoxide alarms to certain types of new building.  A lot of work has been done on the relevant standards that apply to these alarms, both at national and at European level.  The Gas Technical Standards Committee of the National Standards Authority of Ireland is currently working on guidance documentation to assist with proper installation of such alarms.  They also issued a special standard to fill the gap until the relevant European Standard can be enhanced.<\/p><p>  I should also highlight the commendable work done by the gas industry to raise safety standards and participate in the establishment of a register of approved gas installers.  This has been a hugely important development in improving quality control in gas matters, including reducing the risk posed by carbon monoxide in gas installations.  This &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; approach to matters relating to carbon monoxide can be well demonstrated by the specific campaign last year to warn the public about gas cookers which could be operated in an unsafe manner, creating a carbon monoxide hazard.  Industry, government, regulator, standards authority and the National Consumer Agency all acted together to identify and promote the risks and the solutions to consumers.  As a result, very many potentially dangerous appliances were identified and made safe.  Finally, I assure the Deputy that I take this matter very seriously, and that I intend to launch this year&rsquo;s Carbon Monoxide Week after the summer.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying of Children","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE01050"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[4742\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the role he can play in cyberbullying; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>The Office of Internet Safety has been established by the Government to take lead responsibility for Internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.

Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and business and domestic customers can as a result avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies operating in the retail market.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the regulation of gas prices the position is that up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  In making its decision on gas tariffs, the CER takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring that only reasonable legitimate costs are recovered by BGE.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher energy prices on residential and commercial consumers.  It is the case however, that Ireland in the main, is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity and gas, which is the key factor in the retail price of both electricity and gas. In particular, Ireland is a price taker for gas. My focus is on those elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.<\/p><p><br \/>  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental\/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Department&#8217;s commitment in the Programme for Government to help mitigate energy poverty.  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the lifetime of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including: a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home; the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation; ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures; reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes; and the introduction of an area based approach.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency based measures delivered through the Better Energy Warmer Homes programme.  Exchequer funding of over &#8364;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000 and has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach. The Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  Better Energy Warmer Homes has been allocated &#8364;20 million for this purpose.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are also a number of avenues open to consumers to try to mitigate rising electricity prices and measures are also in place to assist them.  Accordingly, consumers can, and should, shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers, and switch supplier if necessary, bearing in mind that all suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity usage which delivers demonstrable savings, including availing of Government funded measures as already referred to above.  The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Petroleum and Gas Exploration","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE01450"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[4598\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100051#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans for the implementation of recommendations in the Report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration here in relation to the licensing and tax terms for oil and gas exploration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>As I indicated previously I welcome the publication by the former Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture of its report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration.

The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  <\/p><p>  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.

The EEZ represents a compromise reached in the long negotiations on the 1982 Convention between those states that wished to extend their territorial seas out to 200 miles and those that wished to maintain the freedoms of the high seas that then applied in these waters.  Although no state is obliged to claim an EEZ, agreement on the EEZ regime allowed coastal states to extend their 12 mile exclusive fisheries zones out to 200 miles.  Within the EEZ they also have rights and duties in relation to the protection of the marine environment, production of energy from water and wind, and the conduct of marine scientific research should they seek to exercise them.

The Act sets out how the tax is to be administered, how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes and provides for the making of a Revenue Estimate.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are compiling a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State that will be used to correspond with all property owners.  Based on Census 2011 data, produced by the Central Statistics Office, there are an estimated 1.99 million residential dwellings in the State.  Revenue is currently refining the LPT Register to identify those properties owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies and will liaise directly with these organisations in respect of LPT arising on these properties.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that some individuals and companies will receive their LPT return electronically via the Revenue Online Service (ROS).  Accordingly, the number of paper returns expected to issue to owners of residential properties will be confirmed over the coming weeks, but is expected to be of the order of 1.6 million.  This general issue of paper LPT returns to property owners will commence in March 2013.  <\/p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.   I would like to clarify that the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved, as a matter of routine, in valuing properties. However, I am advised that they are actively preparing valuation guidance which, taken together with a liable person&rsquo;s own knowledge of their property, will assist them in assessing its value and that these will be made available as soon as possible. The guidance will include drawing property owners&rsquo; attention to the publicly available PSRA property price register which includes some 62,000 of reasonably recent property prices, and a method to help property owners establish average\/indicative values for properties in different locations. As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.  <\/p><p>  As part of the general issue of LPT returns by Revenue, property owners will also receive an information booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of each owner&rsquo;s individual property nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that they should pay.  Once the property owner meets their obligations by valuing their property, submitting their return and advising Revenue of their payment method within the relevant time limits, the Revenue Estimate of LPT notified to them is no longer relevant. On the other hand, where a property owner does not submit an LPT return by the due date, the LPT legislation provides that Revenue can enforce collection of the Revenue Estimate.  If a property owner pays the Revenue Estimate instead of submitting their LPT return they will not be immune from further action.  The property owner is still required to submit a self-assessed LPT return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[4859\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of organisations or agencies under the aegis of his Department that have vacancies on their board; the length of time any such vacancies have been unfilled; the number of vacancies that have been advertised; the number of applications to fill such vacancies that have been received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>The following table is the response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Name of Body <\/th><th>No of vacancies and date vacancy arose<\/th><th>No of advertised vacancies <\/th><th>No of applications received <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Central Bank Commission<\/td><td>1 vacancy (31st Dec 2011) <\/td><td>Expressions of interest sought<\/td><td>Approximately 19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Treasury Management Agemcy Advisory Committee<\/td><td>Three vacancies<br \/>1 from 01 May 2012<br \/>2 from 01 Jan 2012<\/td><td>Expressions of interest were sought for these vacancies<\/td><td>One expression of interest received<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission<\/td><td>One vacancy from <br \/>18 January 2013<\/td><td>The vacancy has not yet been advertised<\/td><td><div>-<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Development Finance Agency Board <\/td><td>Three vacancies<br \/>01 January 2013<\/td><td>Expressions of interest were sought for these vacancies<\/td><td>Five expressions of interest have been received<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Claims Agency Policy Committee<\/td><td>One vacancy from <br \/>01 January 2013<\/td><td>Position held by representative from Department of Health, which has been the practice since the committee was established<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Rebate Scheme","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[4871\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider an excise rebate on diesel for passenger transport companies; if he will confirm that this may be required under EU law in view of the fact that it is proposed to introduce an excise rebate in diesel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>The proposal to introduce an auto-diesel excise duty relief for licensed road hauliers that I announced in the Budget is confined to licensed and tax compliant hauliers.

Such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry. <\/p><p>  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003\/96\/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles.  I will be informing the European Commission of the rebate measure once it is introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[4879\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of public servants earning &euro;100,000 per year or more; the number of private sector workers earning &euro;100,00 or more; and the total tax take for this range of persons.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":172,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant sector-based information available on income earners in the tax system is derived from income tax returns filed for the income tax year 2010 and represents about 95 per cent of all returns expected at the time the data was compiled for analytical purposes.

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this. I confirmed in my Budget 2013 Speech that the levy will not be renewed after 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&#8217;s <i>Jobs Initiative <\/i>introduced<i><\/i>in May 2011. The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>   include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.  The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government. The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>   are aimed at assisting in employment generation &#8211; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. I cannot intervene in this process in respect of the pension fund referred to in the details supplied with the question or other pension funds.  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme&#8217;s liabilities to that member.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two exceptions to the requirement to pay the levy provided for in the governing legislation (section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999).  The first exception provides that the levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension schemes in respect of employees whose employment is or was wholly exercised outside the State. In other words the levy does not apply to the extent that a pension scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State.  The second exception provides that the levy will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind-up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive. The purpose of the levy is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[4923\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100053#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will make provision to allow local authorities to classify the way estates are part of the forthcoming local property tax and if he will allow the classifications to be approved by the elected members on the recommendation of the City or County Manager; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is asking about the process by which residential estates are classified as &lsquo;unfinished estates&rsquo; for the purpose of exemption from the Local Property Tax.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.  The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.<\/p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.

The national arrangements put in place by the National Procurement Service are designed to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money.  In utilising the national contracts, schools are able to take advantage of the NPS&rsquo;s buying power and as a result can purchase supplies at competitive prices.  This facilitates ongoing service delivery within tighter operating budgets.<\/p><p>  In relation to the potential impact of aggregated procurement arrangements, it is worth noting that such arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money and also facilitates SME access.  While certain categories of goods and services may be suited to single supplier arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm.  The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services- can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself.  Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  In 2012 the NPS, working with InterTradeIreland, for the first time brought together a number of the lead Government agencies to create a programme of major events for the Island of Ireland. Attendees could avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.

The original 1993 Working Time Directive (93\/104\/EC), which was transposed into national law by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, applied to all sectors of activity, both public and private, within the meaning of Article 2 of the Framework Health and Safety Directive 89\/391\/EEC.  Article 2.2 of that Directive provided for exceptions in respect of certain public service activities, such as the armed forces or the police, and certain activities in the civil protection services.  Therefore, when transposing the Directive, both the Defence Forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were excluded from the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  In addition, Regulations exempting the Civil Protection Services from certain provisions of the 1997 Act were also promulgated, i.e. the Organisation of Working Time (Exemption of Civil Protection Services) Regulations 1998 - S.I. No. 52 of 1998.  However, subsequent Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) rulings have indicated that the normal activities of the armed forces, emergency services or civil protection forces are covered by the Working Time Directive.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have not received any formal request to extend the provisions of the Act to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or to the Defence Forces from my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence.  However, in the context of the revised rosters in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which are currently being piloted, the Department of Justice and Equality has been in consultation with my Department on the question of the application of the Organisation of Working Time Act to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I understand that this work is ongoing in that Department.  The Minister has also advised me that a working group comprising representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are currently examining the application of the Organisation of Working Time Act to the Defence Forces.<\/p><p><br \/>  The 1993 Working Time Directive had excluded the activities of doctors in training and most transport sectors such as air transport, rail transport, road transport, sea transport, inland waterway and lake transport as well as sea fishing and other work at sea.  However, the 2000 Working Time Directive (2000\/34\/EC) amended the 1993 Working Time Directive to cover most workers in the sectors which had been excluded from that earlier Directive.  Provisions to extend the scope of the Working Time Directive to many of the previously-excluded sectors were then transposed into national legislation under various Statutory Instruments.  These Regulations included the Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Transport Activities) Regulations 2004 &#8211; S.I. No. 817 of 2004, the Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Offshore Work) Regulations 2004 &#8211; S.I. No. 819 of 2004, the European Communities (Workers on Board Sea-going Fishing Vessels)(Organisation of Working Time) Regulations 2003 &#8211; S.I. No. 709 of 2003.  In addition, Regulations transposing the provisions on Doctors-in-Training were promulgated by the Minister for Health as set out below.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to doctors in training, the 2000 Working Time Directive (2000\/34\/EC) provided for a derogation which would phase-in the maximum 48-hour average working week over a transitional period of five years from 1 August 2004.  This provision was transposed into Irish legislation by Regulations promulgated by the Minister for Health by way of Statutory Instrument No. 494 of 2004 - the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004 (as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 553 of 2010).  These Regulations implemented a phased reduction from an average of 58 weekly working hours to an average of 48 hours (as provided for under the Working Time Directive) from 1 August 2009 onwards.  The amending S.I. 553 of 2010 in relation to Doctors in Training provided for derogations from the rest breaks and daily and weekly rest provisions, where equivalent periods of compensatory rest are provided.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the Transport sector, the provisions of the amending 2000 Directive were transposed into Irish law by my Department by way of S.I. No. 817 of 2004 &#8211; the Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Transport Activities) Regulations 2004.  These Regulations transposed the 2000 Directive in relation to transport workers, with some exceptions, namely those workers performing mobile road transport activities as provided for in Directive 2002\/15\/EC (i.e. workers subject to tachograph rules), and mobile staff in civil aviation as defined in the Annex to Council Directive 2000\/79\/EC of 27 November 2000.  The effect of the transposition of those provisions of Directive 2000\/34\/EC relating to the transport sector was to apply the maximum average working week of 48 hours to mobile and non-mobile transport workers covered by that Directive.  S.I. No. 817 of 2004 revoked the earlier 1998 Regulations (i.e. the Organisation of Working Time (Exemption of Transport Activities) Regulations, 1998 &#8211; S.I. No. 20 of 1998<b>) <\/b>  which had exempted the transport sector from the rest provisions and weekly working hours provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  However, the exemptions in relation to the rest provisions continued to apply in S.I. No. 817 of 2004, subject to compensatory rest.<\/p><p><br \/>  A number of other Community instruments set out more specific working time requirements for particular sectors or occupational activities, and these take precedence over the provisions of 2003 Working Time Directive (2003\/88\/EC) which consolidated and repealed the earlier Working Time Directives.  These Community instruments are, in the main, in the transport sector, and my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has given these effect in national law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100056#WRK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":221,"content":"<p>Question No. 93 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100056#WRK00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100056#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[4840\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100056#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person who has been made redundant, but has not yet received the redundancy payment, may accept a new job offer with a different employer and still receive the redundancy payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>Where an eligible employee is made redundant his\/her eligibility for a statutory redundancy payment is not affected by accepting a job offer with a different employer.

The Department has a number of ICT systems which have been developed over many years to enable it to pay multiple groups of clients and manage data in relation to its various schemes.<font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>These systems reliably deliver over 87 million payments yearly between them. Although developed independently, mechanisms exist on its major systems whereby significant changes made to customer or claim details are automatically notified to other relevant systems.  The Department is working towards consolidation on a single ICT &#8216;platform&#8217; - the Business Object Model implementation - BOMi.  This work is carried out as part of the Department&#8217;s continuous Service Delivery Modernisation programme.  As this programme progresses, all of the Department&#8217;s client and claim-related systems will be integrated on the BOMi platform, ensuring that all client and claim information is fully and automatically available across all of the Department&#8217;s schemes and places of business.<\/p><p><br \/>  Not only does the Department work with the information held by ourselves, we also recognise the value of working closely and collaboratively with other agencies to ensure that social welfare abuse is comprehensively deterred and detected.  Over the last number of years, the Department has engaged in a range of data matching exercises with other Government Departments and public bodies for control purposes.  Data matching is viewed as an efficient and effective mechanism to target control-related activity and the Department is satisfied that it is an effective control tool. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Public Services Card (PSC) was launched last year following a pilot process and its roll-out is well underway.  To date, some 110,000 cards have been issued.  From the Department&#8217;s perspective, as well as combating identity fraud, the PSC will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel Card, with a highly secure card.  The robust face-to-face registration process, leading to issue of a PSC incorporating both the person&#8217;s photograph and signature, gives significant assurance as to the identity of the cardholder.  It will reduce the number of people who fraudulently claim to be someone else and will considerably reduce the potential for forgery.<\/p><p><br \/>  For the information of the Deputy, biometric information is information about human body characteristics, such as fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements and it is typically used for authentication purposes.  The PSC will store photographs and signatures.  It could store biometric information although there are no plans to do so at present.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Department has recently introduced electronic signing in local offices, replacing the existing paper-based system.  The new system is designed to improve both the customer experience and the efficiency of the certification process. It is currently in the process of being implemented across the regional network and is now in operation in 33 local offices.

To support the delivery of these essential services, the ring-fencing and prioritisation of places for child care was introduced on Community Employment in 2002. Total CE expenditure on child care amounted to &euro;22.4m in 2012.<\/p><p>  In order to support the delivery of community child care services there are 2,200 places designated for child care on CE each year; these places support community and voluntary providers of child care.  While the supply of child care places remains constant there has been a reduction in the overall take-up of places.  In 2005 there were 2,045 child care places taken up on CE and in December 2012 this had reduced to 1,696 child care places. Every effort is being made by the Department of Social Protection to encourage take-up of these places.  The Department in collaboration with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) are changing and improving the provision of training and work experience for CE participants who wish to pursue a career in child care.  These changes will provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community child care and provide training to the participant up to FETAC Level 5.  This new Training and Development Programme in Childcare will commence this year.<\/p><p>  Presently there are 288 schemes with ring-fenced places for child care. There are approximately 27 schemes that provide child care services only, fourteen of these schemes are located in Dublin.  The majority of schemes providing ring-fenced places for child care are not solely providing a child care service, these schemes co-ordinate a variety of places within communities. In most instances child care places are allocated to child care centres which are not directly managed by a CE Sponsor.<\/p><p>  In addition Budget 2013 provided an additional 2,000 places to CE, the increase in the number of places will be funded from the budget of the Department of Social Protection.  These places will be approved on a phased basis from the end of January to the end of the year, in line with the overall CE budget allocation to Divisions.  Priority will be given to schemes and organisations who are involved in the delivery of community child care services as well as social and health care services.  This is in order to support the provision of these services and offer training qualification and work experience to CE participants.  An allocation of 500 additional places will be reserved for child care support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100057#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100057#WRL01550"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[5029\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100057#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if and when rent support will be offered in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>As stated in the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous Parliamentary Question regarding this case, my Department requires the person concerned to provide acceptable proof of having been previously living in rented accommodation for at least 183 days prior to her current claim for Rent Supplement.

Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National and the Rural Broadband Schemes undertaken to date has resulted in Ireland meeting the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the positive developments, there remains an unacceptable digital divide between rural and urban areas.  A key commitment in the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, is to decisively tackle this divide.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across all regions.   <\/p><p>  The commercial sector is already investing in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  Undoubtedly, because of Ireland&rsquo;s low population density, particularly in rural areas, and the capabilities of different technologies, it will not always be possible for all parts of the country to experience the same speeds.  The key, however, is to ensure that citizens and businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment of 30Mbps availability to all will deliver this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100058#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":291,"content":"<p>Question No. 117 answered with Question No. 12.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100058#WRM01188"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[4855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100058#WRM01225","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of organisations or agencies under the aegis of his Department that have vacancies on their board; the length of time any such vacancies have been unfilled; the number of vacancies that have been advertised; the number of applications to fill such vacancies that have been received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>In the case of public bodies established by Statute, the maximum, and sometimes minimum, number of persons that may be appointed to the Board is generally set out in the relevant legislation.

The target is set at 16% of all energy consumed to be from renewable sources, with a minimum of 10% in the transport sector.  Ireland has set out that we intend to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating by 2020, which together amounts to 16% of all energy consumed.  At the end of 2012, 6.4% of all energy consumed was from renewable sources, hence a significant increase is required in the 8 years remaining.<\/p><p>  Wave and tidal energy has the potential to contribute to our renewable electricity target by 2020, provided the technologies become commercially viable in the period to 2020.  Our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) includes 75MW of ocean energy contributing to our 2020 target out of an estimated total of 4000MW required to deliver 40% renewable electricity.  This is based on the assumption that by 2020 some early pre-commercial wave and tidal devices will be connected and exporting power to the electricity grid.<\/p><p>  A range of supports have been deployed since 2009 in support of wave and tidal development.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has been taking forward the development of the sector through administration of a Prototype Development Fund of grants for industry.

This target has to be meet across the electricity, transport and heating sectors and a minimum of 10% in the transport sector is required.  Ireland intends to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which amounts to 16% of overall energy consumption, commensurate with our target.<\/p><p>  In terms of 40% renewable electricity to be achieved by 2020, the technologies through which this will be delivered has been largely determined by the grid connection offers to renewable generators.  The grid connection process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). CER published a Gate 3 direction in December 2008, which was specifically designed with the intention of providing for sufficient renewable energy grid connection offers to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.  The Gate 3 grid connection direction includes a list of specific renewable generating projects to receive grid connections and the type of renewable plant which each generator applied to build. The bulk of these are wind developments, which will play a key role in the delivery of our 2020 target.<\/p><p>  In addition, the CER published a decision on the connection of small, low carbon renewable generators outside the Gate process (CER 09\/99.)  This mechanism specifically provides for the ability of small anaerobic digesters, biomass CHP plants, wave and tidal devices and other non-wind renewable low carbon generators to connect to the grid outside of the Gate process by 2020.<\/p><p>  Given that at the time Gate 3 was designed, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) anticipated that 5,800MW of renewable generation would be required and that the latest modelling from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) shows that approximately 4,000MW will now be required to meet 40% renewable electricity, it is considered that there is sufficient generation in the existing Gates, even if some projects ultimately don&rsquo;t proceed to build.<\/p><p>  In order to deliver on our 2020 targets, EirGrid and ESB Networks need to deliver on the implementation of the Grid 25 Plans.  A large amount of grid upgrades and new grid build is required, in order for the projects in the existing Gate to be built out.  Figures from the System Operators indicate that over 13,000MW of renewable generators have applied for grid connection offers additional to Gate 3.  The take up of Gate 3 is not yet known, pending decisions by the SEM Committee on Scheduling and Dispatch and the issuance of updated constraint reports by EirGrid.  The decision about any future Gate will have to be considered in the context of the take up of Gate 3, the delivery of our 2020 targets and the upgrading and development of the Grid and operational changes required to ensure 40% renewable electricity by 2020.<\/p><p>  At end 2012, the generation figures for renewable electricity in Ireland were 2005 MW, broken down as follows:<\/p><p> - 1697 MW wind generation<\/p><p> - 216 MW large scale hydro<\/p><p> - 21 MW of small-scale hydro<\/p><p> - 71 MW of smaller renewable sources (CHP, solar and other bio-energy etc.).<\/p><p>  Over 17% of our electricity consumption in 2012 was from renewable sources.  While we still need to more than double that figure in the next 8 years, progress in recent years has been positive.  The modelling carried out by SEAI for the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) indicates the following breakdown of technologies contributing to our 40% renewable electricity target: 3521MW of wind, 274MW of biomass technologies by 2020, 234MW of hydro and 75MW of wave and tidal technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN00850"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[5019\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of exploration licences issued in each of the last five years to date; the numbers that have returned or position or commercially viable results; the likelihood for such in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[5022\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which positive or commercially viable explorations have identified oil, gas or other minerals or ores on or offshore in each of the past three years to date; the extent to which further development is expected in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>I propose to take Question Nos. 123 and 126 together.<\/p><p>The number of Mineral Prospecting Licences and Petroleum Exploration Licences granted in each year between 1 January 2009 and to date in 2013 is set out in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><div>Licences Granted during period 2009 &#8211; 2013<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Year<\/div><\/td><td><div>Prospecting Licences (Minerals)<\/div><\/td><td><div>Petroleum Exploration Licences <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>66<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>93<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011 <\/div><\/td><td><div>98<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><td><div>102<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2013<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Total<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>While there have been no new commercial discoveries of oil or gas in the Irish onshore or offshore in the past five years the drilling of an appraisal well on the Barryroe prospect in the Celtic Sea has shown encouraging results.

It is a fundamental principle of the regulatory framework for postal services and is an explicit requirement of the EU Postal Services Directive which has provided for the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act of 2011 also makes provision for a compensation mechanism, to be met by the postal industry, if it is found that the universal service obligation is an unfair burden on the designated universal service provider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN01550"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[5024\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if in line with other European countries, Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunication services including broadband and mobile telephony are updated and upgraded in terms of quality and extent throughout the country with particular reference to the need of the industrial and domestic sectors now and in the future in view of the existence of competition in the context of national recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[5025\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the most effective method of extending and upgrading broadband facilities with maximum benefit to the consumer and best value for money and the utilisation of wire, wireless, fibre optics or other systems including satellite; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 129 together.<\/p><p>  Broadband connectivity, as an enabling infrastructure for economic and social development, is a critical element of future sustainable economic growth and a priority for Government.  In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.<\/p><p>  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage and speeds of national broadband infrastructure, with a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.<\/p><p>  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30 August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  This is a challenge which faces all Member States who in turn experience different barriers to deployment.  The National Broadband Plan commits to ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  Ireland is now moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.<\/p><p>  As a consequence of the recent multi-band spectrum auction conducted by ComReg, new high speed 4G telecoms services will be rolled out by mobile operators and will significantly increase the speeds available across wireless platforms.  In addition, the commercial sector is already making investments in high speed fixed line services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  This exercise will identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years and will therefore inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aids application in respect of any State-led intervention.  A range of technologies are possible in order to deliver the speeds set out in the National Broadband Plan and the technologies used may vary according to circumstances.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in the digital environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100059#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[5026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the current rating of quality speed and standard of broadband here when compared with other EU jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>The most recently published statistical report published by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), for the period July-September 2012, reports that 75% of broadband customers in Ireland have contracted for marketed broadband services in a range between 2-10 Mbps and a further 21% have contracted at speeds exceeding 10 Mbps.

The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services.

The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country. <\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.

The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO00550"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[5028\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the degree to which the use and production of biodiesel, bioethanol or other energy continues to develop in accordance with targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive set a binding target on all Member States to achieve at least 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.

It sets out a system of national processes and standards for fire service delivery in Ireland based on a risk management approach to fire safety.  The national standards that are proposed in KCS are in keeping with international good practice and are crucial to a consistent approach across fire services in Ireland.  The standards in question are based on an &#8216;area risk categorisation&#8217; system which will be applied across the country by all fire services.  This will result in fire station areas being risk graded across five bands from very high to very low.  The fire service response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area is then related to this risk categorisation.  Pre-determined attendances (PDAs) indicate the number of appliances that will be mobilised initially in response to calls for assistance to particular categories of incident.<\/p><p><br \/>  Fires in dwellings (other than chimney fires) are categorised as primary fires and two fire engines will be the normal initial response to primary fires (pre-determined attendance).  This may be varied by the incident commander in light of available information.  The first appliance mobilised to an incident would have a normal crew complement of 5 personnel, to include a designated Incident Commander, with 4 personnel on the second or subsequent appliances mobilised from the same station.  I understand that a small number of stations within Dublin currently respond to an incident with 6 personnel in the first appliance . Therefore, the 20% reduction mentioned in the Question s refers to the impact of the proposal on a limited number of stations within Dublin Fire Brigade.<\/p><p><br \/>  In accordance with KCS, the primary responsibility will be on local service management to conduct a risk categorisation process for its functional area.  However, there is specific provision in KCS that in situations where fire services consider it appropriate to put in place arrangements different to the norms set out above such proposals and the supporting case may be included in the fire service&#8217;s discussions with an External Validation Group. This will ensure, as far as possible, that appropriate risk categorisation is applied and any vulnerabilities are addressed.  The draft KCS document is available on my Department&#8217;s web site at , and I intend to publish it as national policy in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO01950"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[4933\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100060#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the housing options available to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need.

The programme was introduced in January 2010.  Approximately 53,000 children, or 83% of the eligible age cohort, availed of the programme in this first &quot;short&quot; year.  In the school year 2010-2011, the first full year of the programme, in the region of 63,000 children, that is approximately 94% of the eligible cohort, availed of the free pre-school provision.  In the school year 2011-2012 in the region of 66,000 children, or approximately 93% of the eligible cohort, availed of the programme.<\/p><p>  In the current school year 2012-2013, some 66,000 children have enrolled for the free pre-school provision at this time and this figure may increase as eligible children can still enter the programme.  It is not possible, from the information available to me, to determine the percentage of the eligible cohort that this figure represents, but it is again anticipated this figure will be well in excess of 90%.<\/p><p>  Pobal, which administers the childcare support programmes on behalf of my Department, compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector.  According to its 2011 Annual Survey, there are in the region of 4,300 childcare services participating in the ECCE programme and approximately 3,133 of these services responded to the question relating to the number of staff employed.  The results, which did not distinguish between those working with children enrolled for the ECCE programme and other children in the childcare service, show that some 17,123 staff in the 3,133 services that responded were working directly with children.<\/p><p>  Prior to 2011, the Pobal survey was compiled on the basis of responses from services funded under the National Childcare Investment Programme and the Community Childcare Subvention Programme, and was part of the contractual requirement of its recipients.  In 2011, however, the questionnaire was circulated to a wider group of early years services to include all services participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and in the Childcare Education and Training Support Programme.  In addition, the questionnaire was presented to recipients as a piece of research rather than a contractual requirement.  This change in methodology (the distribution to much larger numbers, the move to anonymous completion and the removal of the contractual obligation to complete the questionnaire) means that the results are not comparable with previous years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100065#WRT02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Services","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[5050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason it has taking the Health Service Executive three years to provide information held by the Regional Adoption Services to the birth mothers of children that were adopted in the 1980s; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[5051\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reasons for the delay in providing documentation in relation to the adoption of their child to a person (details supplied) in County Galway by the Health Service Executive Regional Adoption Services in Glanmire, County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.<\/p><p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy with the most up-to-date information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU00450"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[4854\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the number of organisations or agencies under the aegis of her Department that have vacancies on their board; the length of time any such vacancies have been unfilled; the number of vacancies that have been advertised; the number of applications to fill such vacancies that have been received; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>I would like to inform the Deputy there are four agencies which are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote.

Following consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and liaison with other Departments, I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.

The health impact assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Ambulance Service","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01250"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[4831\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of landings there has been at each of the various hospital landing pads in the country over the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospice Services","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01450"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[4833\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funding allocated to St. Francis Hospice, Raheny, Dublin, in the National Service Plan 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Entitlements","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01650"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[4839\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100066#WRU01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding free general practitioner care for sufferers of long term illness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.

In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducts a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine.

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including: the implementation of new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades, and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.  The Health Service Executive's Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013.  This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance.  A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.  S.I. No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive for doctors in training, provides for:<\/p><p>  - A maximum 48 hour average working week;<\/p><p>  - A 30 minute rest break every 6 hours during period on-site on-call<\/p><p>  - 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and<\/p><p>  - 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.<\/p><p>  The 2010 Contract of Employment for NCHDs, which these staff sign on appointment, reflects the above provisions.  The contract also provides that NCHDs shall not be required to work more than 24 consecutive hours on-site.  A related agreement between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that the contract is subject to the requirements of the Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100067#WRV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":558,"content":"<p>Question No. 209 answered with Question No. 206.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Products","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100068#WRW00050"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[4942\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100068#WRW00100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of new GMS codes granted for medical products in 2012; the number of new applicant companies granted such codes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for granting GMS codes.

They informed me of their intention to increase premiums by 8%.  I told them in the strongest possible terms that this was not acceptable to me.  They have since announced that the premium increase will now be 6%.  I remain very concerned about the cost of health insurance.  The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible.  It remains committed to protecting community rating, whereby everyone pays the same price for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age or health status. <\/p><p>  I have repeatedly raised the issue of costs with health insurers as a whole and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.<\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees. Specific areas which I have requested to be addressed include:<\/p><p>  - Audit  - of the volume of procedures;<\/p><p>  - Clinical audit &ndash; to determine the appropriateness of procedures being claimed for;<\/p><p>  - Procedure based payments &ndash; in particular with a view to their extension to the public health sector;<\/p><p>  - Benchmarking &ndash; to determine the underlying basis for the cost of specific procedures, with a view to driving costs downwards.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 gave effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013.  This will contribute to the protection of affordability for those who need it most.  It is important to note that the measures contained in the new Risk Equalisation Scheme are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market, rather it is intended to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young. <\/p><p>  Finally, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums.  I would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100069#WRX01275","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100069#WRX01288"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[5043\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013100069#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of applications for increases in charges under the fair care scheme notified to his Department; the basis for such increases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund Board was designated under Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 as the body authorised to enter into arrangements on the price for long-term residential care services with private and voluntary nursing homes that wish to be \"approved nursing homes\" for the purposes of the Scheme.

It should be noted that in total there are 29 agencies under my Department's remit with a total of 236 individuals currently serving on boards.  It is important to note that the boards of each body are appointed in different fashions, with some positions being <i>ex officio <\/i>positions, some worker directors or others directly appointed by me, or by Government or with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In almost all cases the legislation provides that a Minister may appoint up to a certain number of individuals.  There is rarely a requirement that all positions be filled, and as is outlined below, there are good reasons why not all positions may be filled.<\/p><p>My Department advertised new procedures\u00a0for appointment to boards\u00a0on Friday 8th April 2011 which provided for any interested party to express an interest in becoming a member of the board of any of the State agencies for which I have responsibility.\u00a0  All appointments from that date have followed these procedures.  I have received more than 400 expressions of interest since the new procedures were advertised and more than\u00a040 of these individuals have been appointed\u00a0to various Boards under the Department's aegis.  Given the importance of ensuring the right mix of skills and experience\u00a0on every board, appointments are not necessarily confined to those who have made an expression of interest.  On becoming Minister,\u00a0I was particularly concerned that on many of the boards appointed under the previous Government there were obvious skills and experience\u00a0gaps, and in my appointments to date, I\u00a0have sought to rectify this.<\/p><p>It should be noted that I have, from time to time, decided not to fill all existing vacancies.  This is the case\u00a0with a number of\u00a0smaller bodies under my Department's aegis, where the scale of the agency's operation would not justify a larger board.\u00a0  Similarly, in a number of cases where the legislation provides for a very large board\u00a0I have taken the decision not to fill a number of positions.  Therefore, where there is flexibility under the relevant Act, I have on occasion appointed less than the maximum\u00a0number of directors.  I have also made considerable efforts to select suitably skilled candidates even if this involved some\u00a0delay in making the appointment.  \u00a0I believe that when making appointments to positions that carry terms over a number of years, suitable care must be taken to ensure that appropriate individual are appointed.<\/p><p>A decision on the separation of Cork and Shannon airports, as envisaged under the State Airports Act 2004 was not made until 2012.\u00a0\u00a0As a consequence, when the terms of appointment of the directors of both boards expired on 31 December 2011, a decision was made then not to fill all vacancies on each board until a substantive decision was made on separation and on the future structure of the DAA.\u00a0<\/p><p>On 27th November 2012, the Government confirmed its earlier decision in principle to establish Shannon as an independent autonomous airport and to merge it with a restructured Shannon Development to form a new publicly owned commercial entity.\u00a0  In light of this decision vacancies on both the Cork and Shannon Airport Authority Boards will be filled during the course of 2013.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>State Board<\/th><th>Vacancy
