I am both honoured and very pleased to have been asked by the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, who has responsibility for business and employment, to chair the panel of adjudicators pursuant to the Construction Contracts Act 2013.  It is very significant legislation which will, I believe, bring about a number of important reforms and transform the dispute resolution landscape in the construction sector.<\/p> <p>  I understand that on such occasions as this it is customary to give some personal background information.  I was born in Iraq.  Following my initial studies at Baghdad University, I graduated with first class honours and was awarded a scholarship to study for an MSc and PhD in England.  I completed my MSc at Manchester University in 1962 and my PhD in London in 1964.  It was a requirement of my scholarship that I return to work for the government for four years.  When I returned to Iraq in 1964 I was appointed as a lecturer at Baghdad College of Technology.  Alongside my work at the university, I was selected by Iraq Reinsurance Company, which was reinsured by the Munich Reinsurance Company, to manage and develop a new construction insurance pool.  It was then that I was introduced to conditions of contract, insurance and construction disputes.<\/p><p>I left Iraq and came to Dublin in September 1969, following which I applied for and was granted Irish citizenship.  In 1969, I joined T. J. O&rsquo;Connor and Associates, consulting engineers in Dublin , during which time I also acted as special adviser to the Munich Reinsurance company dealing with major construction claims in the Arab world and through which I was appointed to my first arbitration in 1972, which related to the collapse of a dam in Libya.<\/p><p> Later in the 1970s, I was asked by the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, ACEI, to help draft the third edition of the Irish conditions of contract and, in particular, to use my knowledge in relation to insurance and contracts, which I did.  Having incorporated many new ideas into these general conditions, I was commissioned by the ACEI to write a book explaining what I did and why, which was published in 1984.  In 1986, I extended that publication to construction insurance for international contracts, which is now in its second edition, last published in 2003.  I have a copy of these books with me if anybody wishes to look them.  They are too expensive to buy but are available in Trinity College library.<\/p><p> In 1979, I passed the fellowship examination of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, CIArb, and was later part of the founding committee for its Irish branch.  In 1986, I was elected chairman of that branch.  In 1987, I was elected president of the ACEI and having chaired a number of committees for the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, FIDIC, I was requested to help in drafting its international conditions of contract.  The 1987 FIDIC conditions of contract for civil engineering work introduced, for the first time, alternative dispute resolution to the construction industry.  My work on those conditions resulted in the publication of my book on the FIDIC form in 1992, a copy of which is available if members wish to browse through it.<\/p><p> Alternative dispute resolution methods started then.  The book explains the principles of the conditions of FIDIC and practical aspects of their application.  The book is now in its third edition.  As alternative dispute resolution methods became a necessary part of virtually all conditions of contract, Engineers Ireland asked me to head a committee to draft a form of a conciliation procedure for the industry in Ireland, which was produced in 1995, following which I was asked to chair the dispute resolution panel of Engineers Ireland between then and 2009.  That committee trained conciliators and lay dispute adjudication boards.  A one year diploma course was then devised by Trinity College, Dublin and I was asked to become a visiting professor.  The course has since developed to include various forms of dispute resolution methods, including adjudication.  <\/p><p> I left T.J. O&rsquo;Connor and Associates in 1994 to form Bunni &amp;amp; Associates Limited, in order to concentrate on dispute resolution and dispute avoidance, a subject I refer to as \"disputology&rdquo;.  In 1999, I was elected Fellow of the Irish Academy of Engineering and in March 2000, I was elected member of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration, which is a gathering of 45 members of the foremost leaders worldwide in the field of dispute resolution.  In 2000, I was elected president of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, CIArb, worldwide, and in 2005, I was appointed chairman of the executive committee of the Dubai International Arbitration Centre in the United Arab Republic, a position I retained until 2012.<\/p><p> In summary, I have acted as arbitrator in more than 150 arbitrations, both domestically and internationally, as conciliator, mediator, member of dispute board or adjudication board involving parties from more than 50 jurisdictions.<\/p><p>I have received a number of awards for my work in innovation and structural design and in 1995 and again in 2004, I was awarded the premier institution prize by Engineers Ireland for a &quot;contribution of outstanding merit ... to the benefit of the members [of the institution].&quot;<br\/><br\/>I greatly relish the prospect of bringing my experience to bear on the new construction contracts adjudication service to the benefit of the industry in Ireland.  Senator Feargal Quinn introduced this insightful legislation some years ago.  It strives, <i>inter alia<\/i>,  to provide a quick, fair and low cost remedy to disputants and follows the example set in certain other jurisdictions around the world.  My commitment to the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, this committee and the construction industry stakeholders is that, in so far as my responsibilities and authority envisaged under this legislation permit, I will endeavour to ensure that a robust, responsive, high-quality and fit-for-purpose adjudication service will be delivered for Ireland, standing the testimony both of time and in the interests of the parties in dispute.

One of the questions we had in developing the Construction Contracts Bill, which became the Construction Contracts Act, was how we would handle dispute resolution and whether it should be by way of mediation, arbitration or adjudication.  Will Professor Bunni give us his experienced view of the difference between the various alternative dispute resolutions and why he accepts that adjudication is the one for which we have aimed in this case with a very short timespan in each dispute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#E00600","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>This is a very important question and a full answer to it would take a whole day but I will try my best to answer it in the short and crisp way the Senator would want.  Adjudication is supposed to be a fast and fair method.  In Ireland it would have specific meaning because of the Irish Constitution.  We would have to apply not only the normal fairness that we would understand from other methods of dispute resolution but also what is termed to be constitutional fairness or constitutional justice, which is quite different from the norm.<\/p> <p>  If we move on from adjudication to other dispute resolution methods, they take longer.  In my experience, conciliation or mediation take at least three months in construction disputes.  I am not talking about other disputes but about construction disputes.  If one enters arbitration in construction disputes, which is a much more thorough process, it would take between two to four years, although the longest my role in such a dispute has lasted was ten years, after which one of my co-arbitrators, a lord justice of appeal in England for the English industry, retired and we managed to get this last segment of fees after that long period of time.<\/p><p>In terms of speed, there is a difference between adjudication, conciliation, mediation and, finally, arbitration, which is the longest.  If one takes justice as a second option for comparison, then, of course, adjudication could lead to rough justice because of the short period of time we are talking about.  We are talking about 28 days, and hopefully the courts will not take another 28 days to enforce their decision.  In international work, the 28 days is really 84 days.  Still, we are really talking here about fairness and justice that could be sped up through the method of looking at the problem.  Of course, one ends up in mediation or conciliation, and that is a totally different process because one is now trying to bang the two heads together to get them to agree.  If they do not agree, then it might take three months.  One produces a recommendation, and if that recommendation is rejected, one ends up in arbitration, which is really the best way of reaching a fair and proper decision, but it takes four years.<\/p><p> There is another aspect to adjudication which is significant - namely, that in this country, as part of the common law system, we look at all these processes domestically in a way that requires the adversarial system.  That means the judge, the arbitrator or whatever it is sits there between two parties that are fighting each other.  In adjudication the situation is different because one is required to seek the truth one's self.  It is more than the adversarial system one gets in Ireland or in the Commonwealth system.  One then moves into the field of international arbitration.  There, the arbitrator is asked to investigate the truth himself.  That is quite a different role.  Adjudication is quite different in those areas.  Explaining what the Senator asked is a three-month project for Trinity College.  It is really the most important question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Nael Bunni","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Professor Bunni did very well in three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#F00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Is Senator Quinn satisfied?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#F00300","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#F00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Professor Bunni is very welcome.

I am not sure Professor Bunni can help me, but I would be interested to find out whether advertisements have been made for the panel of adjudicators and when those positions are expected to be filled.

Unfortunately, some of the questions he has asked are beyond my control.  The only way I could answer that would be to say we are now on the first step towards doing all these things very quickly.  It has taken some time, I agree, but it had to be done right.  This is the first step.  Many more steps need to be taken and I hope they can be taken in no longer than three to four months.  Certainly, the wheels are in motion.  One of them is exactly what the Deputy has said, namely, the panel itself.  Before the panel can be selected or appointed, there would have to be a process of seeking the right people for the job.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n noticed from my reply to Senator Quinn, specific qualifications are required for adjudicators.<\/p><p>For example, an arbitrator practising in a domestic scene would not automatically be good enough to act as an adjudicator, nor, indeed, would a conciliator, because the decision of an adjudicator has to have reasons, and those reasons, while they are similar to those made by an arbitrator, are not similar to those of a conciliator.<\/p><p> Certain elements in respect of qualifications have to be decided on and a code of conduct under section 9 of the act is required.  This has not, as far as I know, been completed, although many drafts seem to have been done, and I have seen at least one produced by Engineers Ireland some time ago.  There are a number of steps to be taken.  For example, the publication of various forms is necessary, as these have to be ready so that applications can be sought from people who think they are good enough to apply.  This has to be done very shortly but, unfortunately, I am not privy to the timeframe.  Somebody else will have to answer that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Nael Bunni","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in wishing Professor Bunni well in his role.

There is one aspect on which I have been commenting for many years - in fact, from the time the legislation was first thought about.  This is that there ought to be a court system or a particular judge designated for adjudication.  Various matters which have been questioned in the technical press, or by myself, could easily be ironed out by such a judge.  In Ireland we are blessed with a very high calibre of judge, and any of the judges working at the moment could handle this particular aspect of the legislation.  The first real-life case to go to enforcement will bring in at least one of these issues and, depending on how it is resolved, it has the capacity to make this piece of legislation a very successful one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Nael Bunni"},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Bunni and thank him for his views, which he has put very succinctly and clearly.

The institute was 100 years old this year and for its festivities it asked various people from around the world to submit papers on the very question the Deputy asked.  I was asked to give a copy of my paper for the journal in a light-hearted form.<\/p><p>These were published and I will make sure the committee receives a copy.  This will explain, in a way, that conflict in the world has started for the very simple reason that we have language.  It is a very difficult thing to master.  I could say the same words in two different manners and mean totally different things.  I could say \"I wish him to survive\" or \"I wish to survive him.\"  The sentences use exactly the same words, put in different places, and the meaning is totally different.  In answer to the question, our problem with language results in our problems with disputes.  We say things, hoping to be comprehensive, but it never works that way.  The problem of disputes exists everywhere in the world.  The problem of having to solve these disputes varies from one country, jurisdiction or legal system to another.  In Parliament, one has to concentrate on what system of law exists because, ultimately, to resolve a dispute involves a legal process.  It could be a non-legal process if the parties agreed to sit down and mediate or conciliate, but once one moves away from mediation, conciliation or simply discussing the matter, then it is a legal process.  That legal process fits into one of three systems of law in the world today, including the common law system, which Ireland, England, America and Australia use, or civil law, which deals with the issue quite differently and operates in Europe, some parts of the Middle East and some parts of Asia.  Countries with Islamic law deal with the issue completely differently.  The question needs to be isolated into three different parts, so one can then see how things work around the world. <\/p><p> Having done this, unfortunately, one still comes to the same methods for which Senator Quinn asked at the beginning of the meeting.  He asked how they compared.  I was part of the committee in the Institution of Civil Engineers in London when the British decided to introduce adjudication.  We had internal discussions and were invited to contribute.  The system developed in England was designed to move from arbitration to adjudication, despite the fact that conciliation had been born there.  It developed extremely well in the UK.  Europe never went that way and never touched on adjudication, and people think more in terms of arbitration as the final or long-term solution because, as I said in my answer to Senator Quinn, it is probably the most comprehensive and fair way of dealing with the problem.  It takes a long time and costs a lot more, but it is the best way.  That is where Europe has gone.<\/p><p> One finds under Islamic law that conciliation takes place.  In fact, it is written in the Koran, the holy book of Islam, that if one has a problem, one should try to conciliate, and it tells one how to do so.  It says that one person must be brought in from one side and one from the other, and that they must sit down and come to a solution.  It is a very wide subject, but I will make sure the committee receives a copy of my paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Nael Bunni","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Bunni for attending today to engage with the committee.

As the committee will be aware, the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, is organised on an all-island basis and reflects the support we receive from trade unions across the island of Ireland and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It seems to us that the area of research on the cross-Border or all-island dimension of both economies is a vital area that has perhaps been neglected in the last ten or 20 years.<\/p><p>Paradoxically, it may also be connected to the peace process because aspects of cross-Border co-operation became more normal and the saliency of addressing particular issues on an all-island basis became less evident.  At a professional level, it seems that cross-Border exchanges among economists and analysts is not what it could be.  There was more professional engagement at various levels 20 years ago.  I wished to make this point at the outset because it is also welcome that various bodies, including the Centre for Cross Border Studies, which has existed for many years and, more recently, the management school in Queen's University Belfast, have engaged more with this aspect of the all-island economy.  However, much remains to be done.  We are joined today by other research colleagues who have been working in this area for many years.<\/p><p> One of the benefits of focusing on the all-island economy is that it identifies how we fit into a global economy as a small, open, regional economy with significant exposure to international events and patterns of trade and investment.  However, the extent of exchange trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland is still limited, for example, in manufacturing goods and exports.  I am aware that the committee received a presentation from InterTradeIreland.  We estimate that the value of merchandise good exports from South to North does not exceed 2.1% of the total in recent years.  This percentage has decreased a little since 1996.  There has been a modest upward trend in cross-Border trade since 2009, but it is limited in terms of merchandise goods.  Unfortunately, we have less insight into trade in services.  Tourism has developed and grown, more so in the direction of North to South.  There are still barriers of one sort or another, established paths of dependence and habits of exchange and trade, that mean that there are untapped opportunities.<\/p><p> The energy market is more organised as an all-island reality, but there are still major opportunities.  I wish to mention the importance of investment in natural resources and renewable energy and the opportunity to develop further critical investment in these areas.  As an island and taking both economies together, we are exposed and vulnerable to international shocks in the price of energy and the supply of fossil fuel imports.  We need to reduce our dependence over time.  This calls for strategic investment in new forms of energy supply.  As a country and island, we have considerable resources in our oceans and wind compared with other parts of Europe.  These should be developed.<\/p><p> Regarding the possible value of oil and gas explorations off the coast, the collapse in crude oil prices represents a problem.  None the less, a suggestion that is worth exploring further in the long term is that we should re-examine the terms and conditions applied to oil and gas exploration.  It may be possible to channel some of the economic benefits and tax revenues, if there are commercial finds, into some kind of fund that could be organised on an all-island basis so as to invest in the areas that I mentioned.  This would require long-term, courageous, strategic thinking that took us beyond the limited scale, such as it is, of cross-Border co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.  I will begin by giving a brief overview of the two economies on the island and how they have each experienced the recession.  Both jurisdictions underwent a substantial economic downturn following the financial crash in 2008.  While the experience of property bubbles and bank failures is common to both, the scale of externally imposed austerity and outcomes in the labour market have been very different.  For instance, house prices in Northern Ireland increased substantially in the two years prior to the crash before reaching a peak in 2007.  By contrast, the increase in prices in this State followed more of a trend growth from the previous decade, which led to a situation in which we have proportionately more people in negative equity in the South, or in much deeper negative equity, compared with the situation in the North.  Northern Ireland's property prices are still 50% below where they were before the crash.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the labour market, while unemployment reached a peak of 13% in this State, it peaked at just above 8% in the North in early 2013.  In respect of the banking sector, financial institutions in Northern Ireland faced similar losses to those in the South, but the cost of this was borne either by the British or Irish Government, depending on where the institution was headquartered.<\/p> <p>  Northern Ireland has experienced a significant cut in Government expenditure since 2008 in line with the rest of the UK, but its experience has not been of the same scale as the rest of that country.  Austerity measures are estimated to have totalled some 18% of GDP in the North, compared with a UK figure of 9%.  The North saw the largest fall in incomes of any UK region over the course of the recession and is now the lowest-income region.  Incomes in the Republic also fell significantly, but the downward trend began much earlier, in 2008 and 2009, compared with 2010 and 2011 in the North and the rest of the UK.<\/p> <p>  In terms of barriers to the all-island economy and increased trade, the currency issue has become much more current given recent fluctuations.  As Dr. Healy mentioned, the trade in manufactured goods was roughly equal between both economies until 2001.  Trade from the Republic to Northern Ireland dropped off significantly after that, however, aided by a sharp depreciation in sterling in 2002.  Exchange rates then stabilised until a further significant devaluation of sterling arose in 2008 and 2009 following the financial crash.  The advent of the euro has meant that the exchange rates between both jurisdictions on the island are less sensitive to changing economic conditions in each jurisdiction.  While that has advantages, particularly for this State, in terms of increased trade to the rest of the European Union, it also has had an unintended consequence.  The most recent depreciation of the euro following quantitative easing by the European Central Bank highlights the remoteness of such decisions.<\/p> <p>  Areas close to the Border, on either side, have maintained some of the highest levels of unemployment and lowest levels of productivity in Ireland and the UK.  On the idea of introducing a development zone, I am concerned that the experience of such zones, referred to as enterprise zones, in the UK has not been convincing.  There is scant evidence that favourable tax treatments or increased capital allowances have made any inroads into encouraging economic development.  Perversely, where enterprise zones were considered to have been moderately successful in the UK, it was found that rather than creating increased economic development, they merely drew in economic development that would have transpired in surrounding regions.<\/p><p>Therefore there is a danger that focusing on supply side initiatives in one particular geographical region may ultimately create areas of economic underdevelopment in surrounding regions.  However, there are opportunities to harness cross-Border co-operation to enhance the Border region, particularly with regard to public services and in the important areas of education and skills, in order to remove a possibly false limit on economic growth.<\/p><p> With regard to a job creation strategy, NERI has been producing research on the need for a significant rethink of industrial policy in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  In particular, the current trajectory of policy would indicate that the Northern Ireland Executive intends to attempt to compete with the Republic of Ireland in terms of job creation and foreign direct investment.  I refer in particular to the current plans to devolve and reduce corporation tax powers in Northern Ireland, which would signal a dangerous shift away from all-island co-operation and could lead to a dangerous race to the bottom in terms of policy.  The Northern Ireland economy has suffered years of under-investment in both the public and private sectors and consequently, any claims that Northern Ireland could emulate the perceived success of the Republic of Ireland economy in the 1990s by simply reducing corporation tax is misleading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mac Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here and to be reunited with one or two old colleagues around the table whom I have worked with previously.  I am professor of enterprise at Warwick Business School in the UK.  At Warwick I lead the Enterprise Research Centre, or ERC, the UK&rsquo;s national centre for research on small and medium enterprises.  The ERC is a collaboration between five UK universities - Warwick, Aston, Imperial, Birmingham and Strathclyde - and is funded by the UK Government, the UK&rsquo;s major banks and one or two of our targeted agencies, including Innovate UK.  Therefore, we have a very strong strand around innovation and exporting.<\/p> <p>  My interest in the all-island economy is long-standing.  Before moving back to England in 2003 to take up a chair in Aston, I worked for nearly 20 years in Northern Ireland in economic research centres.  I worked with Dr. Tom Healy for a while and I have written extensively on the all-island economy and particularly on issues related to innovation and innovation promotion.  I also had the chance to spend time at the ESRI in 2003 working on some issues around the broader Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the committee&rsquo;s focus on trying to build stronger synergies across the all-island economy.  This all-island perspective on policy-making is long overdue, in my view, and it is a welcome development.  I also welcome the focus on trade, but I think that any focus on all-island trade - on cross-Border trade - is somewhat misplaced.  Instead, I wish to see the committee focusing much more broadly on emphasising exports from the island of Ireland rather than on exports within the island and on exploring mechanisms that can be put in place to strengthen businesses and collaboration between businesses to enable them to innovate and export from the island.  Therefore, I wish to make some remarks about the mechanisms that might be adopted for building co-operation between businesses to enable them to become more effective innovators and exporters.  In some ways, this reflects closely the original objectives outlined in the Bradley Best report, which seem to me to have been rather lost in more recent discussions about the cross-Border enterprise zone, the objectives of which have become very much less clear.<\/p> <p>  Recent research has emphasised three findings.  First, innovation and exporting are very closely related.  Small businesses that export grow more than twice as fast as those that do not, while internationally active SMEs are three times more likely to engage in innovation of products and services.  These two things go together.  Second, innovation is very much enhanced where firms work in partnership with each other or in partnership with external organisations.<\/p><p>That innovation then provides the basis for exporting.  Indeed, one study we recently published, based on data from the Republic and Northern Ireland, suggests that for small firms with fewer than 50 employees, approximately 40% of the value of their innovative activity derives from partnerships rather than from knowledge that is developed within the firm.  Those external links are hugely important for small firms in driving innovation.  For large firms it is approximately 25%, for smaller firms it is approximately 40%, so that is quite a big difference.  Of course, the Border zone, particularly in the central Border, is dominated by those types of smaller companies.<\/p><p> The third big picture research finding over the last few years is that productivity gains arise when innovation and exports come together.  In a sense what we want ideally is to encourage firms to be innovative and then to export the results of that innovation.  We have taken some useful steps already in promoting innovation across the island wide economy through things such as the innovation vouchers programme, a cross-Border initiative between Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI.  However, we can do more and there are three particular areas where we might consider more activity.<\/p><p> The first is brokerage.  This is the idea that small firms often find it very difficult to identify the partners that they might use for joint innovation and, potentially, joint export initiatives.  We could do more to broker partnerships between small businesses to generate those things.  In the UK we have been playing with policy initiatives such as growth vouchers and creative credits to try to form these innovative partnerships.<\/p><p> The second theme, and it follows from the first, is that we could prioritise support for collaborative innovation.  Typically, in the past we have supported, through Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI in the North, innovation by individual businesses, but increasingly we have learned that it is partnership or network based innovation which is really most important and provides perhaps a more successful basis for exports.  Prioritising that type of collaborative innovative activity might be more important.<\/p><p> Third, I believe supply chains offer an opportunity.  We have a number of supply chains which have a significant cross-Border dimension.  They offer the opportunity for the upgrading of SMEs, innovation along the supply chain and the potential for building a stronger innovation and export base both in the Border region and in the wider Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Roper","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I am very honoured by the committee's invitation to the meeting to discuss issues related to the all-Ireland economy.

During this work we spent time getting to know the cross-Border area, talking to stakeholders and visiting a series of entrepreneurial companies.  The lessons that we learned highlighted the weaknesses of strategic thinking in the area of regional development in both jurisdictions and the urgent need to join up thinking on regional development policy with enterprise development policy in areas of the island characterised by peripherality, rural demographics and the complication of the policy fault line between North and South.

This is the second session we have had with different stakeholders and academics giving their perspective on North-South enterprise.<\/p><p>In general, most individuals have given a view that there has been a diminution of emphasis on cross-Border development or partnership over the last number of years for a number of different reasons.  There has also been a lack of measurement of the engagement and of the relationship that exists, as mentioned with regard to services in the presentations by the witnesses.  That sits beside the fact that there is obviously a shocking level of poverty, economic disadvantage, unemployment and emigration both North and South within the Border region.  We also see that one of the major organisations, IntertradeIreland, has had a significant cut in funds, more so than any other enterprise organisation on the island of Ireland.  If one speaks to anybody, they will say that cross-Border partnership and an all-island economy are good things, and one will hear an awful lot of lip service with regard to the issue.  Before I move to questions to individuals, I want to ask a general question.  Is it the perspective of the witnesses that there is such lip service?  Is there institutional inertia on both sides of the Border with regard to actually taking those steps necessary to build on that all-Ireland economy which everybody says could bring enormous advantages to all citizens on the island?<\/p><p> Mr. Paul Mac Flynn talked about Border enterprise areas and, if one likes, simply taking enterprise from one area and putting it into another.  There is a current view that the Dublin section of the island is nearly overheating with regard to development, and even the NERI report in 2014 suggested that very few jobs had been created outside the Dublin region.  If that is the case, displacement of some level of that economic activity to the Border region could be a good thing, to a certain extent.<\/p><p> Professor Stephen Roper stated that synergies and partnerships were key to both innovation and exports.  Are there any examples of what could be done?  For example, IntertradeIreland plays a role in those types of synergy.  Given the infrastructure of both the Northern state and the Southern in terms of enterprise, what are the practical steps that could be taken to achieve that?  I like the idea of having a conversation about exports from the island rather than having a narrow focus on this.<\/p><p> Professor Roper said that supply chains have a cross-Border aspect.  Can he put some meat on the bones of what he means by supply chains and what is the reality of them?  With regard to brokerage in Ireland, how would Professor Roper suggest we develop more brokerage in the landscape of Ireland?<\/p><p> Dr. Bradley spoke about the dichotomy between the IDA and Enterprise Ireland that is referred to in the report.  Is he suggesting that there is a necessity to unify Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in the delivery of their functions?  All of the enterprise agencies on the island seem to be functioning in competition with each other, which seems incongruent, given the idea of partnership and innovation.  The witnesses might address those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#N00500","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>In terms of the general point about all-island matters falling off the agenda, I think it would join a long list of longer-term solutions to economic growth that have fallen off the agenda in recent years.

I absolutely agree that the focus on an all-island economy is a more long-term strategy for growth.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the enterprise zones, I suppose the Deputy pointed to one way of seeing it, but I think it is a fairly harsh way of trying to achieve regional balance by seeing it as a zero-sum game.<\/p><p>My point was not to say that particular regions should not be singled out for greater attention but that there is a tendency with the model of enterprise zones to focus on supply side measures which tend to encourage the shifting of activity rather than more demand side measures in parallel with infrastructure that tend to increase the total amount of economic activity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mac Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>What kind of demand side activity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#P00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>In terms of the Border region, perhaps State investment taking a greater and more strategic role.

Regional growth involves identifying where particular sectoral or industrial strengths lie within particular regions, and then deciding to make a long-term commitment in terms of focused capital spending or research grants towards a goal of growth in a particular sector.  There is a danger that we fall into the trap of thinking that all that is needed is the cutting of red tape and of tax allowances and then such activity will magically appear in the Border region.

There is the potential for greater collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland in terms of the targeting of State support for innovation and exporting.  That does not need to involve direct support in terms of grant support for businesses, but it could involve the provision of export market information and information about partner networks or partners which might enhance brokerage.  <\/p> <p>  As part of the innovation strategy preparations in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in the North, the potential for an open innovation centre in Northern Ireland was defined.  It involved a range of activities around trying to build the awareness of open innovation among businesses, that is, building demand and trying to build the capability within small companies to work together to deal with the innovation and exporting which might come from that.  That built on a range of other examples of best practice across Europe, where universities and cities have established intermediary organisations, like Fraunhofer in Germany, to develop that kind of connectivity between firms.  Not all firms will play, but a significant number may do so.<\/p> <p>  On the supply chain point, I had a couple of things in mind.  One is that there are quite a number of logistic networks which spread across the Border.  I was also thinking in terms of agrifood, where I guess there is quite a lot of cross-Border trade as part of those kinds of supply chains.  I am not an expert on that sector, but it strikes me that trading links are very often the basis for innovation collaboration.  It provides a good starting point because some trust has already been established between the businesses involved.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Roper"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I do not understand where the idea of unifying the IDA and Enterprise Ireland might have come from in my writing.  The problem with the cross-Border region is that it is a region of low population density with very few urban centres and foreign firms tend to locate around large cities, such as Limerick, Galway, Cork and Belfast.  Enterprise Ireland has the more difficult task of creating indigenous businesses in regions with a low population density.  When they were broken up some ten or 15 years ago, it was a very logical break-up.<\/p><p> I was asked about competition between the Southern and Northern agencies.  This is very natural as they are competitors and it is like asking two runners in a race to co-operate as to who will win.  One will always do one's best to win.  This, however, is where the tragedy of InterTrade Ireland comes in.  That could have been an embryonic cross-Border development synthesis.  It could have been to cross-Border industrialisation what, say, the European Coal and Steel Community was to the European Union in that it could have evolved similarly.  For political reasons, into which I will not go but with which I am sure members are only too familiar, this never happened and is not going to happen.  <\/p><p> As policy-makers sitting in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, members tend to look at the world form the perspective of a policy-maker.  Senator Quinn, who looks at the world from the point of view of enterprises, knows that the world looks very different from that perspective.  I am told that the recent initiatives by IBEC and the CBI in Northern Ireland are resulting in a massive increase in cross-Border interest on the part of firms.  This is taking place entirely within the private sector and is not being hindered by the policy dysfunctionality between North and South, although it is not being helped by it either.  What is needed is to encourage the private sectors, North and South, to take on the responsibility for evolving and co-operating and not to imagine that policy-makers are ignorant of what is going on, waiting for the private sector to push them in one direction or another.  Our experience and our research show that businessmen are very clever and know more about the business environment in which they work than policy-makers.  Policy-makers sometimes make policies that are inappropriate to the conditions of business and we found some glaring examples of this in our research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Bradley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Would Dr. Healy like to comment on the first question that was asked about institutional inertia?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#Q00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432643400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>This comes from a keen sense of urgency and the priorities at regional and sub-national levels.

One example of that, which is obviously a long-term issue, is harnessing wind and solar energy, particularly ocean-based sources of energy, and the possibilities of transferring and moving some of that energy source across the island, given the excess demand for electricity, in particular on the island of Great Britain.  We should also be mindful, as we talk about an all-island perspective, that there is also an all-islands perspective and all of this fits together naturally.  What Northern Ireland and the Republic have in common in particular is a very problematic dependency on fossil fuel imports, so any initiative, either at European level or commercially here, to rise to that challenge and shift the dependency on traditional sources of energy, is very welcome.

We have had a huge surge forward in terms of road transport in the Republic.  The M1 motorway, for example, has made a huge contribution to shortening the distance between Belfast and Dublin compared to 20 years ago.  However, it is notable that the carriages on the Enterprise express train between Dublin and Belfast date from the early 1990s, so when I travel on the train, as I do regularly, I cannot charge my phone.  There are no sockets as the train is from the pre-smartphone era.  Wi-Fi is also pretty unreliable.  Anyone who uses the transport between Belfast and Dublin, particularly in some areas which I will not name, can assume the coverage will go down.  From a business point of view, Wi-Fi is important in every area of the country, including areas of the west and north, from the perspective of tourism, services, and activity in all sectors.

However, it is also worth saying that Northern Ireland is the least connected of the UK regions to Europe in terms of trade.  The southern regions of England are much more strongly connected.  The implication, therefore, is that if the UK were to leave the EU, any potential downside which may arise is unlikely to have quite the impact on Northern Ireland that it would have perhaps on southern regions of England.  This is to take a downside view.  Of course one might argue that we could end up in a kind of Norwegian situation, in which case it is probable the benefits on the upside would also be less in the case of Northern Ireland.

If one measures imbalances between the Irish counties in terms of output per head or GDP per head, these disparities are much bigger than if one measures it in terms of household disposable income per head.  There is much more equality there because the social welfare transfer system transfers income from the rich regions to the poor regions.  However, that creates dependency, so although it is socially very desirable in the short run, we have examples in Europe such as the Mezzogiorno region in southern Italy, where this kind of dependency can last forever.  If I may say something that might be controversial in Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland is a very good example of this within the 13 regions of the UK, because it is the most dependent region and has been for decades, yet development has not been stimulated.  The point I was making was not that there should be some horrifying austerity process to deprive the poor regions of their income support; rather, it was to draw attention to the fact that this does not drive enterprise, entrepreneurship and production because it has to go with other measures.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by adding an anecdote.

I would like to introduce Mr. Stephen Curran, an official in the Department who deals with this area and with international investment.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee.  As members may know, I meet twice yearly, in the North-South Ministerial Council, with the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, who up to now was Ms Arlene Foster.  Mr. Jonathan Bell is taking over that role.  We jointly oversee the work of InterTradeIreland.<\/p><p> I know InterTradeIreland made a presentation to the committee.  InterTradeIreland is a remarkable body in terms of what it is doing.  I am sure it explained what it does  and that its ratio of added value to expenditure is very strong.  In its last three-year programme up to 2013, it set a target of a jobs impact of 500 but it reached 1,900.  It has set a job impact target  in its 2014 to 2016 programme of 3,500 and in the first year, it hit 1,900, which is past the half way mark.  InterTradeIreland runs innovative and targeted programmes which fit well within the portfolios of the bigger bodies, both North and South.  I am sure members know about Acumen, which is dealing with cross-Border business.  It also has a Go-2-Tender programme, which encourages companies to combine and bid for procurement contracts.  The programme Elevate seeks to support exporting.  It has a very interesting technology transfer programme, where it places graduates, North and South, in one another's companies and get the support of access to the third level college.  It has been innovative in the operation of its programmes.  Not only has it faced the general efficiency reduction in  terms of budgets in the past number of years, but more recently it has faced a cut because of the difficulties in putting together the budget in Northern Ireland.  We have been very keen to try to prevent it impacting on the work that is being done.  I think it will be able to maintain its programmes this year through reserves.  It has gained great acceptance, North and South.  The good work it does has been very fruitful in building mutual confidence among Ministers.  We have very good exchanges and I hope we can build on that.<\/p><p> The investment under the INTERREG programme is very significant.  The INTERREG programme did not just cover enterprise, for which I have responsibility but also transport, tourism and health.  It resulted in 28 projects coming forward.  Some of these innovative projects involved the local enterprise office structures and similar ones in Northern Ireland.  Together they have focused on initiatives to support micro-enterprises but also on the flagship projects of the science parks in Derry and Letterkenny and the enterprise centres in Omagh and Carrick-on-Shannon.  Those who visit these centres can only be impressed.  The new programme will shortly have its first call.  I know money for research and innovation has been set aside where people see an opportunity to build connections between the private sectors, North and South, through collaborative work.  That has been an important theme of much of the work.  InterTradeIreland is trying to develop collaboration in the research and innovation areas and this can go deeper and will foster collaboration at the level of enterprise.  I hope it will stimulate work in this area.  There are two streams of funding.  The smaller of the two is for SMEs to get involved in cross-Border research and innovation activity, which is very sensible, and the large block of money, &euro;52 million, will be aimed at the creation of centres of excellence, which would undertake research in two specific areas, health and life sciences and renewable energy.<\/p><p>It is very sensible that we move towards that.  We are a small island and we cannot be expert at everything.  Where we can have centres of excellence through combining resources, then that clearly is helpful. <\/p><p> The committee will know, from InterTradeIreland, about the success of the Horizon 2020 collaboration we have in place.  It has proven itself in that the jointly sponsored programmes have been more successful.  They have enjoyed a higher success rate in drawing down funds than stand-alone projects.  We also have the US-Ireland Research and Development Partnership, which is in its ninth year.<\/p><p> Members have mentioned issues related to a possible British exit from the European Union.  Clearly, such an exit would be a challenge in any consideration of the all-island economy, not least because of the contribution of European funding but also because, as two small trading economies that operate side by side, it is in both our interests to have barrier-free trade and investment.  Naturally, there is concern, North and South, about an exit.  We are keen to assist the process of negotiation that is emerging in order to try to get a satisfactory outcome that can be put to the British people in due course, as indicated by the new British Government.<\/p><p> In terms of North-South trade, there has been some significant improvement in recent times.  This year to date, we have had 12% growth in Irish trade to the North, which is an increase on the previous year's rate of 8% and that of 3% in the year before that.  We have seen some growth.  Both economies are seeing some recovery in employment.  In the North, there was 1.7% growth in employment last year and in the South, it was just over 2%.  There are some signs of vibrancy in the two economies, which bodes well for the future.  <\/p><p> The committee has considered wider development zones and so on.  We are watching that debate.  One of the things that we are doing, as the committee will know, is looking at weaker regions and analysing how to maximise the performance of our regions.  We have committed to enhanced activity, with &euro;150 million in the IDA property-based area.  We also have committed to these calls within the regions.  We are open to innovative calls coming forward from community-based groups, local enterprise offices and others which would be collaborative.  We are consciously providing loadings in favour of innovative collaboration.  There is a potential in these calls to see initiatives come forward that would tap into the potential of the cross-Border region.  <\/p><p> I will leave my comments at that and will take questions or deal with issues members would like to put.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#Z00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.

Views may differ but they are part of a constructive discussion to improve the project and feed into the committee's report.  We have had a great opportunity to discuss this matter with a large number of academics and trade union activists, etc.  They have fed information to the committee on all-island trade.  The Minister might give his perspective on some of the issues they raised.  One of the issues raised today was that the Border region has suffered from peripherality, rural demographics, location and from being a policy fault line.  Peripherality and rural demographics are not for us to fix.  However, the policy fault line and how it functions were identified as problems.  It was stated that they have led in the direction of dependency, both North and South.<\/p> <p>  Another problem mentioned was that with the problem of the recent troubles having largely been resolved, there was not the same level of urgency around cross-Border affairs.  That was a perspective expressed by an academic and I would like to hear the Minister's view on same.<\/p><p>The view was that there was more engagement with these issues 20 years ago than today.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned the statistics for trade North and South.  A statistic we received today was that, when compared with the total value of merchandise exports from the Republic of Ireland, manufactured goods exports dropped from 2.1% to 1.4% between 1996 and 2014, although there has been a modest trend upwards since 2009.  Therefore there has been a fall overall in terms of trade from the South to the North.  It was also mentioned that there was a lack of data on cross-Border service trade.  In that significant sector of service, we did not have the measurement tools to work that out.  The tragedy of industry in Ireland was discussed earlier by Dr. Tom Healy, as well the policy dysfunction North and South.  It was stated that recent initiatives by IBEC and CBI had resulted in a massive increase in interest on the part of cross-Border firms, almost despite policy development.  We heard some very simple things.  For example, we heard from one academic that the Dublin to Belfast train does not arrive in Belfast until 9.45 a.m.  Although this is not specifically in the remit of the Minister, a tourism body was created that did not have a genuine strategic synergy.  The reason for the report is that there was more engagement 20 years ago, as well as the reduction in focus currently and the shocking levels of unemployment, poverty and emigration.<\/p><p> InterTradeIreland, which the Minister mentioned, is a fantastic organisation.  I worked on one of those projects discussed by the Minister, but it has suffered severe cuts.  We had recommendations from the North-South Retail Forum, which was set up by Retail Excellence Ireland and its Northern counterpart.  It considered that a North-South structure for retail was necessary.  Its understanding, from the Minister's perspective, was that it was not necessary and that there could be a discussion about it.  I would like to get an understanding of the Department's view, given that everybody believes that North-South co-operation is a good thing.  Everybody speaks of the benefits of an all-Ireland economy as having positive outputs.  A large number of those who have engaged in the process so far mentioned that we are retrenching rather than progressing on the issues of an all-Ireland economy, all-Ireland trade, developing those synergies and the practical elements of working together with our Northern counterparts.  What is the Minister's view on their engagement and how can we solve this?  Is it just inertia or, as one of the witnesses said, is it that governments are fire-fighting due to the crisis?  Has it fallen down the list of priorities, or there is something worse involved?  <\/p><p> In regard to the Border development zone, there is a serious problem.   As we may have more time than expected due to the lack of participants, I will leave it at that, and perhaps I might be able to speak again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#BB00200","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Before I invite the Minister to respond, it might be helpful if I read a quote from Dr. Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, to which the Deputy referred.

Looking at the hard numbers from our perspective, the IDA's performance in the Border region has resulted in an increase in employment of 21% in the past four years.  That is a strong performance by any standard.  There has been a 9% growth in terms of Enterprise Ireland's performance.  More than 600 companies are supported by Enterprise Ireland and there are 77 IDA-supported companies.  The region has its strengths and we are seeking to play to those strengths.  As the Deputy will be aware, from the perspective of the IDA, we are copperfastening those strengths with an investment in advanced facilities in Letterkenny, Dundalk and Sligo.  From our perspective, we are putting down a hard commitment to create a magnet for growth in the Border region.  There is not a policy fault line. <\/p> <p>  Clearly, in terms of cross-Border collaboration, the presence of InterTradeIreland and its success, although it has faced financial difficulties in recent years, is a very tangible expression of the sort of practical collaboration we can build.  We have had successes in research and development and in the placement of individuals in companies, with people of acumen facilitating cross-Border trade.  We have good examples of companies that, for the first time ever, were able to go across the Border and build an export-oriented base from which they grew more strongly.  Those are the most tangible areas.  What we are trying to do in the next round is to ensure more of that occurs and that the collaboration between companies is deepened to get it more embedded.<\/p> <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n remarked on the proportion of our trade that goes North.  He is right in that undoubtedly there is untapped potential there.  That illustrates the value of these programmes.  That is occurring in the overall context of a diversification of Irish trade away from the UK generally.  We have consciously sought to diversify our trade base.  The Deputy is right in saying there is more potential for trade with the North.  It would be good if we could get more traction on the examples given.  There have been some very good cases.  <\/p> <p>  Our move to establish local enterprises offices within the local authorities will hopefully mobilise the capacity of the local authorities.  There is a good deal of cross-Border interaction between local authorities.  I hope that putting resources into making those offices a first-stop shop, promoting innovation within them and now having competitive calls in which they can participate, will result in new thinking in this area.  In any of our regional strategies we are trying to promote new thinking and new collaborations out of what has been done in this period.  The Border region has done pretty well.  It is one of the stronger regions in performance terms in the recovery period.  We need to continue to build on that but to look to our strengths.  We have some fantastic companies there and we can build on their strengths.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of setting up new structures such as a retail structure, I do not think new structures are what we want.  InterTradeIreland is a good structure, it is delivering North and South and it has real programmes.  If there are initiatives that need to be developed, let us spin them out there.  Clearly, if retailers want to form a structure of their own in the way CBI or IBEC has formed one, that is to be encouraged, but whether we want to set up structures additional to InterTradeIreland at this point would be open to question.

Perhaps I am building on Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n&rsquo;s contribution in saying that while InterTradeIreland is very successful, its executives are frustrated, as are experts in the field, about the level of budget cuts being inflicted on the agency.

The point is everything is wild until one reaches the Border or everything is ancient until one reaches the Border.  While I acknowledge the Minister will state it is political and there are cross-Border institutions, where is the push?  Where is the impetus and where is the sense of the Irish Government, which is the Government on which one depends, pushing beyond that Border and pushing everything possible from beyond that Border?  Where is the push coming in respect of enterprise?  While the Minister has commented on the potential of a BrExit, will he reflect on this again, if he does not mind?

In general, I refer to enterprise infrastructure.  For instance, there is the ongoing issue about the credit guarantee scheme and its extension to cover banks that are exiting the market.  This is a cross-Border issue because one of the banks causing the trouble has its headquarters across the Border.  What kind of work is under way there?  I get a sense that the Border is limiting the Government in a way that no Irish Government should be limited by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#GG00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Obviously, there is the Border, so North and South operate in two different jurisdictions with different Parliaments to which they are answerable.  This clearly is a reality and what the Government has built is cross-Border institutional collaboration which it has turned into the channels it considers are best for driving real change.  Consequently, there is significant collaboration on the research area, innovation, exporting and cross-Border placement of people from colleges to build those connections.  This is highly practical.  Yes, in recent years there have been efficiency economies expected of InterTradeIreland and that has been true of most State agencies.  This year, as members are aware, there is a particular problem with the budgeting in the North.  While a number of parties are involved, the consequence has been a deeper cut than the one that was agreed originally between the Departments of Finance of the two jurisdictions.  A deeper cut is being made there and while we are managing to live within it thus far, that is a particular budgetary fall-out that has occurred as a result of the discussions going on in the North on their budgets at present.<\/p> <p>  However, there is a tangible record of success in this regard.  One might state this is something on which one can build more quickly, and one hopes this will be the case.  The Government is trying to build a stronger regional strategy and to put in place institutions that can be more collaborative.  The local enterprise offices are in a position with their partnership or, if one likes, their parentage within the local authority, albeit under a service level agreement with the Department, whereby it is possible to promote collaboration as it delivers success.  However, I would not be doing my job unless I set targets of delivery, and in any competition for resources the Department will be running, it will wish to see impact.  Consequently, just because there is collaboration between individuals does not mean it will get them an automatic buy.  The Government will wish to ascertain that such collaboration is producing something genuine in terms of output.  As this is the approach the Department takes, when people are competing for funds, it must be about the impact on the things that matter to people, such as whether they can promote more trade, more innovation, more start-up hubs and, ultimately, more jobs.  I have been very impressed with some of the legacy.  I visited The Hive in County Leitrim, as I am sure has the Deputy, and it is a very exciting and good operation.  The investment in science parks in Letterkenny and Derry has significant potential.<\/p><p>We are funding a great deal of research collaboration, particularly through SFI, in the context of Horizon 2020, which has &euro;80 billion in funding resources.  We are attempting to corral such collaboration, North and South, to try to win more of the resources available under Horizon 2020.  We are working in a very practical way to try to maximise what we can achieve, both through the institutions and by means of the opportunities that exist.<\/p><p> Institutional development is a bigger political issue and the Deputy must recognise that negotiations relating to it need to be carried out in a particular way.  We are promoting the tools that can be used to generate more practical collaboration.  If there are new ideas that we might test, we would be very keen to do so.  To be fair, some of the collaboration that has already taken place here has gained recognition internationally as constituting best practice in the context of cross-Border collaboration between two jurisdictions.  What we are doing is recognised internationally as being very innovative.  I accept that more can be done and it is hoped we will develop our activities further.  However, the Deputy should not pretend this is not a successful model.  It is recognised internationally as being such a model but I accept we can do more.

I have not seen the report.  My general opinion on institutional innovation is that I start with policy actions.  It is only if the policy action cannot be delivered by existing institutional arrangements that I start to look at new institutions.  I have been around a long time and have seen a lot of energy put into setting up institutions.  What we should put our energy into is using existing institutions to drive practical policy initiatives.  If there are practical policy initiatives that we can bring forward then let us have a look at them and see if existing institutional arrangements can deliver them.  If that cannot be done, then let us consider what institutional innovations are needed.  That is my general approach.  I have tried to take out structures and simplify matters.  I have merged the LEOs back into local authorities.  I have also put a centre of excellence within an existing body, in Enterprise Ireland, to oversee them.  That dynamic is working.  We have robbed counties of institutions, boards and so on, but the innovation has worked.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the policy initiatives that we are trying to drive.  What we have been able to do through such an approach is to get the young entrepreneurs thing going.  We also use local authorities.  LEOs are now big players and have more than doubled the output generated by microfinance.  We also gave them new mandates.  That would be my approach generally.  If there is material in this study then perhaps we should look at whether local enterprise offices can be partners or if an initiative can be taken.  That is my preference for approaching this matter, but my view is based on what I know.  I will take a look at the report published by Retail Excellence Ireland but I have outlined my policy presumption.  I do not want to invest in institutions; I want to invest in actions that deliver on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#KK00600","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I want to ask the Minister to give his view on a comment made by Mr. Paul Mac Flynn from the Nevin Economic Research Institute during the previous session of today's meeting.

Investors will look, for example, at Manchester and different locations.  An agency that is trying to win foreign direct investment, whatever its geographic mandate, will compete, and that has always been the case.  I do not see competition as a bad thing.  The more Ireland is promoted as a good place to invest, and the more vibrant the competition is, then the better it is for both sides.  We will win some and we will lose some, but promotion has a good impact.  I can see where we can increase collaboration.  We can look at whether there are sub-supply opportunities within an FDI base, which is a concept that we have tried to promote.  Last year, we had a trade mission to Ireland in which a number of companies visited what were effectively multinationals and Irish companies in terms of building a sub-supply chain.<\/p><p>We need to look at the sub-supply chain.  InterTradeIreland is well placed to do that and it has already provided programmes on public procurement, the Go-2-Tender programme, which is very successful and gets companies familiar with what it takes to win tenders.  That is the sort of collaboration we can build.  We can allow companies to participate in Enterprise Ireland programmes for capability building, but when we are competing head-to-head for an individual investment, we are competing with many locations, although that does not mean we are not building a stronger economy and promoting trade and collaboration in many other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015052600002#KK00800","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432643400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Bruton, and his official, Mr. Curran, for attending today's meeting to discuss this important topic.<\/p> <p>  It is proposed to suspend the sitting until 5.45 p.m., when we will resume in public session to consider the Companies Act 2014 (section 1313) regulations 2015 in draft.

In preparation for the commencement on 1 June 2015 of the Companies Act 2014, a number of statutory instruments are to be issued to deal with functional issues related to the operation of the Act.  The statutory instrument before us is one which requires positive approval by the Oireachtas.  It concerns the application of certain aspects of company law to unregistered companies, specifically the Bank of Ireland.  None of these provisions is new and the purpose of the statutory instrument is to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.<\/p><p>Company law applies to companies which are formed and registered under the Companies Act.  However, unregistered companies still exist and the Bank of Ireland is the main unregistered company in Ireland, having been formed under a royal charter in 1783.  Notwithstanding its unregistered status, the Bank of Ireland must still comply with company law.  As a result, there has always been a provision in company law to allow specific provisions to be applied to the bank.  In the Companies Act 2014, this is achieved by way of maintaining all law relating to unregistered companies in a single Part, which is supplemented by a table contained in the Schedules.  Section 1313 of the Act is the relevant provision.  It provides that the table in Schedule 14 may be extended to include any relevant provision in the rest of the Act.  The statutory instrument before us applies the provisions listed in Article 4 to the Bank of Ireland. <\/p><p>If Members wish, I will go through each article and the various provisions being applied line by line.  It is important to note, however, that the provisions before us do not do anything new.
