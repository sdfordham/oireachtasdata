We are concerned that a blind eye is being turned to the employment implications of recent developments which will be devastating, given the nature of the coastal communities in which the factories are located.  The mackerel quota is the State's most valuable quota.  <br\/><br\/>There are 12 registered pelagic processing factories in the country - eight in County Donegal and one each in Rossaveal, Baltimore, Dingle and Castletownbere.  These factories mainly process mackerel, herring, horse mackerel, sprat and blue whiting.  <br\/><br\/>There are 50 boats in the fleet with a pelagic quota entitlement.  There are 23 in the refrigerated sea water, RSW, sector which are currently allocated 87% of the mackerel quota.  A total of 21 of the 23 are Killybegs based.  There are 27 boats in the polyvalent fleet, based mainly on the south coast.  They are allocated the remaining 13% of the mackerel quota.<br\/><br\/>The difficulty with supply for some factories arises because of a major difference between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s stated policy on quota allocation and the policy actually practised on the ground.  The Department's policy document, Fisheries Quota Management in Ireland, April 2016, statest: <\/p><blockquote>In Ireland quota is a public resource and is managed to ensure property rights are not granted to individual operators.  This is seen as a critical policy in order to ensure that quotas are not concentrated into the hands of large fishing companies whose owners have the financial resources to buy up such rights.  In Ireland, any movement towards privatization and concentration of rights into the hands of large companies would seriously risk fishing vessels losing an economic link with Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities and undermining the socio economic importance of the fishing industry in coastal communities dependent on fishing. <\/blockquote> <p>This is the stated policy, but it is not happening on the ground.  Large Killybegs based companies which already control much of the quota are actively encouraging fishermen whose boats have licences with a pelagic quota entitlement to sell their boats, offering prices well in excess of their economic value.  This trend has serious implications for fishing ports in the south and west.  In Rossaveal three boats have been sold to Killybegs based companies in the past year.  These boats were the main suppliers to Iasc Mara Teoranta for decades and accounted for over 60% of the fish supply to the factory.  The reported prices paid for the boats were &euro;5 million, &euro;6 million and &euro;8 million.  Of these prices about 20% relates to the actual cost of the boats and 80% to the licences and the pelagic quota entitlements.  All of the fish from them is now processed in Killybegs or outside the country.  This has put the future of Iasc Mara Teoranta in jeopardy.  It is also a major blow to the local fisherman&rsquo;s co-op that handled their fish and all of the service providers and small businesses in the Rossaveal area.  In total, five Rossaveal based boats have been bought by companies in Killybegs in recent years.  There are now no active pelagic boats based in Rossaveal. <br\/><br\/>The Department&rsquo;s stated policy had absolutely no effect in preventing these purchases of quotas and vessels.  In effect, the Department is refusing to police its own policy.  This trend is continuing and other factories are concerned that, in time, their suppliers will also be bought up.  Four companies in Killybegs handle over 80% of the pelagic quota through boats that they own or boats that they control and which land exclusively for them.  Unless the Department takes immediate action to change the way the mackerel quota is allocated and take vessels and factories into account, the number of pelagic factories in the country will reduce from 12 to five or six in the short term.<\/p><p>This will result in a loss of 300 to 400 jobs around the coast and would leave many ports with little or no fishing activity as all of the activity will be concentrated in one port. <\/p><p> For many years we have regularly raised the issue of supply difficulties with the Department officials and with the then Minister.  More recently we wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed in November 2016 with a proposal to secure the supply of mackerel for the 12 factories and to save the jobs in fish processing and related services around the coast.  I will come to the detail of the proposal shortly.  In January 2017, the Minister, Deputy Creed announced a Consultation Paper on a Review of Mackerel Allocation Policy between the Fleet Segments.  The letter announcing the consultation process made reference to a request made by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation Ltd, but, made no reference to our proposal.  After considering the submissions received, the Minister will decide whether to change the percentage allocation between the polyvalent and the RSW fleet.  This consultation process applies to the 10,600 tonne increase in the 2017 mackerel quota only and does not address access by processors to the resource in different regions. <\/p><p> At present, the national mackerel quota for 2017 is 86,426 tonnes.  This is allocated 87% or 75,190 tonnes to the vessels in the RSW sector and 13% or 11,235 tonnes to the vessels in the polyvalent sector.  However, this may change when the Minister has completed his review. <\/p><p> To put these figures in perspective, the four factories in the south processed a total of 3,000 tonnes out of a total quota of 76,000 tonnes in 2016.  This amounts to 4%, an average of 1% per factory of the total mackerel quota.  Factories cannot survive on these volumes and these four factories, employing more than 240 people directly and indirectly are particularly at risk. <\/p><p> Our proposal is that in view of the urgency of the crisis confronting the smaller processors, it is proposed that on a pilot basis 12,000 tonnes, or approximately 14% of the quota, should be allocated to processors in 2018 - 1,000 tonnes to each of the 12 registered pelagic factories in the State.  The remaining quota would then be allocated to the RSW sector and to the polyvalent sector. <\/p><p> It is envisaged that the factories will then allocate this quota on a tonne for tonne basis to the boats and pay the market price for the fish.  In this way, each factory would receive a minimum of 2,000 tonnes of mackerel per annum.  Of the 12,000 tonnes, 8,000 tonnes would be allocated to factories in Donegal.  It is envisaged that the quota allocated to the smaller factories will be applied to the polyvalent fleet.  This proposal is a step towards aligning the current practice on the ground with the Department&rsquo;s stated policy.  This proposal will also provide an incentive for boats to land their quota in the State, increase employment and value added in the State and promote a more even distribution of activity by region.<\/p><p> We realise that this represents a change from the traditional way the quota has been allocated.  If the Department comes up with an alternative proposal that ensures a fair distribution of fish to all factories, we are willing to listen.  The present regime ensures that we do not have access to purchase 90% of the fish. <\/p><p> It is very important to note that factory employees, fish processors, service providers, crewmen, fishermen and local communities are all stakeholders in this industry and all deserve to be considered when the quota is being allocated.  This issue is not new to the Department and has been flagged long before the present Minister, Deputy Creed, was appointed. <\/p><p> I am asking the Chairman and committee members to take this matter up with the Minister and his officials in the Department to find a way to implement our proposal or, an acceptable alternative.  Our proposal will not cost the State any money, but will ensure the continuation of employment in coastal communities and help to keep these communities alive. <\/p><p> Go raibh maith agaibh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Groonell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Groonell.

What the Department is saying in its mission statement is that this should not happen, that the rules state it should not happen.  Yet it is happening.  It is a very basic principal and we must hold the Department to account.  On the broader issue, most people are clearly of the view that the problem we have in the fishing industry is around the distribution of the quota system.  The system needs to be overhauled following a review.<\/p> <p>  Brexit will also impact on it as well.  The problem that Mr. Groonell highlighted to the committee is uniquely internal to the Irish fleet.  Normally we are considering problems created by foreign factory ships and boats taking a huge amount of our resource.  We should be able to do something fairly swiftly and with a level of success if we put our minds to it.  In truth, the Department simply has to come up to the mark and do what it states on the tin.  The Department has to do what it is supposed to do.

I have a certain sympathy with their position in respect of the availability of fish and it is something that small processors in County Donegal have difficulty with as well, although that would seem to be lost in some of the cases that are made, which is that basically Killybegs is hoovering up everything.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on whether the fish producers and exporters association would be supportive of the Iasc Mara Teoranta's proposal and the legality of it.<\/p><p>I am not sure but I would imagine that only those boats that have licences to catch mackerel can actually receive the quota.  I do not know how factories could be given a licence to catch or whether or not the Government could change the process to licence factories to allow them to receive a quota.  I understand fully what the witnesses are saying about Iasc Mara Teoranta's factories managing to get product to process and the knock-on effect that has on jobs but if this measure was to be implemented then the converse would have the same effect.  Killybegs, and the work in the factories, has been decimated over the years through the modernisation programme within the factories.  The working season has collapsed for most working people in Killybegs who depend on the factories for a livelihood.  This proposal would have a further impact on those people and this is not reflected in the submission.  This should be taken into account.  I do not know what the solution to that could be.  The Department says that it is progress but I do not know - it depends on one's definition of progress.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the figures in the presentation.   The witnesses have said that the four factories process 3,000 tonnes and that the current regime ensures that they do not have access to purchase 90% of the fish.

This would be 8,500 tonnes, which would actually meet the targets the witness have referenced in their proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#E00700","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Others have access also to that 10%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Groonell"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>So it is based on price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#F00300","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Yes.

We were constantly told by the Department that it was the market and that boats are entitled to go wherever the market takes them in respect of processing.  This was the difficulty for many years.

I want to ask about the public consultation period which is happening now.  This is being looked at.  Has Iasc Mara Teoranta made a submission to that consultation and fitted into the actual process itself?  Is this a part of the witnesses submission and is this what they propose by public consultation?  It seems like a radical change in policy to put it bluntly.  If I get what the company is trying to do, in a nutshell it is trying to move the quota from the boats to the processors.  If this is being proposed it would be a drastic change, naturally, to the policy itself.  I wonder if there is support in the community for that.  The witnesses have said that 90% of the market is tied up but others would say that 10% is not tied up and that it is based on price.  In my part of the world if one was to equate that to the milk quota - from back in the day - it was attached to the land and the farm.  It was not attached to the co-operatives.  Are we now proposing that the mackerel quota would be attached to the processors?  What would the feeling be in the community itself in that regard?  On the other side, if we were to go along with this proposal, would there be a backlash from communities over who had ownership of these quotas?  They are a great commodity and it is a bit like everything else in that people have banked on these quotas.  It is one of the key things on which the Chairman might get clarity for me.  If we are going to have situation where the quota regime is going to move drastically from the fishermen onto the manufacturer it would be helpful, in order to progress, to see what the community's views are on what would be a major, grave step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#F00600","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We will now come back to Mr. Groonell.

We will answer them between us as they are different.  I will take the queries raised by Senator Mac Lochlainn about the position of the fishing organisations.  Part of the question goes directly to part of our problem - that in our opinion the Department focuses on the boats and the fishermen entirely in the allocation of quotas and it does not look to see what the impacts are on employment and processing.  The quota is a national resource and this is well spelled out in the Department's policy.  The State gets value from that quota when it is actually processed in Ireland.  If the fish is landed abroad, for example, it is lost to us and there is very little gain for the State from it.  If the fish is landed in Ireland and processed here then there is a value to the State.  In fact, the more processing and the more value added here then the more value is gained by the State from the resource.  The fishing organisations dominate the quota management committees.  Even within our own processors' organisation many of the members are boat owners also.  We would be a bit unique in the 12 factories.  Not many of the 12 registered pelagic factories would not be owned by boat owners.  There is a very dominant position by fishermen and boats in the decision making and the Department seems to only confer with the fishermen in making the decisions.  For example, we-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Groonell"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Groonell saying there is a divergence of view between Iasc Mara Teoranta and the views of the producers and organisations?

What is good for the boat is that they get their quota, they take it and they land it wherever the best price is available, be it in Norway or Shetland or wherever.  There is no tie-in to getting value for the State in this whole process.  That is lacking.  For many years the boats were not as big as they are now, we had a fair enough fleet in Rossaveal and it all worked reasonably well.  There has been a dramatic change, however, in the last five years in particular.  There is a huge change in the way the business has gone.  We would consider ourselves to be a small operation in the whole thing, but as has been said there smaller companies in Killybegs who are also feeling the very cold wind of what is happening now.  It is time for the Department to take another look at the way it makes the decisions and to see if four or five companies owning and processing the whole lot is a good result.  This is the question.  In our opinion the State is a lot better off with 12 factories around the coast where employment can be created.

We have thought long and hard about this.  We were involved in many campaigns down through the years to get more fish for the polyvalent sector, namely the small boats and those located in Rossaveel, Dingle and Baltimore.  We were reasonably successful.  When Mr. Tony Killeen was Minister of State, he changed the allocation.  That was the last time.  He got a fairly substantial increase for the polyvalent sector at that time.  At the end of the day, what did it do for us?  It made those boats more valuable and now they are suddenly the target of the bigger operators.  The latter are saying those boats have a bigger quota now and are worth buying.  One can see the prices paid for them.  We have looked at every side of this.  We really cannot see any proposal other than the one we have here.

It is a valid question.  The first thing that has to be established is who owns the quota.  It is very clear in the Department's policy statement who owns it.  When one sees the big prices people are prepared to pay for boats with quota entitlements, one must ask what they are buying.  They are happy in the knowledge that they are actually buying the quota entitlement.  That is a question.  It is in the policy document also that the Minister decides how the quota is allocated.  We envisage, for example, that the 1,000 tonnes would be allocated to the factory but that the factory would then have to allocate perhaps 100 tonnes at a time to ten boats or 200 tonnes at a time to five boats.  That quota would be attached to the boats' licences for 2018.  From the factory's point of view, in order to be policed or whatever, that amount of quota would actually have to be on the boats' licences.  It is like everything else in that if the Department wants to do it, it can find a way.  There are approximately 20 people working in the fish policy section of the Department.  If they have the will to do it, it will not be beyond their means to find a way to do it.  We only have what we have from our side of the house but they would have access to a lot more.  That is a question for the officials.  Let me give a very simple analogy.  An analogy was made to the milk quota.  If a corner shop owner has a lotto licence and is the selling shop, the next owner does not necessarily get the licence.  He has to go through the whole rigmarole of applying.  I know this from the experience of a friend of mine.  There is no guarantee that the new owner of the shop will get the licence.  In Rossaveel, however, all the boats were bought.  There was no question.  A licence that is worth a multiple of the value of a lotto licence seems to be just rubber-stamped and it is said one has everything.  There seems to be no real care taken to account for the socio-economic link with the boat and the question of whether it should be allowed go willy-nilly to another area.<\/p> <p>  There are many ways of looking at this.  For the past three years, we have lost substantial money as a company.  We we are trying to hang on and we are fighting our corner.  We believe we are obliged to fight on behalf of the company.  We fight for our own jobs and for our staff's jobs.  We are fighting also for the port of Rossaveel.  If we walk away, the port will be in a bad way.  It will be a marina.  That is not good enough.  We are fighting on.  We are losing money so we cannot hang on indefinitely.  If there is no result or change, it will not make sense to repeat it for a number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Groonell"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The objective is absolutely laudable in terms of making sure as much processing as possible can happen on the island.  The jobs and the added value come from that.  The objective is one that we have to be pursuing.  We must try to exploit the opportunity that exists in this regard.<\/p> <p>  If I heard Mr. Groonell clearly, he is saying that up to 12,000 tonnes of the quota to which different fisherman would have purchased an entitlement over the years should be allocated, without charge, to the 12 factories and that each of those factories would then have its own separate agreement with fishermen, whereby the 1,000 tonnes per factory would be allocated to the fishermen.  Mr. Groonell's organisation and the fishermen would then agree a price for the fish.  Mr. Groonell is saying the market price.  One can always argue about the market price.  The market price is the price for which one can purchase on the open market.  It basically means that the processor gets the quota.  It can then do the deal on the price.  It has the potential to agree a price with fishermen.  With regard to the legalities, that strikes me as interference in the market.  I do not know whether the delegation has explored this.  The interference would have all sorts of implications in terms of State aid and in respect of two companies.  That is what strikes me about this.<\/p><p> I asked a question about current access to fish.  Is it the case that for some of the processing companies to be able to operate and make a profit, they need to be able to get fish at a price lower than what is available on the open market or is it the case that there is no fish on the open market and they have nowhere to go to get that fish?  Am I right in saying that because the polyvalent boats that were bought up are smaller and would have been based locally, they would have been delivering the catch only into the local ports?  Am I wrong in saying that they would not have had the capacity to go internationally, whereas the bigger boats can land in different countries depending on the price available?  Is that the case?  The larger boats have to pay a higher price because they have a wider market in terms of choosing where they go to get the best price for their catch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#G00900","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Which witness would like to deal with those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#H00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will deal with the earlier part.

In that respect and in terms of competition, there is no difference between what is happening and what we are proposing.

The Department has also spoken directly with Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club and the Bord na gCon stakeholder forum on the issues being address in this draft general scheme.<\/p> <p>  In broad terms the draft heads are intended to strengthen governance, improve\u00a0regulation in the sport and make it more transparent, and to give Greyhound Racing Ireland a very clear role in relation to the welfare of greyhounds.  I will provide greater detail as we go through the document head by head but I will now give a broad overview of some of the key provisions.  We propose to rename of Bord na gCon.  We believe the time is right, with the promulgation of this new Bill, for a new start for the organisation.  We also intend to improve governance.  The heads of the Bill provide for an increase in the size of the board\u00a0to a maximum of eight,\u00a0with fixed terms for the chairman and ordinary members and a maximum number of terms for each.  The increase in the size of the board will facilitate the appointment of individuals with specific expertise as necessary.<\/p> <p>  The heads of the Bill also lay down the functions of the board around the administration, governance, regulation, development and promotion of the greyhound industry and there are statutory provisions for the delegation of functions to a chief executive.\u00a0 Members of the board, the control committee and the appeals committee are subject to a statutory maximum of two terms.<\/p> <p>  The board is being provided with the statutory powers to introduce a comprehensive set of anti-doping rules, including the ability to make regulations prohibiting certain substances and setting limits for other substances.  The matters that Bord na gCon can investigate are being extended and include matters in relation to welfare of greyhounds.  The powers of authorised officers are being amplified for a variety of purposes including investigating the use of prohibited substances.  In addition, the powers of entry and inspection of authorised officers are being greatly strengthened.<\/p> <p>  With regard to disciplinary processes and structures the legislation proposes that the control committee should be provided for in primary legislation, with its functions and independence clearly outlined.  Its members will be appointed by the Minister, rather than the board, and will include at least one veterinary practitioner and a practising solicitor or barrister.  Decisions in relation to breaches of the racing code will be transferred from the board to the control committee, and the legislation also provides for a statutory appeals committee which will also be independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p><p>The jurisdiction of both the control committee and appeals committee extends to people participating in the sport of greyhound racing, including the training, sale or breeding of greyhounds for racing, who are subject to the racing code.  The heads also provide for the publication of the decisions of the control committee and the appeals committee.  <\/p><p> On sanctions, the legislation provides for administrative, rather than criminal, sanctions for breaches of the racing code and increases financial sanctions to a maximum of &euro;5,000.  Currently the legislation provides that dogs may be disqualified from racing and trials.  The Bill extends the scope of disqualification orders to transfer of ownership, sale and use in breeding activities.  The Bill also provides that exclusion orders issued by the control committee, which prohibit persons from attending race tracks or public sales, will have like effect at coursing meetings, and similarly that exclusion orders issued by the Irish Coursing Club will apply equally at greyhound racing meetings.  <\/p><p> An amendment is being proposed to the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 to allow the board to make regulations to ensure that bitches have only eight litters certified  for racing, regardless of where the litter is born.  This is to ensure that the current legislation is not being circumvented by sending bitches abroad to have additional litters where eight are registered in this jurisdiction.  These are some of the key elements of the Bill.<\/p><p> This sector needs a strong governance and regulatory framework.  I look forward to working with the committee to ensure that that objective is met as we work our way through the heads this evening.  We have circulated a highlighted version of the Bill.  In part, it is to assist me and also members.  It is not intended in any way to deflect discussion from any part of the Bill.  They are simply matters I believed might be worth highlighting.  I recognise we are at the start of a process here.  What we end up with in this Bill might be somewhat different from what we present here tonight.  We are open to that possibility, subject to obtaining legal advice and approval from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>As Mr. Gleeson says, this is the start of the process.

To the extent that I am aware of the public narrative around this, the tendency seems to be to suggest that not enough resources are put into welfare.  Whatever about the tensions around this, there is a State body established here with its own functions under Statute.  It has to manage the industry and make determinations on how resources are deployed.  We are providing a legal framework for it to deploy those resources.  It is not our intention to - and we could not really - bind its hands extremely specifically in legislation.  It should be directed by Government policy, public sentiment and so forth.<\/p> <p>  Section B outlines the general functions of Greyhound Racing Ireland and provides for the delegation of executive functions in line with the recommendations of the Indecon report.  The Indecon report suggested, not in a pejorative sense, that there was an unusual degree of involvement by the board in executive decisions and day-to-day operational matters.  Our view is that certain functions of Greyhound Racing Ireland are carried out by the board but the day-to-day executive operational matters should be carried out by a chief executive.  The function of a board should be to provide guidance, set policy, monitor the implementation of that policy and so forth but the chief executive should be responsible for doing what has to be done on a day-to-day basis.<\/p><p>It is a normal division of governance responsibilities, which we have stated in our document.

The committee might argue that it is unnecessary but we have chosen to follow the recommendation. <\/p><p> Head 10 explicitly requires that the board has regard to the code of governance for State bodies.  It does anyway.  One can argue that the provision is superfluous but, again, we wanted a make a specific reference to the code of governance in the Bill.  The provision is short and simple.  <\/p><p> Heal 11 explicitly brings the activities of board subsidiaries within the ambit of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I want to make it clear that there is no issue but at present the board produces a consolidated account, which includes the activities of all of the subsidiary companies.  The subsidiary companies produce their own accounts that are lodged with the Companies Registration Office.  By convention, the Comptroller and Auditor General audits the accounts of the subsidiaries.  We wanted to put this matter beyond all legal doubt.  It is not that an issue has ever arisen or there is a risk to the convention.  We feel that we should not rely on a convention for subjecting these particular accounts to an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and that is why we have provided for same in this legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Is there a specific date by which to submit the accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#N00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>The code of governance provides that completed accounts for State agencies must be completed by the end of August of the following year.

There are also powers afforded to the board to regulate various bits of legislation, including the Welfare of Greyhounds Act and the animal remedies Bill.  There are powers afforded to the board to regulate under various piece of legislation, including the Welfare of Greyhounds Act and the Animal Remedies Act.  We have brought these powers into the legislation that deals with greyhound racing.  Unapologetically, we are saying these are powers for the regulation of greyhound racing.  They are not powers for the regulation of medicines or other things.  We are saying that we want the Greyhound Racing Control Board to have the power to regulate because these substances can interfere with integrity in the greyhound racing sector.  By that I mean they can increase or inhibit the performance of a dog or interfere with the welfare of a dog.

This is an empowering provision and this is the way these provisions are generally drafted.  It would be unusual if it did not draft such regulations.  There is much public narrative on this but it is an incredibly complex and technical area.  There are issues around this that I cannot explain to the Deputy.  With regard to deciding what substances can be prohibited and how they should be managed, the board has established a scientific advisory committee.  There are a number of experts on that committee, including the director of veterinary medicines in UCD and a Danish person.  The latter two people are on the veterinary medicines committee of the European Medicines Agency.  There are issues around whether one tests for the metabolites of a substance or the substance itself and they are incredibly technical.  What is needed here is empowerment for the board.  There are already regulations in these areas based on other legislative measures and the racing code.  However, it is impossible to provide for every situation and for every new substance in the regulations.  It is also impossible to provide for every new piece of technology that is developed which might be able to find substances at such an extraordinarily low level that they were never found previously.  It would not be appropriate, or even possible, to provide for mandatory provisions here.  It is too complicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The integrity of the industry has come under fire, unjustly I believe.  For me, this is the most important part of the Bill for the reputation of the industry.  I accept it is technical but surely a threshold can be inserted, such as finding minute substances that would not affect the performance of a dog.  In all tests for residues there is a tolerance level allowed as it does not have any impact on the safety of a product, whether it is a food or otherwise.  Surely the same thing can be worked into this, whereby some minute tolerance is inserted so that a minute trace of a substance is not going to disqualify a dog as it cannot affect his performance.  That is lacking at present.  One could say that if a dog drank a sup of tea before a race and was tested, he could fail the test.  That is not what we want from this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#O00700","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I will address that point as I go through the points here.  We are saying it has the power to prohibit substances.  Some substances should be prohibited and that is the end of it.  If they are banned and any amount of them are found, it is a problem.  We are saying the board can control substances by reference, class or otherwise that may be given to a greyhound.  If a substance is controlled, one is saying that the substance might be useable in certain circumstances.  For example, there are substances that have the potential to impact on the performance of a dog which might be legitimately used for therapeutic purposes.  I am not sure if any trainer has never medicated a dog, and they might have medicated the dog for perfectly reasonable reasons.<\/p> <p>  The next provision (c) addresses the exact point the Deputy makes.  It empowers the board to set limits for residues for controlled substances.  What does that mean?  Effectively, it means a limit will be set for the residues.  That addresses the Deputy's point.  In other words, if a test is conducted and a level above the limit is found, that is an adverse finding.  If something below the limit is found, it is not an adverse finding.  I spoke earlier about how technical this area is, and determining what those levels should be is not an arbitrary matter.  One needs people who know what they are talking about.  The reason the board has established the scientific advisory committee is so it can advise the board exactly on these issues.  When one applies penalties in these areas, they can be significant and the possibility of ending up in court over the application of a sanction is not insignificant, so it is important that when one sets a limit for a residue it has some scientific rigour behind it.  That addresses the point the Deputy made.<\/p> <p>  The next matter is about setting periods following the administration of a substance during which a greyhound may not participate in greyhound racing or trials.  The same thing happens in the food sector, where there are withdrawal periods.  If one medicates an animal, it cannot be slaughtered within a certain time of medication.  The same provision is here.  It provides for the publication of the substances that are prohibited or controlled.  Obviously people can only apply these rules or adhere to them if there is adequate publication of the rules.  It sets out procedures for recording substances given to a greyhound.  Those procedures would be applied by the keeper or trainer of a greyhound.  In other words, they might have to keep a medicines record.  It sets out procedures for notifying when a greyhound has been treated by a controlled substance.  One of the questions in my head is about who they would notify.  I will have to reflect on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Would there be a testing regime?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#O00900","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Yes, and there will be authorised officers.

This is not just about the policemen, but also about the participants in the industry having their own responsibilities and obligations.  We can, by regulation, require owners and trainers to regulate their own behaviour.  Again, it is an empowering provision to allow regulations to be made in that area.  Skipping over to (j), it provides for the sampling of greyhounds at any location and at any stage in a greyhound's life.  In (k) we refer to powers to approve laboratories and methods of analysis.  I will outline what might happen.  The board might find a substance or a result in its own or another laboratory.  However, somebody might have a sample tested in a private laboratory using an entirely different method of analysis and might arrive at a different result.  Again, it means that the official finding can be undermined unless there is a provision which allows the board to state that if somebody is going to challenge the finding, they must use its technique or an approved laboratory.<\/p> <p>  Provision (l) is something the board is doing at present anyway, which is publishing details of adverse analytical findings in respect of a prohibited or controlled substance.

These are exercisable where there is a risk of disease, a risk to the welfare of a greyhound or a breach of the racing code.  The powers do not extend to entering a domestic dwelling other than with the consent of the owner.  This is because this kind of power is only exercisable through the use of a search warrant, and the use of a search warrant is only appropriate where there are criminal offences.  The use of these powers is possible for breaches of the racing code because participants in racing are subjected to the rules of racing and the jurisdiction of the control committee under head 18.  The point here is that we have very extensive powers which extend through the next few heads, and it may be worth reading down through these powers.  They refer to entering and inspecting, at all reasonable times, any land or premises where a record relating to a greyhound is present or where equipment or machinery used in connection with a greyhound is present.  It is proposed to grant authorised officers the power to \"examine a greyhound animal feed, equipment, machinery or other thing\"; to require the name and address of a person; to inspect vehicles, equipment, machinery, etc.; to require a person to provide them with such assistance as they need and copies of records; to take, without making a payment, samples from a greyhound animal feed, water, equipment or machinery; and to restrain a greyhound.<\/p> <p>  Page 29 outlines what the authorised officer can do where there is a risk of disease, a risk to the welfare of a greyhound or a breach of the racing code.  The committee will note that the authorised officer can search land or a premises, search a vehicle, equipment or machinery, require a person in charge or in control of the vehicle to refrain from moving it, give information regarding its place, seize and detain animal feed, and remove equipment or machinery.  The proposed subsection (5) states, \"An authorised officer shall not enter, except with the consent of the occupier, a private dwelling.\"<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain something about this, and I hope I explain it adequately because it is a little complicated.  There are offences under this Act which are criminal offences, and in those circumstances it is possible to seek a warrant to search a domestic dwelling.  We have provided that breaches of the doping provisions are breaches of the racing code.  In those circumstances, we have all these extensive powers for authorised officers but we do not have the power to get a search warrant or enter a person's home.  Why did we put these doping provisions under the racing code rather than the criminal provisions?  As well as being an industry, this is a sport, and we want a system that allows for the reasonably quick administration of justice in circumstances in which there are breaches of the racing code.  We felt that this was best achieved by providing that these provisions regarding doping are breaches of the racing code and should go to the control committee and be appealed to the appeals committee, and we will make reasonably quick decisions then as to whether a sanction is applicable.  These provisions were included for the sake of speedy resolutions to such matters.  Because we are dealing with a sport, we decided these should be breaches of the racing code and not offences.  There are offences under the legislation, but these are not offences, and we think that is a very good thing.  That is the advantage of this idea.  We provided that these be administrative sanctions.  The disadvantage is that one cannot get a search warrant or enter a person's home.  We have thought about this because it is a significant enough issue and we felt that this was still the right way to go, that is, that we give authorised officers extensive powers and that where we find a problem, there is reasonably quick administration of the case and an administrative sanction applied.  The administrative sanctions are significant.  They are equivalent to what one would get in a district court.  However, we do not want to have to go through the courts system every time an adverse finding is made in respect of doping, for example, because we feel this would result in interminable delays, to be honest.  That is why we have made these provisions and why  I draw the committee's attention to the provision in the proposed subsection (5).<\/p><p>What we are talking about is the administration of the racing code and racing sanctions rather than the criminal offences.  If we decided these are to be criminal offences, we could get a search warrant and search somebody's house but then every offence would have to go through the courts system.  That is an issue that requires some reflection but I wanted to draw it to the members' attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#P01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Any questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#Q00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>This may be a stupid question but if it was discovered that somebody was supplying prohibitive substances or something like that, that would be a criminal rather than an administrative offence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#Q00300","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>We are talking about legislation that specifically deals with greyhound racing.

Several times on this committee, people have discussed making it more independent in the exercise of its functions.  That is not to suggest that those already on the control committee are not independent in the exercise of their functions.  We wanted to establish a control committee by statute, as a statutory committee in its own right.  Under the old regime, it was the board that appointed the members of the control committee.  We are providing here that it is the Minister who appoints them.  <\/p> <p>  The control committee's function is to determine matters in respect of racing sanctions.  We have already had a discussion on that.  The members can see the list of persons to whom they might apply: owner, trainer, agent, kennelhand, handler of a greyhound - there is a very extensive list in subsection (4).  Any person who enters a greyhound in a greyhound race subjects themselves to the jurisdiction of the control committee and the appeal committee in respect of any breach of the racing code.  That may result in the imposition of a sanction.  That locks people into the jurisdiction of the control committee and the appeal committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#R01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>It is a good development that they are to be appointed by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#R02000","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>It is important that this is now provided for in primary legislation.  It is a body in its own right.  The members are appointed by the committee.  We have provided for a significant increase in the number of people on the control committee.  I will come back to that in a while.  It is so they can move along more quickly than they do at present.  We have also provided by statute that they should be provided with whatever resources they need to conduct a case.  We have provided a mechanism that is included in the Horse Racing Ireland Bill, to the effect that if there is any dispute between the committee and Greyhound Racing Ireland as to those resources, they can get an arbitrator in to make a determination which would be binding on both parties.<\/p> <p>  In practice, these are not issues for the committee but we wanted it sewn into the legislation here to make it clear that this is a body which is independent of Greyhound Racing Ireland and can ask Greyhound Racing Ireland for any resources that it needs and would have some mechanism for ensuring that it gets those resources if there is any dispute about them.  That all comes later in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Head 19 concerns disqualification orders.  These relate to specified greyhounds, \"kept, owned, trained or managed by a specified person\".  These are dogs disqualified from entry in any greyhound race, transfer of ownership - that is a new thing and we will come to it in a minute - acceptance for sale at any public sale, or use in breeding.  A disqualification order is a racing sanction.  As I understand it, it was at least technically possible through a kind of loophole in the current regime to transfer the ownership of a dog.<\/p><p>A disqualification order is served on an individual.  As I understand it, one very imaginative solution to that is that the individual could transfer the ownership of the dog to another individual and that, therefore, the disqualification order would not technically apply.  That is why we are adding this provision.  There may be more ingenious solutions to this but, in any event, we are trying to close off that particular loophole by preventing people from transferring ownership if a disqualification order is served.<\/p><p> The next topic is the exclusion orders under head 20.  Exclusion orders relate to persons and are issued by the controls committee, not the board.  That is part of the general dispensation here.  We are moving things from the board to the control committee, including the application of sanctions.  The proposed subsections (4) and (5) provide that anybody who receives an exclusion order from the board is also prohibited from attending a coursing meeting.  Anybody who receives an exclusion order from the ICC is prohibited from attending a greyhound racing track or from being at a public sale of greyhounds.  We were faced with the potential situation of somebody who is involved in the greyhound sector getting a sanction from one of the bodies regulating the sector, for example, the racing body.  That person could still go off and participate in coursing if he or she wished.  What we are now saying is that if a sanction of an exclusion order is applied by one of these bodies, it also applies to the other body's events.  That will be difficult to implement.  There is no doubt about that.  However, I think it is an important principle and it is established in this provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#R02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Okay.

I have spoken a bit about this already.  The control committee will be established for the first time as a creature of primary legislation.  Up to now, the functions of Bord na gCon were delegated to the committee by regulation.  In the proposed legislation, it is given independent statutory basis and functions which are to be exercised independently.  Its function is to decide whether there has been a breach of the racing code and to make determinations on the potential application of racing sanctions.  Subsection (3) states that it is independent in the exercise of its functions.  Subsection (4) states that it may make rules for its own procedures and shall publish those rules.  Transparency is important when one is administering rules like this.<\/p> <p>  We are increasing the number of members to a maximum of eight and allowing for the nomination of a deputy chairman.  The control committee currently sits with three members.  It was explicitly referenced in the Indecon report that work can take time, even though this body meets about once a month, and there can be backlogs of cases.  What we are allowing for in this provision is that there may be more than one committee operating at a time if there is a backlog.  Therefore, the committee could appoint a deputy chairman to sit on the separate committee to try to make its way through the backlog more quickly.  One would have to be careful to ensure there is consistency between the committees.

If it does that, we want to make sure that it is given the resource to cover that and to shore up its independence.  We have also provided explicitly for the power of the control committee to make policy recommendations to Greyhound Racing Ireland.  I believe that is a reasonably sensible provision.

I imagine the committee members will be familiar with the issue.  It is intended to deal with a potential loophole in the current welfare provision in respect of the ninth litter.<\/p> <p>  Section 11(3) of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act prohibits a person from causing or permitting a greyhound bitch to have more than six litters during her lifetime.  However, it allows two additional litters if a veterinary surgeon certifies that the pregnancy and birth do not represent a risk to the health or welfare of the bitch.  That brings the maximum to eight litters for greyhound bitches.<\/p> <p>  Section 11(4) of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act prohibits the keeper of the Irish greyhound stud book, namely, the Irish Coursing Club, from entering the progeny of litters in breach of that provision into the stud book.  Let us suppose a greyhound bitch has a ninth litter.  The progeny cannot be entered into the stud book.  However, there is a potential circumvention of that provision.  The potential circumvention is that a person could export the bitch to another jurisdiction, for example, a neighbouring jurisdiction.  Then, the bitch could have a ninth litter there.  There is an arrangement of reciprocity for registration in stud books between the UK and here.  Therefore, technically there is a way around this provision.<\/p> <p>  We are providing two lines that close off this potential loophole.  We are saying that progeny from the ninth litter or subsequent litters of a greyhound bitch shall not be certified to race.  Therefore, even if a person circumvents the registration of the stud book and a bitch has a ninth litter, it does not matter where she has it because the progeny of that litter cannot race.  This is a reasonably well understood problem and we are trying to close it off with this ninth litter provision.  We are also saying that a person who races a greyhound in contravention of these provisions commits a criminal offence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#T02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>There is an issue with regard to the straws used for insemination.

This provision states that: \"A greyhound registered in the stud book and certified to race by the Irish Coursing Club is eligible to race, unless the greyhound is the subject of a disqualification order.\"<\/p> <p>  This provision is intended to deal with a matter which has been the subject of some public commentary - the Deputy is right - over the past few years.  It relates to the eligibility of progeny of artificial insemination using semen from dogs which have been dead for more than two years.<\/p> <p>  I will try to go through this step by step.  In 2005 rules were introduced which permitted frozen semen from deceased stud sires to be used for artificial insemination, but only for two years after the death of the dog.  I think those rules were introduced potentially for two reasons.  One might have been a concern about the narrowing of the gene pool in the greyhound sector.  In other words, if one used semen from the same few dogs all the time and did not bring any kind of diversity into the breed it would be problematic.  <\/p> <p>  There might also have been a concern about how this might affect breeders - that is, people who were breeding dogs here - and whether there would be any demand for the semen.  <\/p> <p>  The reality is that this two-year limit was never enforced.  There might be various issues of practicality that others can explain better than I can, but it was not enforced.  It was clearly the intention to revoke the rule early on, but this was not done.  <\/p> <p>  In 2014 this was the subject of significant public commentary and people were unhappy that semen from these dogs was being used.  The Department took the view that either the rule should be changed or it should be applied.  The decision ultimately was that the board, with the consent of the Minister, introduced a statutory instrument in 2014, which removed this two-year restriction, so that the regulations matched the practice on the ground.<\/p> <p>  The board can make regulations anytime it wants to, limiting the use of semen from dogs.  In the meantime, however, there are progeny that were registered and that were the progeny of semen from dogs that were dead for more than two years.  The progeny of those progeny may be running now.  One could have several generations of dogs running which were the progeny of dogs that had been dead for several years.  <\/p> <p>  When we introduced the regulations in 2014 they drew a line under this and said that the rule was gone.  They could not apply it retrospectively, however, so there is a degree of debate about the eligibility of dogs to race or not.  There is a strong view that owners who registered dogs in a stud book and were certified to race, have a reasonable and legitimate expectation that they should be allowed to race.  There is also a view that once they were registered in a stud book they had to be allowed to race, so this is a difficult issue.  There are people out there who will never be satisfied that it has been dealt with appropriately.  I am saying that frankly and I am sure the committee will have people saying that in here. <\/p> <p>  We have tried to put the issue of the eligibility of dogs in the stud book to race beyond any doubt as of today.  We do not believe that there is an issue but we are putting it here in the primary legislation that any greyhound registered in the stud book and certified to race is eligible to race.  It therefore puts the issue beyond doubt for now.  We cannot put a provision in here that is retrospective in impact.  It cannot be done, but we are trying to put that particular issue beyond doubt to the extent that it is possible to do so.  That is what this provision is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Does that answer Deputy Kenny's question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Yes, I think so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The point is that if the straw was used from ten years ago and the dog was dead three or four years before that, up until 2014 there was an issue with that but it was not actually being dealt with in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00500","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>That is gone since then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00700","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491318000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>That rule is gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017040400002#U00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1491318000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>That is no longer the rule.

Last Wednesday was no exception as the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, formally started the Brexit process.  This process now presents many challenges for all of us as the UK and EU enter a new phase in their relationship.  As members are all aware, Ireland and the United Kingdom have a strong, mutual and unique relationship.

I look forward to a detailed, positive and constructive discussion following the ambassador's opening statement.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Before the ambassador begins, I would like to tell him something about our members that he will find very interesting.  I am very proud of the political track record of the members of this committee.  It might be of interest to the ambassador to note that the committee's political experience amounts to 218 years.  We are not exactly a very big committee but we have 218 years of political experience.  I am not going to name anyone in particular but there are two members on my right who between them have 84 years of political experience.  One has 41 years under his belt and the other has 43.  I thought the ambassador might be interested in that useless piece of information.<\/p><p>I thank the ambassador and his officials again for coming here today.  I invite him to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#A00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491303600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators very much for the invitation to address the committee today.  I am well aware of the very important contribution that this and other committees here at Leinster House make to the democratic process.  Indeed, one of my very first engagements as ambassador to Ireland was to address the Ceann Comhairle's EU symposium at the Mansion House, where I met many Members of the Houses for the first time.  I and my team attach great importance to engaging with members of the Oireachtas and will continue to ensure that we regularly spend time at Leinster House.  We will always be at the disposal of members of this committee.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The strong ties between Irish and UK parliamentarians are a really important element of our broader bilateral relationship, as evidenced by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, among other things.  It is in this context that I am here today to speak about the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  I propose to say a few words about the letter submitted from the Prime Minister to European Council President, Donald Tusk and about the next stages in the process, and I intend to say a little about the UK-Ireland dimension.  Then I look forward to hearing members' comments and trying to answer any questions they may have.  <br\/><br\/>As members are all aware, the Prime Minister wrote to the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, notifying him of the UK's intention to withdraw from the European Union, in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union.  Upon receipt of this letter, the two-year period for conducting the exit negotiations has begun.<br\/><br\/>The European Council will now agree guidelines on the EU's negotiating position, which we expect to be agreed at the European Council meeting on 29 April.  Once these guidelines are agreed, the European Commission will present its first draft negotiating mandate for adoption by the remaining EU member states.  Once that mandate has been approved, the Commission will formally open negotiations with the UK.  For our part, we stand ready to start talks on the substance as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>I am sure members have all seen the text of the letter, which brings together what we are proposing to our European partners as the basis for a smooth negotiation process.  My Prime Minister has set the UK's guiding principles.  The UK's unique relationship with Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland comprise one of those principles.  If I may, I will set out some of those principles before returning to discuss Ireland, which is, I am sure, one of our main interests here today.<br\/><br\/>First, in withdrawing from the EU, our overarching commitment is to ensuring that Europe remains strong and prosperous, capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from threats.  Through a new deep and special partnership, we want the UK to play its part in achieving these goals, and I hope that members will agree that such a partnership is in all our interests, including Ireland's.<br\/><br\/>On trade, we want to work towards securing a comprehensive agreement, taking into account both economic and security co-operation.  We propose a bold and ambitious free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  Given the scale of bilateral trade, running at over &euro;1 billion per week and employing more than 400,000 people, in addition to the strong trading relationships we enjoy with other EU member states, we believe that such an agreement would be in the best interests of Ireland and of all our EU partners.<br\/><br\/>Crucially, we also want to work together to minimise disruption and to give as much certainty as possible.  In particular, the Prime Minister placed great importance on putting all our citizens first, in the UK and EU, and aiming to strike an early agreement on their rights.  We are clear that providing certainty is in the best interest of our citizens, as well as our businesses and investors, in all of our countries.  I have heard that message loud and clear right across Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We recognise that two years is not a long time to reach a comprehensive settlement.  We start, however, from a position of close regulatory alignment, trust in each other's institutions and a spirit of co-operation stretching back decades.  Therefore, we believe that a comprehensive agreement can be agreed in the time period set out in the treaty.  Let me emphasise here that we will approach these negotiations constructively and respectfully.  It is in the interests of the UK and the EU that our exit be as smooth and orderly as possible.<br\/><br\/>The UK Government starts from a clear position of what is at stake for Ireland.  As members know, the Prime Minister's letter sets out &ndash; I quote in full &ndash; that:<\/p><blockquote>The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom.  <font color=\"#00201F\">We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland.  We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.<\/font><\/blockquote><p>When they met here at Government Buildings in January, the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach confirmed their support for a \"seamless, frictionless Border\" and the continuation of the common travel area.  This is now reflected firmly in our negotiating principles.  Both then and last week, the British Prime Minister reaffirmed her personal commitment to strengthening this significant and crucial relationship as the UK leaves the European Union, EU.  At every level of government, we are committed to ensuring this relationship continues to prosper.  Of course, both our Governments remain committed to upholding the Belfast Agreement and its institutions.  It is vital that devolved government and all of the institutions under the successive agreements are returned and operate in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.  The British Government&rsquo;s unrelenting focus is on achieving that objective.<\/p><p> The UK and Ireland enjoy a special and unique relationship.  It is testament to the importance of the relationship that the Taoiseach was the first foreign leader to visit Prime Minister May in Downing Street.  Since then, there has been consistent high-level ministerial engagement.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister have all visited Dublin in the past six months.  Our existing contacts at official level continue; last September we hosted in London the annual summit of Irish Secretaries General and UK Permanent Secretaries, which is again another unique and important facet of our bilateral co-operation.  Of course, there has been regular and close co-operation between parliamentarians.  We have received delegations from the House of Lords European Union committee, the House of Commons Select Committee on Exiting the European Union, a delegation from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs.  A delegation of UK parliamentarians also came to Dublin for a very successful CHAMP event with a focus on peace and reconciliation.  I know that many committee members engaged enthusiastically with these delegations.<\/p><p> I am also aware that many Oireachtas Members are regular visitors to Westminster and I am very keen to encourage and facilitate as much co-operation as possible between our two Parliaments.  One of my main priorities since arriving in Ireland just over six months ago has been to speak to, and much more important, to listen to as many people as possible about the challenges and opportunities they see ahead.  I have attached particular importance to engaging with communities in the Border counties.  I have, for example, spoken to a Brexit forum in Monaghan alongside Ministers, Deputy Heather Humphreys and Deputy Michael Creed.  This visit also gave me the opportunity to hear first-hand about the problems, for example, that mushroom suppliers have been experiencing, as well as the forward-looking preparations that local businesses are taking to ensure they remain competitive.  Last month I was in Donegal where I had the opportunity to witness the excellent collaboration between the city and county councils of Donegal and Derry-Strabane.  The joint report published by these two councils sets out the opportunities and challenges faced by the north-west city region.  I am mindful of the many successful regional interdependencies, such as this these, which have developed in recent years.  On my travels, I have also seen the excellent collaboration between start-ups such as Dogpatch Labs here in Dublin, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer visited, and Ludgate in Skibbereen and its British counterparts.  I have every confidence in the creativity and energy of companies such as these and the private sector more broadly to make the most of every opportunity in the years ahead.<\/p><p> Before I hand over to the Chairman, let me reassure members that the UK is not turning its back on the world.  That could not be further from the truth.  We want to play our part in making sure Europe remains strong and prosperous, projecting its values and able to lead in the world.  On the world stage, the UK is playing and will continue to play a leading role, whether in the area of humanitarian assistance, the fight to end modern slavery and human trafficking or tackling climate change.<\/p><p> I hope I have given the committee a clear sense of the UK&rsquo;s position as it heads into these negotiations, especially as it relates to Ireland.  My job and that of my embassy team here is to work hard to promote and support our strong bilateral relationship and ensure that the shared concerns that both the UK and Ireland have for the future are taken into account.  As British Prime Minister Theresa May has said, the task ahead of us is momentous but not beyond us.  I now look forward to hearing from members.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

He has had a slightly lively first six months in his posting but the engagement we have had with him and his team at the embassy has been very positive up to now.  I will touch on three areas alluded to in the statement but which perhaps did not get much detail in the address.  I would appreciate it if the ambassador could expand a little on them.<\/p> <p>  The first relates to future bilateral ties.  In the context of Brexit, the Irish Government is limited and will have to negotiate as part of the bloc of the remaining 27 EU member states.  That is widely accepted.  However, we are fortunate we have excellent alternative bilateral institutions already in place, such as the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and council.  I said to the ambassador's counterpart in Irish Government circles that there is a major role for these institutions post-Brexit and we could really see the British-Irish Council increase its workload from two summits per year to 12.  That would replace the amount of ministerial contact that Ministers have at a European Council level.  What are the thoughts of the witness in that respect?<\/p> <p>  I will probably be the only person to raise the future of the Commonwealth but I will do it anyway.  How important is that institution to the UK with respect to possible economic and social ties?  A third issue is one about which I am very concerned, and this is shared by many people.  It has dominated the media in the UK up to the past couple of days, when Gibraltar seems to have taken over for whatever reason.  It is the so-called Brexit bill.  I have been back and forth to Brussels, as have my colleagues, so many times and we have had really good engagements, as the ambassador mentioned, with counterparts from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  I am worried there is an obsession about what has been called a Brexit bill or divorce payment.  This relates to agreements entered into in good faith that are binding until 2020 and which deliver a return.  Is there a chance the British Government might be prepared to park this obsession with a so-called amount that elements in the Houses of Parliament and more particularly in the media in the UK have focused on?  That would allow tangible negotiations on really important matters to take place in the first two years.  We should not allow all negotiations to fall apart because of people becoming obsessed with a figure of 60 billion, whether it is in sterling or euro.  The numbers are bouncing about and will ultimately be paid but they are not the big issue.  What is more important is what happens in the next 50 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#B00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador and thank him for engaging with us.  I know he met many of us in different capacities in his short time here and he is willing to engage with us.  He is very accessible and I appreciate he has gone to Monaghan and Donegal.  He has done his best to deal with the issue of Brexit, communicate the message of the British Government to us and listen to us and our concerns from an Irish perspective.<\/p><p> Article 50 has been triggered.  I think most of us would give a cautious welcome to page 5 of Prime Minister Theresa May's letter where she talks about the unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  She mentions the need to avoid a hard Border between our two countries and the need to maintain the common travel area.  She states that we should make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland.  She also states that nothing should be done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland and she speaks of the necessity to continue to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.  From an Irish perspective, I think we should also give a cautious welcome to the draft guidelines published by the European Council President which refer to the paramount importance of preserving the gains of our peace process and call for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid the creation of a hard Border.  There is also a reference, as the ambassador will know, to the existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the UK and Ireland.<\/p><p> With regard to the negotiations, I presume the ambassador would agree with us here in Ireland that the talks on the separation and the talks on the future relationship should run as close as possible in parallel because this would avoid uncertainty for Irish businesses and Irish citizens.  I am of the view that this is a matter on which we could agree.<\/p><p> I want to raise the issue of Gibraltar, which has been very much in the news in recent few days.  It would seem that Spain in particular has got some sort of a veto in regard to the negotiations and we in Ireland are beginning to wonder why we did not get a similar veto put into the guidelines.  I wonder what the ambassador thinks about how this has unfolded in the days following the publication of the guidelines.  That the final deal will be decided by qualified majority voting is a concern for us and I would be interested to hear the ambassador's view.<\/p><p> I presume the British Government is working hard on the implications of Brexit for the Good Friday Agreement.  For example, one issue is the position regarding the European Convention on Human Rights in view of the fact that there is talk that the UK will introduce a UK bill of rights to supersede that.  This would seem to be at odds with the Good Friday Agreement, in which the British Government is committed to complete incorporation into Northern Ireland law of the European Convention on Human Rights, with direct access to the courts.  There is worry in that regard, and that is just one issue arising out of the implications of Brexit for the Good Friday Agreement.  All of us would obviously want to preserve that Agreement and I wonder what in-depth work is being undertaken to ensure it survives.<\/p><p> Is the ambassador concerned about the break-up of the UK?  Obviously, Scotland is now talking about a new independence referendum and the issue of Irish unity does seem to have come back on the agenda here as a result of Brexit and for obvious reasons.  I wonder what the British Government feels about that.  Is the ambassador of the view that this independence movement is unstoppable because of the economic and considerations arising out of Brexit?  I would be interested to hear the views of the British Government on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#B00400","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador and thank him for his interesting address.  We all recognise the importance of the time that lies ahead.  I think we are all committed to ensuring that we use that time extremely well as we approach the decisions that have to be taken cautiously and with great care to ensure that we do not damage each other's future, the future of the European Union, the UK-Ireland relationship and the Northern Ireland peace process, on which we have already set out our priorities.  That is not just an emotional response; it is practical also.  The practicality of having a borderless island of Ireland in recent years has been an experience we did not have before and it has worked extremely well.  Trade on both parts of the island has progressed immeasurably, business people on both sides of the frontier have gained the benefits of that borderless island to which I refer.  There is more to come of much greater potential than has been seen before.  Later today, I go to one of our universities to talk on the same subject and, in the next week, we will have people from Northern Ireland addressing a similar debate.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, we should try to identity the issues in respect of we have something in common, both with the EU and with our colleagues in the UK, and emphasise them rather than emphasising the differences.  We know what the differences and difficulties are going to be.  We know that in future we will require a relationship between Ireland and the UK and between the UK and the EU, on which we will have a negotiating position from inside the EU.  If we identify and set aside the issues that are going to be most contentious and try to address the common areas for a start, we will make progress.  Nothing succeeds like success.  Progress will be achieved on the easier rather than on the more difficult issues and will allow us to show results.<\/p> <p>  We need to ensure we are not seen to intimidate any of the people of Northern Ireland or to coerce them into a situation that might seem to our advantage now.  It is to their advantage and our advantage to ensure that we progress as we have for the past number of years with that borderless island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I foresee difficulties arising in respect of the customs union and the common travel area.  This matter is not beyond resolution, however, and I think it can be done once the negotiators who have an interest in resolving the problems recognise that it is attainable.  Of course, people will raise various red flags in the next 12 months, identifying issues which may seem fundamental to many countries throughout the EU.  However, nobody in the EU should avail of this process in order to set aside the ideals on which the Union was first founded.  It would be a great tragedy if that were to happen and would be an even greater tragedy if it were to become acceptable among any of the EU member states, including Ireland, or in the UK.  We would then find ourselves sliding into an abyss of uncertainty, doubt and suspicion.  Things have an unfortunate habit of being triggered in such a way as to make life extremely difficult.  We do not want to go back to 1930s thinking, whereby nationalism came to the fore across Europe, and we all know what happened.<\/p> <p>  I hope that in the next number of months we will both be in a position to establish those points that we see as most important, to have them embedded in the detail of what will be agreed from here on and to allow the positive rather than the negative to prevail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#C00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador.  We all appreciate very much that he and Mr. Welsh would do nothing to harm the unique and special relationship between our two countries, as the Prime Minister put it in her letter.  As the UK is going to be outside the Union, it is very important, as some of my colleagues have said, that we do everything to strengthen and improve the ties between us.  We can do that in different ways.  The British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, is an obvious area that can be strengthened and it can meet more often, as can CHAMP, and there are other organisations.  That is important work which we must bear in mind and pay attention to.  Obviously, like the UK, we want to do nothing to damage the relationship.<\/p> <p>  Like others, I appreciate very much what the Prime Minister wrote in her letter to President Tusk.<\/p><p>However, is there a contradiction or a little problem in that the Prime Minister has said very definitely that the UK intends to leave the customs union and the Single Market?  There will have to be a little give and take in the negotiations because the Prime Minister in her letter states that the UK, like our good selves, does not want a return to a hard border, and we want to maintain the common travel area.  In other words, we want Britain to have whatever would be akin to the Single Market.  I do not know what one would call it, but that is what we want and what the UK wants.  I hope this can be resolved in the give and take of negotiation, as Deputy Durkan said.<\/p><p> I think we all now realise more than previously that the UK's exit from the EU may take somewhat longer than two years.  We must therefore envisage the transition period, during which, presumably, the UK will continue to be a full member of the EU and the Single Market.  However, this will all have to be maintained during negotiations and into the transition for however long it takes.  I would appreciate the ambassador's comments on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#C00300","speaker":"1420","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I call Senator Terry Leyden, who is our Vice Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#D00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I welcome H.E. Mr. Robin Barnett and Mr. Paul Welsh.  I have had the opportunity to meet H.E. Mr. Barnett before.  I think he was specially selected for his experience as an ambassador working in many other countries, coming at this crucial time for both the United Kingdom and Ireland.  He brings a great insight to his job and is a vital contact between us and the United Kingdom, so we are delighted he has attended our committee meeting today.<\/p> <p>  The unique relationship we have had with the UK since before the 1920s, and the agreement of the common travel area in 1923, was not changed by the agreement in the 1970s providing for the UK's and Ireland's simultaneous accession to the European Communities.  There was no change to the common travel area then and there cannot be any change to it arising from the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  This is why the Prime Minister's letter is so supportive of our position.  I will not repeat what my colleagues have said because we all agree that the relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland absolutely must remain strong, and Irish people working in the United Kingdom must be reassured of their position.<\/p> <p>  There has been a major increase in the number of people in Britain applying for Irish passports and, as H.E. Mr. Barnett knows, every citizen of Northern Ireland is entitled to an Irish passport.  The Irish population in the UK will certainly increase with all the numbers now applying.  In addition, many Irish people can have dual citizenship, as can many people with Irish backgrounds working in the United Kingdom whose parents were born before 1949.  Similar provisions apply in respect of those with Irish grandparents.  Quite a number of people may avail of Irish passports, which may give them that extra sense of security at this time.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey said, most worrying is that many people at the start of these discussions felt the final agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom would be reached unanimously by the 27 other countries of the EU but there now seems to be talk of a qualified majority.  This is a difficulty for Ireland more than any other country because of our unique position.  I am not sure where this discussion came from or why it is happening.  Spain could veto an agreement.  I always felt secure that if the agreement was not in the best interests of the United Kingdom and Ireland, it could be vetoed.  It is very important that there be a very close relationship between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Irish Government and that we ensure our concerns are raised at the negotiations between the Heads of State during their regular meetings.<\/p> <p>  A 488 km Border is a very long one, and it will not be possible to man a mighty number of roads along the Border.  It does not matter how Border controls are operated; some roads will not be covered.  The key is that the most convenient way for our exports to mainland Europe is through the United Kingdom, and the Channel Tunnel is vital in this regard, so we must ensure we have seamless transportation through Northern Ireland, into Britain and beyond to the European Union.  Otherwise, we will have to strengthen our ports in Wexford for direct exports to France.  These are all the issues that will come up.  However, the process is still at a very early stage, which is why it is very important that we carry on the dialogue and keep in touch.<\/p> <p>  A delegation of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am a member, went to the House of Commons and House of Lords recently.  We had tremendous meetings with Members of Parliament and Ministers there, and such dialogue is absolutely vital for us to know the exact nature of each other's concerns.  The UK has a friend in Ireland, even though it is part of the remaining 27 countries of the EU, and a country that has the deepest concern about the future of the United Kingdom and Ireland because the UK's interests are our interests as well.  We cannot have the whole farming industry in dire straits, which is what will happen if there are significant imports from South America or elsewhere.  We have many concerns and many worries, quite frankly.  We never really anticipated that this would happen, but it is happening now so we must deal with it constructively.  I hope we will come up with a good arrangement which suits the United Kingdom and Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#D00300","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The ambassador is very welcome.  I begin by offering my condolences, those of the committee, those of many of my constituents and those of others I have met to those affected by the attack on innocent civilians on Westminster Bridge.  We are all familiar with Portcullis House from going in and out of it.  I offer not only my condolences to those whose loved ones died, but also our hopes for speedy recoveries for all those who are recovering from injuries sustained in the attack.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that H.E. Mr. Barnett said he is listening.  He referred in particular to some of his trips to the Border communities, and the fact that he is listening is a very important message to send out from here.  However, my view of the British Government is that its Brexit plan to date clearly shows that it is not listening but is ignoring the views of the majority in the North of Ireland which voted, as H.E. Mr. Barnett knows, to remain within the EU.  He said the UK's Government's intention is to leave the Single Market and the customs union, and again, I think most people's views are that this will have a detrimental impact on the economy not only in the North, but also in the South of Ireland and the people in both areas.  We argue that the British Government has no mandate to do this.  The people of the North clearly voted in the referendum to remain in the EU but it is almost as if the vote is being disregarded or discarded as not as important as other votes.  The people of Scotland would probably have a similar view in this regard.  That the UK is treating people in the North as less important - some would say as second-class citizens - is infuriating a huge number of people.  In the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, much time was spent on consent, the difficulty trying to agree the wording, getting agreement from all the parties and so on.  Now we see the consent of the people of the North being disregarded.  It is regrettable that the British Government has adopted this position.<\/p> <p>  The last thing a society coming out of conflict needs is more fear and uncertainty and increased tension.  No matter what one's position is, I think everyone accepts that that is where Brexit is leading us.  I am conscious that H.E. Mr. Barnett is a diplomat and may not be able to answer some of these questions but perhaps he can give us some insight into some of my comments.<\/p><p>Does the ambassador agree that Brexit poses a severe threat?  Does he agree it will undermine the institutional, constitutional and legal integrity of the Good Friday Agreement?  The agreement is the foundation of the Irish peace process and defines the relationship within and between Ireland and Britain.  Does he agree that in order to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and Irish-British relations that the North should receive special status within the EU?  This House adopted the view that a special status would be a positive and workable solution and made the suggestion.  I am sure everyone will agree that the North needs a special arrangement.  Even the Unionists have talked about having a special arrangement.  Has the British Government considered the option?  Will it consider the option?<\/p><p> The majority of the MLAs who were recently elected to the Assembly believe that a realistic alternative must be found for the North.  Theresa May has talked about having a seamless and frictionless border.  It is obvious that a hard economic border will be imposed on the island of Ireland but it is unworkable because we have 277 roads and 500 km of territory.  I do not know how the British will impose a border when it leaves the customs union and the Single Market.<\/p><p> Other speakers have raised the issue of Gibraltar.  Many people in Ireland have been shocked by remarks made about Gibraltar because there was a sniff of gunpowder about them.  Lord Michael Howard stated that the British Government was willing to go to war with Spain over Gibraltar.  I ask the ambassador to comment on Lord Howard's remarks.  Interestingly, Gibraltar was not mentioned in the draft European Council guidelines but it was mentioned in Prime Minister May's letter last week to the EU to trigger Article 50.  Can the ambassador provide an insight into why the Prime Minister did not mention Gibraltar in her letter considering the strong feelings expressed by a former Tory leader?  My colleagues and I heard similar worries and concerns when we attended BIPA meetings.  We were addressed by people from Gibraltar who expressed their difficulties with the situation.  Again, I am conscious that the population of Gibraltar voted by a majority of 96% in favour of remaining in the EU but that democratic vote was ignored.  <\/p><p> Prime Minister May has repeatedly ruled out Britain remaining in the Single Market or the customs union primarily due to an irrational fear of free movement within the EU.  Can the ambassador give an insight into his Government's plans for a trade agreement with the EU?  Will it be an agreement at all costs?  People have expressed their concerns about having a default World Trade Organization.  We are trying to pick up all of the signals and listen to what people are saying.  Phillip Hammond has said that he personally hopes Britain can remain part of mainstream European economic and social thinking and the ambassador said much the same in his speech.  If Ireland is forced to do something different then we will do so.  Mr. Hammond mentioned options, including cutting corporation tax, to regain competitiveness.  Jeremy Corbyn shared his concern when he stated that he feared the British Government was attempting to establish itself as a low tax haven.  Many people we talked to in Europe have expressed their concerns that the North of Ireland will be used as a dumping ground for cheap food, goods, etc.  Can the ambassador give us an insight into the British Government's plan in terms of this matter?<\/p><p> The British Government has committed to scrapping the Human Rights Act  I have been told that the plans are on hold to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the European Convention on Human Rights.  These matters are separate from the Brexit negotiations but run parallel with them.  These matters have created a great amount of concern.  The Human Rights Act is one of the pillars of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.  Many of us believe that repealing these matters would be a direct violation of the agreements.  We have been told that these matters are under review.  Can the ambassador give us an insight into when the British Government plans to repeal the Human Rights Act?  We view such a measure as violating the peace agreement.<\/p><p> Last week, the Scottish Government voted in favour of holding a second referendum and the First Minister of Scotland, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, has written to Prime Minister May formally requesting that.  Scotland voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU yet the country is being dragged out of the EU against its will, according to First Minister Sturgeon, without an influence or input into negotiations as all power is being centralised in London.  Considering all of that and the democratic vote by the Scottish Parliament, will the British Government facilitate a second independence referendum in Scotland before it is forced out of the EU by a Government that the Scottish people clearly did not vote for?<\/p><p> I have major concerns about the impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I hope the ambassador can answer my questions.  The view is that Brexit was triggered without an understanding or concern about the impact it would have on Ireland, particularly the peace process.  I am disappointed that the peace process and situation in the North did not feature in the campaign to leave the EU.  There is a large proportion of people on this island who feel that Brexit will be disastrous for Ireland.  The negative impact did not feature in the referendum campaign.  We hope that the relationship between Ireland and Britain continues.  Current negotiations will have an impact on the future relationship between both countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#D00400","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend today.  As a member and Vice Chairman of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, it was good to hear the ambassador's and the Chairman's opinions on trying to assimilate views on the issue.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the ambassador's bona fides and appreciate his accessibility in terms of discussing this issue.  Today is not the first time that we have met and engaged in a discussion.  Other members have made a similar comment. <\/p> <p>  From the point of view of Twenty-six Counties, all of the sectors have prepared a paper on the impact of Brexit.  The ambassador mentioned in his presentation that he attended the Ceann Comhairle's Brexit meeting in the Mansion House and I attended the same meeting.  Many of us attended the two civil dialogue or break-out meetings on the various sectors.  I have no doubt that we in Ireland have identified an awful lot of the problems but I am not sure that the UK has fully realised the problems with Brexit.  I ask the ambassador to comment on the matter in his concluding remarks.  <\/p> <p>   I understand diplomacy and talking a great deal but now it is time to find solutions.  The process to date is like a poker game.  People have kept their cards close to their chests in an effort to get the best outcome for England and Ireland.  Indeed, everyone wants a slice of the cake and to get the best outcome for their country.  The only clear message that I have gathered from the toing and froing is that the EU has said it has asked the UK and Irish Governments to come up with what the EU has described as unique and imaginative solutions that are compatible to the remaining EU members.<\/p><p>I have already said that where a vacuum is created, space is provided for those who want to fill that vacuum for their own gains.  I am deeply concerned about that as someone who has lived along the Border and been involved in politics for 25 years.  Can the ambassador give me examples of where there is common ground in terms of unique and imaginative solutions?  I will speak briefly about one area to which Deputy Crowe and others have already referred, namely, the importance of the agricultural industry.  Regardless of the outcome, the protection of our green image in agricultural terms in two different jurisdictions would require a magic wand.  It is my view that there must be a special solution on a 32 county basis for that issue alone, not to mention the other sectors.  I ask the ambassador to give his honest opinion on a solution because I have heard absolutely no solution from the British side on any issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#E00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Breathnach.

The British Supreme Court's ruling on Article 50 found that Westminster is in charge and that there is no requirement for engagement with any of the devolved governments with respect to its triggering.  The Good Friday Agreement is of particular concern because, apart from the fact that it is an international agreement underpinned by the British and Irish Governments and the European Union, it has been suggested that legislation will be required in the UK to solidify that agreement under the new arrangements.  Has anything been done about that?<\/p> <p>  I sometimes get a little worried when I meet MPs from Westminster or members of the House of Lords who argue that Britain is leaving the club but is not exactly leaving the playing pitch.  One is either in the club or out of it.  In my view, the UK has left the club and has left all of the benefits and some of the costs of membership of that club behind.  The ambassador spoke about putting citizens first but some British politicians, who have now jumped ship since the referendum, certainly did not put the citizens first in pushing the country towards Brexit.  I am particularly concerned about Northern Ireland, where there is no Assembly in place at the moment.  We now have civil servants running the North of Ireland on reduced budgets, I might add.  Given the likelihood of a failure to put an Assembly in place by Easter, it strikes me that the civil servants will be playing a role for a considerable period of time to come, at least until another election is held and negotiations take place.  Who is going to take political responsibility for Northern Ireland, to ensure that it suffers no more and no less than any other part of the United Kingdom?  <\/p> <p>  A question has been asked of me - and I would have to declare some interest in it myself - regarding entitlements to pensions from the UK and to other services for people who served or worked in the UK.  How does the ambassador see that working?  Such entitlements are very integrated under the European Union but outside of that, will that continue on?  It has been part of the Irish, British relationship for generations.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of the Border, I cannot see any way that a third country outside of the European Union cannot have a border with Ireland.  I know that the Prime Minister, Ms May and our own Taoiseach have expressed the desire that we have a border-less relationship but I cannot see a way.  The ambassador has been in the diplomatic corps for a long time but I cannot see how one country can sit alongside another and not have a border in place.  I see the problem of the free movement of people as one that can be dealt with relatively easily but not so for the movement of goods.  Everyone accepts that we need to have a border-less relationship with Northern Ireland but nobody has come up with a solution or an idea as to how that can be achieved.  I do not expect the ambassador to outline an idea today but I am wondering if there is somebody in Westminster, Northern Ireland or somewhere in the UK trying to find a solution that will be acceptable to the UK, the citizens of Northern Ireland who wish to be regarded as UK citizens only and the European Union.  Whatever the idea, it cannot create a precedent for other countries to try to dovetail into for their own specific reasons.  I am thinking here of places like Gibraltar, Cyprus and Catalonia, for example.  That is an issue of concern.<\/p> <p>  There was another issue that I wished to raise but I am afraid I have lost my train of thought.  I will leave it at that for the moment but if it comes back to me, I will revert to the ambassador.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#F00500","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1491303600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I now call Senator Mark Daly who is a member of Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, as are Senators Breathnach and Craughwell.

I asked him a question there which he did not answer so I will put it to him again here.  Our Taoiseach has said that the EU needs to prepare for a united Ireland.

I thank the members for a very comprehensive range of questions.  I will do my best to answer as many as I can but members will appreciate that some of the more technical questions will, inevitably, be outside my immediate range of expertise.<\/p><p>I am very confident of one thing, namely, that we will be continuing this dialogue in the future.<\/p><p> Let me do my best to respond to some of the issues which have been raised.  I will begin by reminding members of what the Prime Minister wrote.  We are looking for \"a deep and special partnership\" that takes in both security and economic co-operation, with a \"bold and ambitious\" free trade agreement, greater in scope than any such agreement before.  We want to work towards a comprehensive agreement with \"a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing EU member state,\" and to \"agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\"  In respect of implementation periods, as we move to the new relationship we want to minimise disruption from any suggestion of a \"cliff-edge.\"  It is very much in that context that I would like to try to answer some of the specific points that have been put.  <\/p><p> In different ways, the issue of bilateral institutions has been raised.  I stress that we in the UK attach great importance to continuing to strengthen bilateral institutions and contacts.  We are in complete agreement about the importance of parliamentary contacts at all levels.  I have spoken about this on a number of occasions.  I agree that we need to look at all the existing institutions and make sure that they meet the needs of our future relationships.  A priority for me, too, is to continue to ensure that there is good engagement between parliamentary committees here and in the UK on issues of general interest, in other words, the broad range of parliamentary business in which the Houses of the Oireachtas and both Houses of the UK Parliament engage.  That will be an area of great importance in the future.  <\/p><p> As I already stated, the annual meeting of Secretaries General and permanent undersecretaries is an incredibly important institution.  We will want to make sure that we maintain a strong level of contact between officials.  The flow of ministerial visits since I arrived here is an indication of the political importance we attach to the bilateral relationship, and I can confirm that there will be plenty more such visits in the pipeline in both directions.  I can definitely confirm our interest in making sure that we have strong and effective engagement going forward.<\/p><p> Senator Richmond mentioned the importance of the Commonwealth for the UK.  I can absolutely confirm that.  We will continue to see the Commonwealth as a very important institution.  It has done a lot of good work since its foundation in every conceivable area, from economics through education and culture, as well as work in the field of human rights.<\/p><p> In response to the questions that several honourable members put regarding how the talks should be conducted, this is, of course, the opening of a negotiation.  Such matters will need to be agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  As my Prime Minister pointed out in the Article 50 letter, our strong view is that the talks on leaving the European Union should be conducted alongside the negotiations on a new deep and special partnership.  We think that this is firmly in the best interests of the EU, the UK and Ireland for all the reasons that many members have adduced, namely, the importance of clarity and of certainty for the future.<\/p><p> Let me turn to questions around the Border.  It is clear that the common travel area, which predates our and Ireland's membership of the European Union, is the way forward in terms of ensuring free movement of people.  In terms of free movement of goods and related issues, while there are challenges, we firmly believe that the basis for an effective way forward is a bold and ambitious free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.  To those who say that this may be hard to achieve within a timescale, I would respectfully observe that this is not about how to identify convergence or common standards; we are already starting from a shared place.  Many of the complications that people adduce about concluding a free trade agreement are not appropriate when we are starting from a position of equivalence.<\/p><p> A number of questions have been posed around the implications for the Northern Ireland peace process.  We are committed to implementing the Belfast Agreement and its successors.  Human rights protection for all in Northern Ireland is part of that and will continue to be.  In terms of the representation of the people of Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom Government will be negotiating on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom.  As the members will know, there are mechanisms in place to ensure that the views of the devolved administrations are taken into account into that process.  That is why a priority for our Government and for the Government of Ireland is to reinstate the Northern Ireland Executive as quickly as possible.  As the members will know, discussions on that process are continuing on an ongoing basis.  <\/p><p> In terms of the issues around the rights of citizens, I think my Prime Minister has been crystal clear.<\/p><p>This is an absolute top priority for my government.  We will continue to make it a top priority and we very much hope that we will be able to provide the certainty that is required as soon as possible.  I must, however, remind the committee that this will very much be a negotiation.  <\/p><p> In terms of references to Gibraltar, our focus in the forthcoming negotiations on Brexit is to ensure that we get the best possible deal in trade and other matters, and co-operation for the future for the UK and for Gibraltar.  We will be working closely with the Gibraltar Government as we have been over recent months.  We will continue to do that to ensure that we get a result that is in the interests of the United Kingdom, in the interests of Gibraltar and of the 27 member states of the European Union.  <\/p><p> I was asked whether people are focused on the specific problems of our bilateral relationship.  I give the committee a categorical assurance that they are.  The range of engagement between our two governments is a partial demonstration of that but I can assure the committee that as we prepare for the forthcoming negotiations there is a great deal of focus on the specific challenges, not least the issues that many Members of the Oireachtas have raised here today with respect to delivering a border that is as seamless and frictionless as possible.<\/p><p> There was a suggestion that we might need legislation to solidify the Good Friday Agreement.  This is an international agreement to which we remain 100% committed.  The committee may have seen a statement to that effect very recently by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.  In terms of the possibility of an eventual border poll the arrangements on that are spelled out extremely clearly in the Belfast Agreement.<\/p><p> There were several quite technical and detailed questions including around issues such as pensions.  Rather than attempt to give answers we will come back to the members, if we may, after we have had a chance to consult on some of these technical issues.  <\/p><p> Finally, I firmly believe that we will be able to achieve the deep and strong and special partnership with the EU that my Prime Minister has set out in the Article 50 letter.  In this process we are very mindful of the importance of our bilateral relationship with Ireland.  We are actively engaged in looking at creative solutions to problems and challenges, although some of those creative solutions will not just come from governments but from the talent that exists in our private sectors in Ireland and in the United Kingdom.  I would also like to stress that we are not just focused on the Article 50 negotiations.  As many members of the committee have indicated, there is a very strong economic partnership between our two countries.  That continues today.  We are actively looking for opportunities to strengthen that partnership in a range of areas, one good example being medtech but there are many more.  Our focus at the British Embassy in Dublin is not only on the work we need to do in respect of the Article 50 letter but also to identify ways, as many members have indicated, of strengthening our partnership for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017040400002#F01100","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I will focus on three topics in my introductory statement - the examination of tracker mortgages, the role of the Central Bank in supporting initiatives to reform the motor insurance market and Brexit.  I will address each of them in turn.<\/p> <p>  On the examination of issues related to tracker mortgages, I fully share the committee's concerns.  Where these issues have arisen, it is clear that lenders have failed their customers.  Moreover, I am acutely aware of the unacceptable impact these failures have had on tracker mortgage customers, ranging from the burden of having to pay more than they should to instances involving loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.  I acknowledge that committee members frequently deal with such cases in their constituencies and that the committee has heard powerful testimony about the effects these failures have had on individuals and families.  The Central Bank is also aware of many of these cases from callers to our public helpline and our ongoing engagement with various consumer representatives.  These are important sources of information which continue to inform the examination.  The Central Bank is pursuing a comprehensive, industry-wide examination precisely to ensure lenders will identify every affected customer, stop the harm and pay appropriate redress and compensation.<\/p> <p>  The fair treatment of tracker mortgage borrowers has been a key supervisory and policy focus for the Central Bank for the past few years.  In line with our mandate to ensure the best interests of consumers are protected, the Central Bank intervened with a number of lenders in the period 2008 to 2015 on a range of issues related to tracker mortgages.  The interventions ranged from lender-specific supervisory and enforcement actions to, more generally, strengthening the statutory protections for tracker mortgage customers, specifically through the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>During the period before the examination we dealt with a range of lender-specific issues, resulting in approximately 7,100 customer accounts affected by various tracker issues being resolved prior to the beginning of the current examination.  We also intervened in a number of additional cases on a preventative basis to prevent detriment to tracker customers before it occurred.  Other issues were being actively investigated at the time of the commencement of the examination and these are now being dealt with as part of the examination or, where necessary, have been escalated for enforcement action.<\/p><p> Where appropriate, the Central Bank has required certain lenders to offer affected customers the right to return to a tracker rate and-or payment of redress and compensation.  The Central Bank has also commenced enforcement investigations into tracker-related measures at Permanent TSB and its subsidiary, Springboard Mortgages.  As a result, these lenders were required to implement a comprehensive mortgage redress programme to address the issues identified.  Although the underlying characteristics of each issue have differed, the Central Bank, taking all of this evidence together, decided to launch a system wide examination in 2015 given the range and nature of the customer impact of the issues identified.  The examination's scope requires a robust review to identify and deliver fair outcomes for all other affected customers in addition to those cases known to the Central Bank prior to the start of the examination.<\/p><p> The tracker examination is the largest, most complex and significant supervisory review the Central Bank has undertaken to date in respect of its consumer protection mandate.  It has involved an initial review of the total mortgage book by lenders in the relevant period, which amounts to more than 2 million accounts.  In line with our commitment given at the start of the examination, we have been publishing regular status updates in respect of this ongoing and current supervisory work.  The most recent was published last month and has been provided to the committee.  The aim of the examination is to ensure that all relevant lenders conduct a comprehensive and robust review which delivers fair outcomes for all customers.  I note that a number of lenders have recently apologised to the customers where they failed.  Our view is quite clear that this does not have a material meaning unless the lender both stops the harm to all affected customers and provides appropriate redress and compensation for the suffering caused.  Lenders must now demonstrate that they are doing everything possible to ensure this happens.  This is our goal in overseeing the examination.<\/p><p> The way the framework has been put in place is intended to provide appropriate redress and compensation to affected customers.  One of the quality assurance steps in this process is that each lender has had to appoint an external, independent party to oversee the conduct of its lender-specific examination.  The framework of the examination is in phases.  Phase one involved the development and submission of detailed plans by relevant lenders, which is completed.  Phase two requires lenders to conduct the review of their books in line with our framework.  These reviews are extensive in that lenders must review the underlying loan documentation and customer files for the in-scope accounts to determine the specific contractual obligations and also to determine more broadly if the documentation that each customer received had the potential to confuse or mislead the customer both on a stand alone basis and also when read in conjunction with other communications, written or verbal, made to the individual customer.<\/p><p> In this respect the Central Bank invoked its powers under section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to set specific deadlines for each lender to complete phase two of the examination.  The last of these deadlines is the end of September 2017.  The timelines have varied in line with the size of the relevant lender's loan book, the scale and complexity of issues raised in each lender and the complexities associated with completing a thorough review in line with the objectives of the examination.  By the end of next September, the Central Bank expects all lenders to have identified all affected accounts, stopped further harm and to have commenced engagement with most impacted customers.  The Central Bank is rigorously monitoring the completion of this work.<\/p><p> Phase three of the examination relates to calculating redress and compensation for customers identified as having been affected by tracker-related issues.<\/p><p>Phase four relates to implementation of a redress and compensation scheme.  It is important to appreciate that phases three and four, dealing with redress and compensation, can run concurrently with phase two.  We expect lenders to initiate phases three and four once affected customers are identified.  There is no need to complete phase two in its entirety before moving to redress and compensation for cohorts already identified.  In that regard, thus far under the examination, around &euro;78 million has been paid out in redress and compensation to approximately 2,200 affected customers.  <\/p><p> Separately, in regard to the mortgage redress programme for PTSB and Springboard Mortgages that was announced prior to the examination, additional redress and compensation amounts were paid.  PTSB paid &euro;36.8 million and its subsidiary, Springboard, paid &euro;5.8 million.  Due to legal requirements which restricted the degree to which I can discuss individual firms, I cannot provide a detailed lender-by-lender breakdown of payout of redress and compensation.  We are detailing aggregate amounts and there are tables with the available data in the statement I have provided to the committee.  <\/p><p> I emphasise the Central Bank does not have the statutory power to compel lenders to implement redress and compensation in respect of failures that occurred prior to the 2013 Act.  Having sought such powers, we were granted them in the 2013 Act but they are not retrospective.  However, I believe the Central Bank's robust approach in this matter is evident from the principles of redress we have laid down and published and with which we expect lenders to comply.  To illustrate our robust approach, it is important to emphasise that this work is not just being conducted by our consumer protection directorate but also our separate enforcement directorate which is involved in the exam.  Where regulatory breaches are suspected, cases may be referred to enforcement.  We are committed to taking robust enforcement action aimed at promoting principled and ethical behaviour by and within regulated entities.  To date, the Central Bank has concluded an enforcement investigation in regard to Springboard and imposed a monetary penalty of &euro;4.5 million on that entity in respect of these failures, which is the highest penalty ever collected by the Central Bank.  This is on top of the direct payout to the affected customers.  <\/p><p> In addition to the investigation into the tracker issues at Springboard and Permanent TSB, the Central Bank has initiated an enforcement investigation at Ulster Bank.  We may also commence other investigations as appropriate into other lenders and persons concerned in the management of such entities where there is evidence of non-compliance with regulatory requirements.  In this regard, enforcement activity will be influenced by the outcome of the reviews currently being conducted as part of the tracker examination.  In short, all possible enforcement angles, including potential individual culpability, will be thoroughly investigated and analysed in the context of the legal framework.  Enforcement measures will be deployed as appropriate, including investigating issues and taking cases under our administrative sanctions procedure, together with the use of our fitness and probity powers.  Boards of lending institutions are expected to ensure appropriate control, governance and management in those firms.  <\/p><p> In line with international regulatory standards, we operate a risk-based framework for the supervision of regulated firms.  In its regular supervisory work, the Central Bank cannot pre-approve every single commercial decision taken or contract entered into by a regulated firm.  Rather, supervision entails challenge of firms, judgment of the risks they pose to the economy and to the consumer and mitigation of those risks we judge to be unacceptable.  Targeted enforcement action against those firms whose poor behaviour risks jeopardising our objectives, including financial stability and consumer protection, underpins this framework.  Consumers are further protected by other relevant State bodies in this area such as the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the courts system.  Taken together, these form the State's protection for individuals.  <\/p><p> I recognise and acknowledge the committee's reflection that the examination has taken some time and that it will take some further time to complete.<\/p><p>I reiterate that lenders are working to the specific timelines we have imposed and are required to examine all relevant individual contracts.  Given the harm the actions of some of these lenders have caused, it is essential the examinations be both comprehensive and robust.  Our objective is to ensure that every impacted customer is identified and appropriately redressed and compensated.<\/p><p> The Central Bank welcomes the focus that this committee and the cost of insurance working group led by Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy has brought to bear on the issue of motor insurance.  The Central Bank appeared before this committee in regard to insurance last year.  The Central Bank recognises that volatility in the price of insurance has an unwelcome impact on consumers.  We do not have a role in the setting of premiums, in common with all supervisory authorities across the EU.  It is explicitly prohibited by European law under Article 181 of the Solvency II directive.  The Central Bank is committed to working with this committee, the cost of insurance working group and other stakeholders on aspects related to this issue in ways that are appropriate to our mandate.<\/p><p> There were a number of common themes between the findings of this committee's final report and the work of the cost of insurance working group in which we were involved.  For example, both found there was scope to improve the renewal process to assist consumers in the purchase of insurance.  Equally, both the committee and the working group recommended substantive work be undertaken to improve data availability.  The Central Bank, through the working group process, is the lead owner for a number of recommendations and actions in these areas.  Work has begun on implementation.  In the area of renewals, the working group recommended that insurers provide additional information on the premium breakdown to consumers and that the renewal notification period be extended from 15 to 20 working days to make it easier for motorists to compare pricing when purchasing insurance.  The requirements for provision of information in non-life renewal notices are set out in the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007.  The process to amend these regulations requires us to undertake a standard consultation process including engagement with consumers, stakeholders and industry.  The consultation will be conducted in the fourth quarters of 2017 in line with the timeframe set out by the working group.  Regulatory change, if required, will take place in 2018.<\/p><p> In the area of data availability, the working group has recommended the establishment of a national claims information database.  We are currently working with the Department of Finance and other stakeholders to define key aggregated statistical data on motor claims for publication in the near future.  This will assist with the development of the database in 2018 as recommended.  It should be noted, however, that the database function will represent an extension of our mandate and will require legislative change.<\/p><p> As I said at the outset, the Central Bank is committed to working with this committee, the Department of Finance, the cost of insurance working group and other stakeholders on this issue in ways that are appropriate to our mandate.<\/p><p> Brexit is a priority area for the Central Bank, dealing with the implications both for the wider economy and for the financial system.  Our current near-term forecasts are for relatively favourable growth in the economy, driven by continuing recovery in underlying domestic demand.  Consumption and the domestic-driven component of investment is set to remain robust and is supported by a strong labour market.  However, there is no doubt that the outlook remains subject to unusual uncertainty related to external risks, including Brexit and the uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit trading relationship.<\/p><p> Last week, the UK Government triggered Article 50 of the treaty, starting the two-year negotiation period.  In fact, the European Commission has indicated that an agreement would need to be completed by October 2018 to allow ratification by the UK and European Parliaments before the two-year timeframe elapses.  It is clear that this timeframe is very ambitious, given the volume of issues that must be negotiated.  It can be extended if all member states agree.<\/p><p> For the domestic banking sector, Brexit to date has had a relatively benign impact.  We have not seen any funding impact or decline in credit quality.  We continue to engage with all regulated entities to ensure they are adequately prepared.<\/p><p>It is too early to accurately predict any Brexit-related effect on foreign direct investment.  In the financial sector we have had increased engagement with a range of entities, including banks, market and insurance firms, and queries about payments and electronic transfers.  The inquiries have taken the form of discussions on potential new authorisations and possible balance sheet expansions by existing firms or changes to business type.  Where the Central Bank is asked to consider the authorisation of a firm in Ireland, we will want to be satisfied that we are authorising a business or a line of business that will be run from Ireland and which we, effectively, will be supervising.  The Central Bank will expect it to have a substantive presence here.  For financial services, it operates under a common framework for regulation and supervision at a European level.  This is all part of the European System of Financial Supervision, ESFS, which promotes the consistent application of EU legislative requirements.<\/p><p> Potential new entrants pose a challenge to us as an organisation in planning and prioritisation, but we are meeting this challenge.  To fulfil our mandate in safeguarding stability, using a risk-based approach to supervising credit institutions and ensuring a robust and transparent authorisation and approval process, we established a Brexit task force within the Central Bank prior to the referendum.  This internal task force has a cross-departmental structure involving 15 divisions across the Central Bank.  This functional approach is necessary, given the potential for a more diverse cross-section of entity types and new business models across all sectors.  We have increased our capacity to deal with this and are developing our contingency resourcing plans.<\/p><p> Our vision is to have a well functioning, well managed and well regulated financial system.  Legacies of the past remain material and continue to be worked through.  Trust in the system remains very damaged, which reflects the need for continued improvements, including in the underlying culture of financial firms.  We endeavour to foster a strong culture of compliance, with firms and individuals within firms acting in the best interests of their customers, backed up by comprehensive and enforceable legislation, rigorous supervision, a credible threat of enforcement and powers of redress when customers have suffered detriment.  As I stated, although the examination of tracker mortgages will still take some time, the Central Bank's goal is to ensure every customer who has been impacted on will be identified and appropriately redressed and compensated.<\/p><p> In looking ahead, Brexit poses a number of risks and challenges for the economy, individual institutions and businesses.  In line with our mandate, we will continue to highlight these risks, engage with the regulated institutions in order that they will be adequately prepared and provide a transparent and efficient authorisation process for potential entities that choose to establish in Ireland.  Equally, on the issue of insurance, the Central Bank will continue to work with the committee, the working group and other stakeholders in ways appropriate to our mandate.  I look forward to discussing these issues further with the committee, as well as the others raised in the invitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017040400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491296400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I welcome the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Lane, and his colleagues.

Is the Central Bank concerned by what we are witnessing in respect of new house prices?  What are Professor Lane's views now in respect of the help-to-buy scheme?

Of most concern is a scenario where it persists.<\/p><p>It is one issue where, in a given period, if there is a surge for some reason, it then self-corrects.  Of course, we do not need to go through all of the supply issues which are relevant to this.  It is also important to emphasise that, in an economy that is doing very well at the moment in terms of a strong labour market and so on, there is going to be some degree of reasonable house price increase.  Let me emphasise, however, that the contribution of our rules is that the dynamic has self-correcting features.  The strongest one is the anchor that mortgages cannot be offered beyond 3.5 times a person's income.  Therefore mortgages cannot detach from income levels because of that rule.  The second feature is the percentage deposit requirement.  It is 10% for first-time buyers, 20% for second-time buyers and 30% for buy-to-let.  As house prices go up, those deposit requirements become more demanding, and that is a self-correcting feature.<\/p><p> As regards the help-to-buy scheme, when asked last year, I said that one could make the case that there might be some gains to boost supply by easing the ability of new home builders to access finance.  Of course, in the short term that takes time to kick in with a demand effect.  <\/p><p> The second point, which is ultimately for the political system, is the distribution element.

The real fear is that we will see that happening in the second and third quarters also.  The construction industry did not suggest that that was what the help-to-buy scheme was about.  Indeed the Government did not suggest that either.  It suggested, and continues to suggest, that it is about trying to ensure people can gather the necessary deposits.<\/p> <p>  Data released to me by the Minister for Finance show that 74% of people who have been approved under the help-to-buy scheme had over the 10% deposit required.  Some of them had a 30% deposit and took out a 70% loan-to-value ratio mortgage.  There is no clarity on whether the 24% or 25% of people who had a 10% deposit actually required up to &euro;20,000 from the help-to-buy scheme.

It is the conundrum of whether one is able to target those who need a subsidy or, if one sets out a rule, whether it will include many more people who already have a capacity to meet our deposit requirements.<\/p><p>That is an inevitability of all subsidy schemes.

I must emphasise this is not about affordability.  What is happening now is that it is only people on relatively good incomes who can buy a house.  It is not a statement to say that the average house price will connect to the average income level.  The mortgage market is only one slice of all of the issues the political system is debating such as affordability and ways for people to achieve a home.  At least through the end of 2016, we have seen mortgages have not gone above the 3.5 times income level.

Around the world there are all sorts of different institutional arrangements but let me emphasise that there are a lot of advantages to having consumer protection within the Central Bank.  It is important to emphasise that there is no hierarchy in the legislation.  It is not the case that consumer protection ranks below financial stability.  These are twin mandates that we have.  I remind the Deputy that our financial regulation activity is funded by fees collected from the industry and that there is not a resource constraint here.  If we deem it necessary to expand our personnel to deliver consumer protection, by and large that cost will fall on the industry; it will not fall on the taxpayer.  We have advocated throughout that the cost should be fully paid for by the industry.<\/p> <p>  An advantage of consumer protection within the bank is that we learn a great deal from being the overall supervisor.  Around the world, stand-alone consumer protection commissions have a difficulty because they do not have the same access to information that we have.  I would think that it is in the best interests of consumers that we have that twin power.  It is quite effective.  We have done a lot that is at the intersection of supervision and consumer protection.  Our codes have been, unusually in the international context, prescriptive in how financial institutions deal with consumers.  There is always an uphill struggle to do more and do better, but it is not an issue of resources or of any conflict within the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017040400002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1491296400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>On the issue of criminal prosecution, to which reference is made in the comprehensive review to which I referred earlier, there are specific powers in respect of the bank's obligations under section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.

They might say that it was within the terms of the contract, that they interpret the contract to mean they could do that.  There is a common economic incentive to do that.

The Governor stated last November, when the Central Bank took away the limit, that if there was a material change then the bank would make changes to the rules.  Now, the Governor is saying that the bank will look at it every November.  November is eight months away.  That is too long.  It seems strange that the Central Bank went from having a limit to no limit at all.  Is that a contributory factor in the increase in the price of houses?<\/p> <p>  What does the Governor regard as a material increase in the price of houses?  At what point will the Governor seek to bring some sort of control over the increase in the price of houses?  November is eight months away.  If house prices continue to spiral at the rate they are going, it will put the value of the average home beyond the ordinary person.<\/p> <p>  I always look at it in simplistic terms.  Can the average couple afford to buy a home?  If they cannot afford to buy a home, then we have a dysfunctional system.  The Governor referred to stability.  Stability is not a macro issue; it is about something else.  We saw a couple on an RTE programme last night.  They bought a one-bedroom apartment during the Celtic tiger because they were told that was the only way to get on the property ladder.<\/p><p>They have a family and they have to move out of that one-bedroom apartment.  The loan is in negative equity and is a millstone around their necks.  They are renting elsewhere.<\/p><p> They are not first-time buyers curtailed by Central Bank restrictions.  However, let us consider the first-time buyers who are renting, who are in their 30s and approaching 40 years of age.  Such people are wondering whether they will ever qualify for a mortgage or buy a family home.  I am asking a question.  By lifting that limit, is it possible that the Central Bank may be contributing to depriving these people from buying homes that they can afford?<\/p><p> At what point will the Governor consider that a material change in price has taken place, considering we have seen a 4.3% increase in the first three months of this year?  At what point will the Central Bank step in and make the changes to ensure that an ordinary person, who is making a living in an ordinary job, can afford to buy a first-time buyer home?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017040400002#S00500","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491296400,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Senator O'Donnell has raised several issues.

For people on typical incomes to be able to afford a reasonable home, the answer is all about expanding housing supply.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Donnell pointed out the specific change in our rules that might affect a house costing &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000.  The change is rather small because it is only at the margin above &euro;220,000 where the extra deposit was required.  This is not a major change, especially in the context of a large fraction of people in that neighbourhood securing exemptions from the old rule.  The old rule was complicated and had a wide exemption.  Now, we have a new rule that is simpler.  The borrowing limit is 90% but there are few exceptions.  Only 5% of first-time buyers can get an exemption from that rule.  Therefore, it is not the case that it is a material change that is driving the housing market.  It is a simplification.<\/p> <p>  I repeat that the anchor of the system is a limit of three and a half times income.

This is why the loan-to-income ratio is fundamental.  Incomes cannot spiral upwards, therefore mortgage levels cannot spiral upwards in this context.  That is why there is a limit.  With the loan-to-value ratio and the deposit requirements, again people's deposits cannot spiral upwards.  They have to save those deposits, so it is impossible to have that spiral in the same way.  A degree of predictability is needed in our rules, and this is why a once a year review is good way to do it.

On the subject on which we have just had an exchange, it is not an issue about the Governor writing a speech or a report stating that the Central Bank of Ireland is concerned.  One needs tools.  We are using two instruments, first, a set of mortgage rules and second, a capital buffer so that if we think the credit market is starting to overheat, we can force the banks to hold more capital and therefore be able to absorb more losses.  What we have right now is that we have brought in these mortgage rules, which I think are fairly severe in an European context but we are open to tightening them if we think it is needed.

If the cost of claims is going up and if companies cannot compensate through investment income, the end result is that premiums go up.

That is where lies the difficulty.  As a result, we have received volumes of correspondence from clients of banks that have been badly affected.  I will deal with some of their cases.  For example, clients may have written to their banks about their pre-March 2006 tracker mortgage and have gone through the process with the bank only to find that it does not respond or pushes them from pillar to post, often forcing them to get legal advice and legal services at a huge cost.

From 2010 to date, they have not received any approach from the bank that they consider to be constructive or helpful.  In fact, they have fought all the way and are now at the end of their tether.

Some of the replies have been as follows:  \"When you look at your mortgage we gave you the wrong set of terms and conditions due to a manual error.

However, there is only so much a soul can take and this tracker issue affects every single aspect of your life.  The appeals process has, in a nutshell, made me feel like I am on trial.  I cannot tell you how many times I have wondered what I did wrong and why I am in this position.  I am on trial because I am guilty of wanting to own my own home.  I was robbed of my money each month while each month also repaying the bank every instalment they asked for.  I never missed a payment but I am the one who is guilty.  I am the one through this whole process who has had to repeatedly justify my position through an appeals process to the same bank that robbed me monthly.  The banks broke the Customer Act 2007 and yet it is I, the consumer, who is guilty. <\/blockquote> <p>That sentiment rings through every single piece of correspondence that I have received.  I would love to see the Governor, to the extent of the law and beyond, pressing these banks that have now, in my opinion, regained the same level of arrogance that they had before the crisis struck.  I ask the Governor to understand the following.<\/p><p>The language that is being used on this is not informing the customer but is pushing them further away.  The actions of the banks through legal processes and so forth are frightening the same customers.  The banks should be dragged to the point of remedying the situation now.  It is unforgivable that they would do this to ordinary people who did no wrong.  That is my view.  Thousands of letters have been sent to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017040400002#LL00300","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491296400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>We also receive communications directly through a variety of mechanisms, including our public communications unit.

When one looks at this, and when one examines the correspondence that we have all received, and there is a huge amount of it, it is clear that the bank took action to take money from their customers illegally.

Some of these people dealt with the banks for 20 and 30 years, and now they are being treated like this.  If the banks were really honest about it and wanted to resolve this, we would not be having these committee meetings.  They would be out in the regions, meeting their customers, calling them in and offering them a course of action.  We are going to have to call in the banks again now to go through all the details with them because they are simply not telling the truth about their engagement with the different affected customers.<\/p> <p>  I accept the job the Central Bank is doing, but there is something not right here and there is a relationship issue between the banks and their customers.
