We now know that three women at the centre of ten outstanding legal cases against the State relating to incorrect smear tests have died.  The State Claims Agency was apparently told by CervicalCheck during the Vicky Phelan case that the women had been told.  We now know of course that this was not the case.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the forthcoming cases - this came across yesterday in a fairly frank exchange at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform involving the director general of the State Claims Agency and others - that the State may not have a liability and that, in fact, liability may lie with the US companies involved..  It seems, therefore, that no guarantees can yet be given to the women involved in those cases to the effect that they will not have to go through the same treatment as Vicky Phelan.  Has the Government considered this issue?  Will the Taoiseach indicate the steps the Government intends to take to prevent further trauma to women involved in such cases?  The director general of the agency said that in cases where the State has liability, they would be dealt with differently.  We know that in many instances we are talking about cases involving the actual screening companies.  Furthermore, at yesterday's committee meeting, the director general, in response to questions from Deputy MacSharry and others, indicated that if section 30(2)(b) of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 had been commenced, then the approach adopted by the State Claims Agency could have been different.<\/p><p>The section relates to pre-action protocols designed to secure an early resolution in clinical negligence claims by ensuring there is disclosure of all medical and other records in the hopes of reducing the number of cases.  Why, then, has section 30(2)(b) of the 2015 Act not been commenced by the Minister for Justice and Equality?  I understand it was signed into law towards the end of 2015.  The State Claims Agency and other bodies get attacked all the time in the immediate aftermath of a crisis but we can hardly blame officials if an Act or a section has not been commenced and certain options the Oireachtas intended to provide them with are not, therefore, open to them.  Were there consultations between health and justice officials on that issue?<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach said yesterday in the House that there were approximately 1,600 cases.  These are the 1,600 cases announced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, last Tuesday night which had been notified to the National Cancer Registry but which had not been notified to CervicalCheck.  The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that the vast majority of those 1,600 cases would not need to be part of the audit for reasons he set out.  Can the Taoiseach state categorically that there are no issues relating to those 1,600 cases?  Deputy Kelly made a number of observations last evening in terms of the level of knowledge of the Department of Health on issues between the cancer registry and the CervicalCheck programme in the context of data interchange and all of that.  Are the Taoiseach and the Minister aware of such issues?  Has the Department been aware of such issues down through the years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525871100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, new information and revelations continue to become available on this issue.  That is exactly why we have established this inquiry, namely, to get to the bottom of this and establish the facts in order that we can put things right to restore confidence in cancer screening.  Like other Members, members of the Government are often hearing information that is new.  That is why it is right for us to set up the inquiry, which will be able to get to the bottom of all these facts and give people the answers they need.<\/p>  <p>  I understand there are nine outstanding court cases with perhaps one further case where a letter of claim has issued but proceedings have not yet begun.  Nobody wants to see sick people or terminally ill women dragged through the courts.  The public does not want that and it is in nobody's interest.  It is certainly not in the interests of the taxpayer in the longer run, of confidence in our health service or of patients or citizens.  I have asked the Attorney General to work with the State Claims Agency to examine the different cases with a view to settling them, albeit it takes two sides to do so, or resolving them by way of mediation as soon as possible in order that they do not have to go to court.  I made that request to the Attorney General last week.  It may turn out that one or more of these cases is similar or identical to that of Ms Vicky Phelan but it may also be the case that some are very different.  We cannot assume that all of these cases are the same.  In each case, a medical expert will have to look at the smear or slide and determine what category it falls into.  Certainly, the Government's intention is to settle these cases as soon as possible or deal with them by way of mediation if possible.  I have asked the Attorney General to work with the State Claims Agency to do exactly that in the short period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The best thing we can do in the longer term is to avoid these cases going to court in the first instance.  That can be done in a number of ways.  A whole reform programme has been initiated by the Government over the past couple of years to reduce the number of cases ending up in court or requiring lengthy legal proceedings.  The House will be aware of what we have done already around open disclosure by way of putting voluntary open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, which was passed last year and which will be enacted in law by June.<\/p><p>We have also announced this week that we will put in place mandatory open disclosure through the patient safety Bill in cases of serious incidents.<\/p> <p> There has also been a programme of law reform.  For example, the Mediation Act has been enacted and is now a reality.  The Act will allow mediation to occur in more circumstances.  In the past couple of weeks, some cases have already been settled through mediation.  We would like to see more.  There are also periodic payment orders.  The legislation for those has been passed in order to ensure that we do not have the same situation we have had for years in the context of very big settlements of &euro;10 million or &euro;13 million being made when it would be better to have settlements over a period that could be increased as needs be.  Other new legislation we introduced is the Legal Services Regulation Act, which the Deputy mentioned.  It provides for pre-action protocols to speed up cases so that they are not continually being referred.  That has not been commenced yet because the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which is the body that will deal with it, has only been established in the past few months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525871400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>What body?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525871400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Legal Services Regulatory Authority.

While Mr. O'Brien was making that declaration, I received a call from Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na from Kerry.  She asked me to raise her case with the Taoiseach.  Emma is 37 years old and is the mother of five children aged between two and 15 years of age.  She received a clear result from a smear test in 2013 but she now knows that the result was, in fact, a false negative.  She received a diagnosis of cervical cancer after a routine smear test in 2016.  She only learned of the false negative for the previous test as this scandal has unfolded.<\/p><p>She wants the Taoiseach to know that she is terminally ill, that she will present on Friday for a medical assessment at which she expects she will be given an estimate of how long she is expected to live.  Emma wants the Taoiseach to know that she has been told to get her affairs in order and to make provision for her five children.  Emma is extremely angry.  She says her faith has been shaken to its core.  She tells me that her anger outweighs even her fear of dying.  She wants the Taoiseach to know that she wants accountability.  She has asked me to tell him that she cannot understand why he is sitting on his hands.  She cannot wrap her head around why he has not done the very first thing that is needed to ensure the start of accountability.  I told the Taoiseach yesterday, as I have said before, that people outside of this place see two Irelands: they see a well-paid senior public executive sitting in a committee room brazening things out and then they see a terminally ill woman in her living room who knows she does not have much time left, who knows - or at least suspects - that it could have been very different and who is left wondering how her children will cope.<\/p> <p> I could make all the political reform arguments in the world as to why Tony O'Brien must go; I have made some of them previously.  I could make all the good governance and public policy arguments as to why this man needs to go.  We could go back and forth on that all day long.  However, that all pales into absolute insignificance when one compares it with what a woman like Emma is feeling and articulating today.  The buck must stop somewhere and accountability must start somewhere.  Emma has no confidence in Tony O'Brien, the public and the women and families affected have no confidence in Tony O'Brien, the Opposition has no confidence in Tony O'Brien and three of the Taoiseach's own Cabinet members have said he should stand down, yet the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health refuse to act.<\/p> <p> When the Taoiseach gets to his feet, I do not want him to answer me; I would like him to speak to Emma.  I want him to answer Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  I want him to explain to her why he is allowing Tony O'Brien to continue as usual, why he refuses to hold him to account and why he is ignoring her voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900005#C02100","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525872000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The most egregious aspect of this whole affair is that important information about women's health was withheld from them, and that was absolutely wrong.  We all know that the audit did not commence until these women had already been diagnosed with cancer and were being treated, so providing them with that information would not have impacted on their treatment.  However, they should have been told anyway.  People have a right to know information about their healthcare.  Doctors, officials and anyone else involved in managing their cases or looking after them have no basis on which not to pass on that information.  As Deputies will know, this has been HSE policy for all staff since 2013 and is in the Medical Council guidelines.  Part of the inquiry that is now under way must get to the bottom of why this information was not passed on to women in the way it should have been as they ought to have known.  This is absolutely the most inexplicable and egregious aspect of this whole affair.<\/p>  <p>  As I said yesterday, people want accountability.  The Government wants accountability as much as the Opposition does.  People are annoyed, and I am annoyed, about the way this has been handled in recent weeks, the drip-drip of information and the misinformation from some quarters.  We, as politicians, need to ensure we are never part of putting across misinformation because that does a terrible disservice to the women affected.  We have seen at least a degree of personal accountability so far, the clinical director of CervicalCheck having resigned and the manager of CervicalCheck being moved aside and replaced by Damien McCallion, head of the serious incident management team.  We have an inquiry that is under way and can get to the facts and assess whether more needs to be done and whether more individuals need to be held to account.  As I said yesterday, more heads may well yet roll but it is important they are the right heads and that people who are dismissed are dismissed because of something they actually did wrong or failed to do, having known about it.  That is something we cannot say with certainty at present.<\/p><p>As I said yesterday, for me and for some of those affected, this is not primarily about looking for a head; it is about establishing the facts, getting to the bottom of the matter and putting it right, restoring faith in our cancer screening system and ensuring it does not happen again.  <\/p> <p> Mr. O'Brien has approximately eight weeks left before he finishes his term of office, at which point an interim HSE director will be appointed by the Minister for Health.

I do not dispute the sequence of events and share the Taoiseach's view that the most egregious offence was the withholding of information.  We cannot with all certainty state whether in each case the withholding of that information had a material affect in diagnosis and subsequent treatment.  Let others decide on that.  What Emma told me is that she sees is the Taoiseach, the leader of Government, fail her.  Has it occurred to the Taoiseach that women like Emma might not be around to hear the results of these inquiries?  Mr. O'Brien has eight or 12 weeks left, depending on when he takes his leave, but who is to say how long Emma has?  She has a very simple request of the Taoiseach, and it is a challenge to him as Head of Government because it is something that we do not do in this jurisdiction.  The Tony O'Briens of this world do not stand down, and Governments here do not sack them or tell them to clear their desks.  She wants to see the start of accountability now.

These posters use imagery and information that is clearly wrong, that cannot be checked and that is not verifiable at all.  We must act to ensure that the use of such posters cannot continue.

That is a welcome measure on its part.  While Google has gone a bit further and is not accepting advertisements to do with the referendum altogether, I think Facebook has made the right decision to not accept advertisements paid for by bodies from other countries.  Whether advertisements are for a yes vote or a no vote, we all hold by the principle that foreign money should not be used to influence elections and referendums in this country.  The decision Facebook has made in that regard is very welcome.  Perhaps it could have come sooner but it has come and is very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I share Deputy Pringle's concerns about some of the posters we have seen around the country, some of which are extraordinarily inaccurate in the claims made on them and some of which are, frankly, quite grotesque.  I have often spoken to parents on the campaign trail whose children have asked them to explain the images on the posters and what the posters mean.  For people who purport to be concerned about children, putting parents in a position where they have to explain these things to children based on the images on the posters says a lot about their true motivations and hearts.<\/p>  <p>  It has never been the case in Ireland that we have regulated people's posters.  If we were to regulate people's posters we might also argue in favour of regulating literature because the same kind of images that appear on posters can also be put on literature put through doors.  We need some consideration of the issue, perhaps on an all-party basis, but it would be a big move to give any authority to ourselves, or even to an electoral commission or referendum commission when established, to decide what sorts of posters and literature are allowed and what sorts are not.  It could start from very good intentions but move on to become a restriction on democracy and freedom of speech.  If we do anything like that we would need to do it on an all-party basis.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, which covers electoral matters, could give some consideration to the issue after this referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900008#F00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525873200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.

They cannot be offensive or anything else like that.<\/p><p>It is possible to regulate posters and this begs the question as to why the posters in question have not been regulated.

Doing so is vital.<\/p> <p> The matter is probably more stark in the run-up to the forthcoming referendum.  It is a referendum campaign that is dividing people and generating strong opinions on both sides.  That is different from what happens during most elections.  In most elections, our faces are on the posters.  People might find them offensive but that is a different story.  We really should be capable of dealing with the images used on posters.

Regulating where posters may be placed for reasons of road safety is different from regulating the content of posters, be it the words or images.  This is not something we can resolve over the next couple weeks.  We could definitely ask the committee to examine it, however.

All attempts by the Taoiseach and the Government to convince the people that what he is proposing is a restrictive abortion regime are being exposed as the complete falsehoods that they are.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, would know that if he displayed even one ounce of political courage and responded to the numerous requests made to him, by the Save the Eighth campaign and others, to conduct an open debate on this matter.  Unfortunately, he is in hiding on this issue.<\/p><p>Despite that fact, we have a health service that is almost in total paralysis.  It is in total paralysis as far as I am concerned, yet the Minister takes no responsibility.  He is the head appointed to office by the Taoiseach to deal with these issues but he lacks courage and will not take responsibility in this area.  Instead, he chooses to spend his time campaigning with individuals and organisations that are in open defiance of Irish electoral law.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach some time ago and he said he had no issue with this.  I find that staggering.  The Taoiseach has no issue with the fact that the Minister campaigns with people operating outside the law.  Where are the Taoiseach standards?  A senior Minister in the Government is championing a group that made clear and illegal use of &euro;120,000 but the Taoiseach believes that is perfectly fine.  No wonder there is no accountability in the HSE or anywhere else.  Not only has the Taoiseach undermined the integrity of his own campaign, he has also insulted the independence and integrity of the Standards in Public Office Commission, which made the judgment against Amnesty Ireland.<\/p><p>That said, I ask the Taoiseach to clarify some issues that have arisen following comments made by the Minister in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>last weekend.  The Minister mentioned that the general scheme of the Bill, which I have to hand, provides for early delivery and specifically prohibits the possibility of late-term abortions.  Where in the heads of the Bill is the prohibition on late-term abortion to be found?  I ask the Taoiseach to explain.  I have read the Bill, as have others, and we cannot see it anywhere.  I ask the Taoiseach to take some accountability for his Ministers.  He has appointed them, under seal from the President, yet they can campaign with people who have acted outside the law and blatantly told everyone that they would keep the money and would not pay it back.  Everybody in here operates under the Standards in Public Office Commission, and rightly so, and every elected official throughout the country must do so.  Will Amnesty Ireland get away with this?  Is it okay for the Taoiseach's Ministers to champion this organisation on the streets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900009#G00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1525874400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I strongly disagree with the Deputy.  He seems to be assuming that the referendum is over and that the proposition will be defeated.  I believe that the referendum and campaign are ongoing.  I was on the doors in Clonsilla in my constituency as part of a cross-party canvass, listening to people, hearing their views and answering some of their questions.  I believe that this referendum will carry.  The people have not spoken yet.  When they have spoken, we will count the votes and determine what they have said.  It is somewhat arrogant for anyone to assume the outcome of this referendum already.  At the start of this campaign, I said something that I really believe, which is that this campaign should always be respectful and should never be personalised.  By and large, I am glad that has been the case so far.  Unlike previous abortion referendums, this campaign has largely been respectful and has rarely been personalised but I regret the extent to which some people, including Deputy Mattie McGrath, have sought to personalise this against the Minister, Deputy Harris.  That is absolutely wrong.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is putting forward a proposal that the Government is making following an all-party committee, following a Citizens' Assembly.  The people will have their say on that.  I do not think he, or anyone on any side of this referendum, should be targeted personally in any way, whether through posters, demands for one-to-one debates, or anything of that nature.  It is wrong and it is not what people want.<\/p>  <p>  Amnesty International's current campaign is registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  It is above board and I do not believe anyone has produced any evidence to the contrary.  The Deputy is referring to a different campaign it ran maybe a year or two ago, against which SIPO has made some negative findings.  That matter is now before the courts.  Its current campaign on this referendum is registered with SIPO just like any NGO campaign of this nature.  It is wrong to confuse the two.  Perhaps it is deliberate but it is wrong either way.<\/p>  <p>  On the legislation before us, the legislation that the Government has produced allows for a woman to decide to end her pregnancy if she decides she does not want to go ahead with that pregnancy up to 12 weeks into it.  That is ten weeks from conception.  It allows for the termination of pregnancies after that on the grounds that there may be a serious risk to her life or health, or in the case where the baby she is carrying will not survive as a result of a fatal foetal abnormality.  It does not provide for the termination of pregnancies beyond viability and that is in the heads.  There is an important point that we need to make and understand, which is that if there is not a yes vote, there will be no legislation at all.  If there is not a Yes vote, things will remain exactly as they are now.  There will be no legislation.  Women who are victims of rape, who are pregnant as a result of incest or who are just children themselves will not be able to get the help they need in this country.  Those who are advocating a No vote need to explain why they would turn their backs on those women and give them the cold shoulder.  That is what a No vote would mean.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900010#H00100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525874400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I never mentioned Amnesty International.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900010#H00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1525874400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Yes, he did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900010#H00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525874400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1525874400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I said Amnesty Ireland.

He chose not to answer me on that and I did not assume at all that the referendum was over.  While head 4 of the general scheme says that the life of the unborn child cannot be ended once it has reached viability, there is no evidence of where this will be set.  To understand that, I suggest that the Taoiseach reads the definitions contained in the general scheme.  Even more disturbing is the fact that, directly following head 4, provision is made in head 5 to nullify or cancel out the prohibitions contained in head 4.  There is utter confusion.  This clearly demonstrates that all of the claims the Taoiseach and his Ministers are making about protecting the child once it reaches viability are an absolute nonsense and are not worth the paper they are written on.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, know that.  The Taoiseach and I know that it is simply one more tactic that is being used by this Government to disguise the extreme nature of the proposal.

Taking those three things into account, the two doctors - there must be two doctors, both of whom are on the specialist register, to certify a termination beyond 12 weeks - will make the judgment as to whether or not the pregnancy has reached viability.  A pregnancy can only be terminated after 12 weeks if two doctors, both of whom are on the specialist register, determine that there is a serious risk to the life or health of the mother and that the pregnancy is not viable.  If it has reached the point of viability, a compassionate early delivery occurs and every effort is made to save the life of the baby at that point as well as the life of the mother.<\/p> <p> The legislation being put forward by the Government is not extreme.  It is considerably more conservative than the situation in the UK or the Netherlands.  It is very similar to the law in Germany.  One individual I met on the doorstep last night was a woman from Germany who explained to me how it works there.  It is very similar to what we have proposed where there is a cooling-off period of 72 hours, which gives the woman concerned a crucial period in which to consider other options and avail of counselling.

I think the Taoiseach indicated that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has not been established but it has been established.  It was announced to have been established in 2016.  Section 32B is not dependent on the authority.  The section concerns how to deal with clinical negligence issues.  The very heart of the Vicky Phelan case and the cases before the State Claims Agency were cases against the State.  The idea around section 32B was to prevent that kind of trauma and to give tools to the State Claims Agency to settle early, to provide for disclosure of medical and all other records and to work towards an early resolution.  The Minister is obliged to work with other Ministers and other agencies to bring about pre-action protocols.  This has not happened.  It was suggested yesterday at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that if this section had been commenced, things might have been different.  I am not saying definitively that they would have been different but they might have been different and a different approach might have been taken to these cases - from the State's perspective at any rate.  We are good at empathy and rhetoric but very poor at seeing through what we have committed to in legislation.  The Act was signed into law in December 2015.  It is now May 2018.  That key section dealing with how the State deals with people who have cases against it has not been commenced.  Does that not go to the heart of the problem and cut across all the rhetoric we have heard in the past two weeks?  We and the public need and are entitled to some explanation as to why that section has not been commenced.  The programme for Government promised mandatory disclosure.  That did not happen.

I believe that, to date, the Government has refused to answer the question I asked a number of months ago as to what each party here spends on Facebook advertising, in a spirit of transparency and honesty regarding political advertising, of which we are all in support.  Will the Government provide those figures and will it legislate to regulate online advertising in political elections and referendums?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900013#L01500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525875600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

When we open new embassies and representative offices, there is a direct and continuous benefit to Ireland and our people.  What is missing in the plan to increase our international reach is a strategic approach to achieving this.  We must have focused priorities and be clear in setting out what we are trying to achieve.  Previous expansions in China and Asia, in particular during the late 1990s when we developed the first Asia strategy, have borne much fruit.  I recall as a former Minister with responsibility for enterprise putting pressure on a reluctant IDA to set up an office in China as we have to put roots down and may not get a return for a significant period afterwards.  Those expansions were accompanied by cross-governmental strategies which set out specific targets and ongoing objectives from agriculture to industry as well as political objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Immediately after the Brexit referendum, we were promised a detailed study of its staffing implications for the Civil Service and public service generally.  What is the status of this study?  Given the fact that there must be a training and development period before new recruits can operate at a high level, the obvious question is whether current recruitment is at a high enough level to fill the positions being created in time to deal with Brexit.  What specific international models is the Government seeking to follow?  Is it a case of expanding what we do or is there an intention to try new models, for example the way Scandinavian states frequently share facilities to reduce the cost of consular activities and support services?  Has an assessment been undertaken on staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach who are now required to work on Brexit?  Have staff numbers already been increased and is the Taoiseach satisfied that the expertise required is available?

Those are all very good aims which Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  An increased diplomatic presence around the world will no doubt increase the likelihood of delivering on those very goals.

When is it envisaged that they will open?  The Taoiseach has indicated that a new consulate general will open in Frankfurt and that our footprint on the west coast of the USA will be increased.  In the latter stages of the previous Government, of which we were both members, we increased our footprint in Asia.

He is seeking to isolate Iran, impose sanctions and escalate a dangerous conflict in the Middle East.  Many countries which are signatories of the nuclear deal with Iran are, rightly, rejecting what President Trump is saying and contending that the deal should be maintained.  It is important in this context for Ireland to nail its colours to the mast on this.  One way of doing so would be to restore an Irish embassy to Iran.  There have been calls to do so independently of the current situation by the Irish Cattle &amp;amp; Sheep Farmers' Association and the Iranians are very keen on it also.  They have even offered to provide the building in Tehran.  All they want is diplomats to be sent over.  Iran has very many questions to answer about its policies in Syria and other parts of the Middle East, but we have embassies with many questionable regimes, including, for example, the Saudis and Israel, which has refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty while Iran has.  It is important, as this conflict is being escalated by Trump, that we send a message that we are not engaging in a confrontation with Iran.

Our new target is to publish it before the summer recess.  The idea behind this is to expand our embassy and agency presence around the world according to a plan rather than in the <i>ad hoc<\/i>way it has happened in more recent years.  Draft versions of the document exist but I am not entirely happy with them.  I am happy with what has been put forward by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the different agencies, but the existing draft is a bit weak when it comes to the permanent representation.  We will have to increase our presence in Brussels to a considerable extent in the absence of the support and alliance of the UK there.  We will be the only common law country in the EU and will have to build up new alliances.  As such, we will have to increase the permanent representation.  We will also have to look at the UK itself.  When it is outside the EU, we will need to find new ways to maintain the bilateral relationship.  The possibility exists of opening consulates in regional cities.  For example, we may reopen the consulate in Cardiff.<\/p><p>Having read the draft, it occurred to me that it was not strong enough on areas like culture, education and connectivity.  Our culture, arts, dance, music and literature are often the window through which a lot of people see Ireland for the first time, in particular in Asia and Africa.  It is an area which needs to be strengthened.  We can also be more ambitious around international education to encourage more international students to study here.  There is also an opportunity to build on the success we have had to date on connectivity.  Only a couple of years ago, there were no direct flights to the west coast of the USA whereas we now have flights to Seattle, San Francisco and LA.  Direct flights to two cities in China will also commence this summer.<\/p><p>The draft is strong on embassies and agencies but, as already noted, perhaps it is not strong enough in the context of the other aspects relating to expanding our global footprint, namely, culture, education and connectivity.  However, I believe we will get there over the next couple of weeks.<\/p> <p> A staff census of the different agencies and Departments is done as part of the document.  In terms of the models we have been examining, we have been looking at other small countries such as Denmark, which is a similar size to ours but which has many more suits and boots on the ground for what it does through its diplomats and agencies.  Interestingly, Denmark is paring that back whereas we are going in the other direction and expanding.  We have not planned to share with other countries.  I had not even thought of that but it is not part of the plan at present.<\/p> <p> It is intended to have more Ireland House establishments but that depends on where they should be.  For example, one of the potential locations for a new Ireland House would be Tokyo in Japan.  However, that would not make sense in countries such as Germany where the political capital is Berlin but where the economic activity is in Frankfurt.  It does not make sense to put an Ireland House in Berlin.  Similarly, in Australia, the political capital is Canberra but the business, tourism and other markets are in Sydney and Melbourne.  It makes sense in some countries but not in others.<\/p> <p> On Brexit, I am satisfied that we have adequate staff in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade and across the various agencies.  However, we must keep a watching brief on that because, as matters develop, we might need to respond to Brexit in different ways.<\/p> <p> The new embassies in Chile, New Zealand, Jordan and Colombia and the consulates in Los Angeles, Vancouver and Mumbai will all open either this year or next year.  We are also going to upgrade the existing office in Liberia to embassy status and expanding in Austin from one person to two.  All of this is under way.  In Chile, an ambassador-designate has already been appointed.<\/p> <p> Doubling our global footprint means doubling our impact.  It is done through a combination of measures and does not mean necessarily doubling offices, budgets and staff.  It means doubling our impact by a combination of increases in staff, budgets and offices and things such as education and culture.<\/p> <p> The Government supports the Iran nuclear agreement.  We believe it has helped to stabilise that region and has slowed down, if not stopped, Iran's nuclear enrichment programme.  We are aligned with our EU allies, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in their support for the agreement.  The Trump Administration has made a policy mistake in resiling from the agreement.  I expect we will discuss it next week in Bulgaria at the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government.  The Tehran embassy is under consideration again.  We had an embassy there for a long time but it was one of the embassies shut during the financial crisis.  As it is an expanding economy with a big population and it is an expanding regional power it is definitely on the list for consideration for an embassy in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900018#Q00800","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","time":1525878900,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900019#R00200"},{"type":"question","time":1525878900,"counter":200,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[19096\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900019#R00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the overall number of staff employed in his Department in 2018 compared with 2017.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1525878900,"counter":201,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[19723\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900019#R00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on staffing levels in his Department.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1525878900,"counter":202,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[20061\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900019#R00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of staff employed in his Department in the past 12 months.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525878900,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 207.5 whole-time equivalent staff working in my Department.

Will he also indicate what the division of responsibility is within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of both of these areas?<\/p>  <p>  We touched on issues pertaining to the institutions in the North yesterday and the Taoiseach made some remarks in that regard.  I wish to raise a couple of issues with him on foot of what was said.  First, Sinn F&eacute;in is absolutely committed to getting the institutions back up and running.  We have met the Government and the British Government in recent weeks and emphasised that point to both.  The fact remains, however, that, after 14 months of negotiation and having reaching a draft agreement or accommodation, the DUP balked at dealing with language rights, marriage equality and implementing agreements on legacy issues.  It has, in effect, checked out of power-sharing.  This is due to its pact with the Tories, which is now the greatest obstacle to the restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government fails to confront the DUP's anti-rights agenda in order to protect its own narrow interests.  The British Government has a responsibility under the Good Friday Agreement to deal with the rights issues at the heart of this political impasse.  These issues are not going away and they must be addressed.  In that context, it is incumbent on both Governments to convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to provide a framework for the resolution of these outstanding issues and for the honouring of agreements.  I acknowledge the efforts of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in requesting that this happen.  The time for the British Government stalling because of its pact with the DUP is over.  It must act.<\/p>  <p>  What conversations has the Taoiseach had with the British Government and the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, in respect of convening the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference?  That must happen as a matter of urgency.

For my own information as much as anything, he might indicate with some clarity the structure of the Brexit team.  As I understand it, the team is headed up by a very fine public servant from his Department, Mr. John Callinan, who is the sherpa dealing with these matters in Brussels and reporting directly to the Taoiseach.  Will he outline the structure of the team under him and tell me how many are in it?<\/p>  <p>  Economics is obviously a strategic part of the work of the Department of the Taoiseach and across all Departments.  As far as I can recall, the Taoiseach does not currently have a specific economics adviser.  I think he is the first Taoiseach for some time not to have one.  Is it his intention to appoint such an adviser?  I think it is a position that will become increasingly important.<\/p>  <p>  The entire reform agenda was clearly a matter with which I grappled when in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not say this in any way to be critical of the current incumbent but it seems that the merger in political responsibility of the Ministries of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform means, in essence, that the reform agenda has slipped back.  That is a mistake.  Driving reform on a permanent basis is really important.  There are big issues emerging such as, for example, Sl&aacute;intecare.  The latter obviously falls primarily within the remit of the Department of Health.  However, the Department of the Taoiseach needs to drive the agenda in order to ensure that matters of this nature are deal with.  Is there a component part within his Department in this regard?

We do not need a survey to tell us that people need to know more about the benefits of good health or that they would benefit from good health.  However, there are areas of information deficits, and part of the citizens' survey, whenever it is carried out, will be to identify where there are such deficits and where people are not aware of Government policies and programmes.  If we repeat that survey every six or 12 months, we will be able to assess whether the campaigns are making a difference in increasing public awareness of these policies and programmes.<\/p>  <p>  I am still very much looking for savings in cross-governmental communications.  Even though the strategic communications unit is being wound down, the policy objective of seeking savings across spending on communications by Government and its agencies remains.  This is, of course, a matter of different circumstances on different occasions.  Semi-State agencies, for example, operate very differently from Government Departments and agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I would very much welcome the convening of the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I have spoken to Prime Minister May about this, both by telephone and in person.  I am making arrangements to meet her in Sofia in Bulgaria next week, if she attends.  I do not have confirmation yet as to whether she will be in attendance but convening of the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference is certainly one of the matters I would wish to discuss with her.  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, as the House will be aware, is one of the structures established under the Good Friday Agreement.  It provides a mechanism by which the Irish and British Governments may discuss matters relating to the agreement and to Northern Ireland.  However, it is wrong to suggest that the intergovernmental conference is a silver bullet.  It is not a body that has any authority or executive powers.  Merely convening it will not add any further dimension to it that cannot be achieved from a bilateral meeting between the Prime Minister and me, a meeting between the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland or other meetings that happen all the time.  I think to convene in this format would be beneficial but it would be wrong to think that merely convening it will produce a result or an outcome as it does not have decision-making powers.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding my advisers, I do not propose to appoint a specific economic adviser at present.

The role of the Taoiseach is to drive Government, drive the implementation of the programme for Government, bring Departments together and ensure there is a cross-Government approach to matters.  However, one needs to get the balance right between driving Departments and micromanaging them.  That can be difficult.

However, what was surprising is the lack of any urgency in what he said, and there being a significant step away from the strength of calls for actions by the parties which the Taoiseach made earlier this year.  Perhaps this is merely a reflection of the Taoiseach's new support base, it is important to look after one's voters.<\/p>  <p>  The absence of the anti-Brexit majority in Northern Ireland from any major discussions happening between the devolved administrations and London causes damage every day.  That is something that was made clear by the leaked documents which Sinn F&eacute;in published in Brussels last week.  Given the scale of the threat posed by the non-functioning institutions and the British Government's refusal to establish the former consultation processes with Dublin used during previous suspensions, it was very surprising that yesterday the Taoiseach said that he has had no conversation with the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, in the past six weeks.  Did he seek a conversation that was rejected by London or is it really the case that in the midst of the twin crises of Brexit and the suspended Belfast institutions, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister see nothing wrong with failing to speak for six weeks?<\/p>  <p>  I am perfectly willing to believe that a combination of chaos and disinterest in London is the cause but I do not think the Taoiseach will find a period in the past 25 years when a Taoiseach and a Prime Minister went for so long without talking, especially during such a crisis as that of the suspension of Northern institutions or of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Taoiseach's earlier comments but I think an intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now.  The maximum utilisation of the agreement is imperative.  Otherwise elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance.  That ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900021#T00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525880100,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I did not know, until I heard the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il make the point, that there had not been communication between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for six weeks.  That is remarkable.  At the same time the Taoiseach was visiting communities in the North, and I welcome the details of the visit, the Oireachtas had its session in Dundalk with Michel Barnier.  If one looks at what was said there and couples it with what we have seen and heard from London in the last week, it is clear that we are on course for a crash-out Brexit rather than a deal.  That is my assessment of where it seems to be going, not what I would want it.  That is of huge consequence for everyone and should be our political focus, including communications with the British Government.  It also calls into question North-South communications and our need to maintain good relations with all parties, representatives and all people on this island during what will be a difficult and bumpy period.<\/p>  <p>  I have one suggestion for the Taoiseach.  I understand that on the same day he visited those schools and the people in Warrenpoint, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was meeting my colleague, the leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland for the first time.  It had proved difficult to set up that meeting.  It took time.  Worse still is that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland refuses to meet parties such as our own.  The Taoiseach once responded to me that there are two tiers of parties in the North, there are the big five to whom the Taoiseach speaks and then the smaller parties.  We must get through this incredibly difficult time in Irish history and avoid a continuation of sectarian divisive politics.  One of the paths back to talking to unionist and nationalist communities and moving away from the sectarian divide is to start talking to all parties and engaging them in the process.  Relying on the big two, or nationalists and unionists and the sectarian divide as the inevitable outcome of the Good Friday Agreement, is not clever at this time.  Engaging with people such as my colleague, Steven Agnew and others will allow us to start breaking down those sectarian barriers and start connecting with the nationalist and unionist community in the North during what could be a very rocky moment in Irish and British history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900021#T00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525880100,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's visit to the North.  I thank him for his report on the visit.  I take it that Warrenpoint was chosen specifically with the Brexit dynamic in mind.  The significance of the port in Warrenpoint cannot be overstated.  It has a growing reputation.  Its location is halfway between Dublin and Belfast, and is at the centre of growing trade on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  It is a healthy thing and it would be welcome for the Taoiseach to visit the North as regularly as he can.  Unlike others, I do not believe that the Taoiseach must meet party political people all the time, it is not necessary although it is necessary that all the parties are met, including Mr. Agnew and the Green Party, and I see no reason why that should not happen.  However, I should say that the reason the institutions are down is not because of a sectarian divide, <i>per se<\/i>, although the North is a State which was created and defined on the basis of a sectarian headcount and the Good Friday Agreement is the vehicle for moving beyond that.  The reason the institutions are down is because of a failure by the DUP to really buy into and sign up for power sharing.<\/p><p>We have a set of issues that need to be resolved.  We had them resolved in February, to be fair.  The accommodation was not perfect from a nationalist perspective but we were convinced that it was enough to move on; the DUP took a different view.  That is why I raise the issue of the intergovernmental conference once again.  I know there is no silver bullet and nobody has a magic wand in this scenario but I also know that we need a forum, a mechanism and a momentum within which we can sort these matters out and provide a roadmap and the resources necessary for so doing.  I also believe that such a mechanism must be within the architecture and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which is why the intergovernmental conference is so important.  I also believe that it should have been convened by this stage.  It is very dangerous to allow this to drift.  I understand there are tensions from Dublin to London, as well as an obvious and perhaps unavoidable tension, given the broader Brexit politics.  I am fully <i>au fait <\/i>with the dynamics of between the DUP and the Tories, which are most unhelpful, but we need to sort these issues out and we can.  However, if the Taoiseach is not prepared to force the pace on these matters, the Tories will very happily sit back.  Some of their leading lights, their hard Brexiteers, would be more than happy to put the Good Friday Agreement through the shredder and I know this because they have stated that very publicly, and when they said it, they meant it.  We should take them at their word.  I urge the Taoiseach to press this matter very hard with Theresa May and the British Government, namely, that we convene this intergovernmental conference without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900021#T00500","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1525880100,"counter":230,"content":"<p>There has not been a formal telephone call or meeting between the two of us in about six weeks, nor has there been a request for one in either direction.

That also will be subject to confirmation.  Prime Minister May and I have each other's mobile phone numbers and it is possible for us to contact each other whenever we need to but currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and the various Cabinet meetings taking place in the UK to determine their position on the customs union or the customs union partnership and how that might evolve.<\/p><p>Currently the focus has been on the negotiations in Brussels and on the various Cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union or a customs union partnership and how that position might evolve.  The most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British Government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement.  Absent that, it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment.  There are, of course, many other contacts at official level through the ambassador.  In recent weeks the Minister for Finance met with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the T&aacute;naiste met with David Lidington.  Of course we compare notes on what happens at those meetings and what messages are coming across from London to Dublin with regard to where things might go and what the British Cabinet might decide on the customs dilemma, which seems to be taking up a lot of its time.<\/p> <p> On the Green Party in Northern Ireland, I certainly regret that it took so long to organise a meeting with the T&aacute;naiste.  I am very much of the view that we should engage with all parties in Northern Ireland and I welcome the fact that there are forces in Northern Ireland other than unionist and nationalist forces, including the Alliance Party, the Green Party and also some socialist groups.  However, in scheduling meetings we obviously have to have regard to the respective mandate of each party and, whether we like it or not, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are very much the largest parties in Northern Ireland and represent the majority of each community respectively.  That is a reality of politics in the North.<\/p> <p> I was very keen to visit Warrenpoint, particularly because of Brexit as it is, in many ways, a cross-Border port.  Some 40% of its trade goes to or comes from south of the Border.  It was very interesting to talk to the people who use the port about how they believe customs controls could impact on their businesses, not necessarily or even particularly in the case of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but in the case of customs controls between the UK and other parts of the European Union, which could also have a real impact on people's businesses.

Under section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended, a preservation order may be made where it appears to the Minister that a monument, which in the Minister's opinion is a national monument, &quot;is in danger of being or is actually being destroyed, injured or removed or is falling into decay through neglect&quot;.  Apart from any question of whether each and every building referred to by the Deputy would appropriately be regarded as a national monument, I am not advised that they are subject to any immediate threat.  On the contrary, as the Deputy is aware from his membership of the Moore Street advisory forum, the owner is advancing plans to preserve and conserve many of these buildings, and in particular those with a direct connection to the events of Easter Week 1916.  Consequently, the conditions do not exist in which the making of a preservation order would be warranted in any event.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street comprise a national monument owned by the State.  It forms a unique and coherent streetscape of substantially intact mid-18th-century structures.  Collectively, Nos. 14 to 17 represent the most significant, original, complete, discrete and continuous section of substantially intact pre-1916 buildings on the street, most of the remainder being post-1916 buildings.  Today all of these houses retain significant 18th-century elements, including staircases, partitions, plasterwork, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures. <\/p><p>The 18th-century building form and profiles also survive.  More important, so too does the physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents in the form of the openings broken through party walls as they made their way up the street.  The Deputy has been privileged to see these at first hand.<\/p><p>By contrast, I note that No. 25 Moore Street, in respect of which the Deputy's question is seeking to have a preservation order made on grounds that it is a 1916 building, was actually constructed entirely anew from the ground up in the mid-1990s as a dedicated facility for Dublin City Council's street-cleansing operations. <\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>As a member of the Moore Street advisory group, and as noted earlier, the Deputy is aware of the meeting some weeks ago where agreement was reached on the modalities of engagement between the owners of the Moore Street development site and the advisory group to secure a way forward for the revitalisation of the area in a manner that will recognise the views of all stakeholders and reflect its historical and cultural significance and its employment and economic value to the north inner city - and all in a manner consonant with the recommendations of the previous Moore Street consultative group's work &quot;The Moore Street Report - Securing History&quot;.<\/p><p>The Deputy will recall that the key recommendation of this report was the establishment of the Moore Street advisory group, of which he is a member and which has the task of devising an agreed plan among the key stakeholders that will take account of the needs of the area in a way that also respects and acknowledges its importance in the context of the 1916 Rising and ultimately the foundation of the State.  Fundamental to this objective is the dialogue that is now taking place with the owners of the site that extends from Moore Street to the Carlton cinema in O'Connell Street.<\/p><p>I was very pleased to hear from the chairperson of the advisory group of the constructive engagement between group, including the Deputy, and the owners.  I believe that this is the appropriate way in which to address the issues relating to the site and its wider environs.  I am pleased that a foundation and framework has now been laid for positive and fruitful co-operation, dialogue and interaction between all the key interests in Moore Street under the aegis of the Moore Street advisory group.  I encourage the Deputy again to continue to engage and contribute to that process through his membership of the group, which I believe is best placed to deliver a satisfactory outcome for all stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900023#V00700","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525881300,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The O'Brien's Mineral Water Works building, Henry Place, was occupied and held by the Volunteers evacuating the GPO.

The Minister does not require planning permission for works to a national monument provided there is consent in place under section 14 of the National Monuments Act.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned why there is no necessity for a preservation order in the cases the Deputy mentions.  It would only be a distraction from the more important objective, which is to secure a viable future for the Moore Street area.

As we work together to ensure that people are heard and listened to, we will see that the stories we tell, the work we make and the society we share begin to change shape for the better.

Dublin City Council cited the guidance from the Referendum Commission, which, in turn, restates the guidance from the Attorney General that public funds, as I said earlier, should not be used to promote either side of the debate during a referendum.  The mural referred to by the Deputy included the words &quot;Repeal the Eighth&quot; with a heart around them and was on the outside wall of the Project Arts Centre.  The mural was created by Maser, an artist originally from Ireland who now lives in the US.  Unfortunately, the mural ran contrary to the Charities Regulator's views on this.  I know the Taoiseach made comments in the D&aacute;il about it previously in response to a question from Deputy Coppinger.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>I understand this decision was made by the Charities Regulator, not the Government, and I assume the Charities Regulator would have taken the same approach or attitude had it been a pro-life or anti-abortion mural.  I have no doubt but that the mural will appear elsewhere.  Someone who owns a private building may wish to make the space available for the mural to be reinstated.  Perhaps even the fact that it has been removed means more people saw it than might have otherwise seen it had it not been removed.  While one can paint over a mural, one certainly cannot paint over an issue.  The issue is that nine women every day in Ireland are forced to travel overseas to end their pregnancies and three women in Ireland every day - the number will only rise into the future - import pills online and take them without medical supervision and guidance, often in their own homes.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900025#X01000","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525882500,"counter":298,"content":"<p>That is not really relevant to the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900025#X01100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1525882500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I am just quoting the comments the Taoiseach made in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900025#X01200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525882500,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Does the Minister not agree that there is a problem here?

Yet an arts centre cannot have a piece of art that refers to and has a slogan about the repeal of the eighth amendment on it because it does not relate to its core purpose, but it is art.  It is not campaigning; it is art.  The Government can have an opinion on it.

These crafts and skills are transmitted from generation to generation and constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history.  They contribute to our sense of identity and continuity, respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.  Heritage crafts include practices from traditional building skills in thatching, stonework and boat building, to lace-making and making hurleys and musical instruments such as harps and uilleann pipes.  Heritage crafts also include textile work such as spinning fleece, weaving and felting, rush and straw craft, rope making, traditional woodwork and heritage gardening.<\/p>  <p>  My Department protects and promotes heritage crafts through a number of avenues.  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, provides grants for the protection and preservation of the national heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website.<\/p>  <p>  The Heritage Council's heritage in schools scheme also promotes children's engagement with heritage crafts.  This scheme makes available to primary schools a current panel of 160 heritage experts, including experts in traditional crafts who visit primary schools to work directly with the pupils.  The scheme currently reaches nearly 100,000 primary school pupils over the course of 2,000 school visits each year.  The value of the scheme is in the richness and depth of knowledge it makes available to children and teachers, engaging children in a direct experience of their heritage, preferably outside the classroom, where possible and appropriate.  Practitioners of crafts are themselves part of the living heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900027#Z00400","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525883700,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's reply.

Now in its 66th year, the organisation has a growing international network and contributes significantly to our reputation abroad as a culturally rich nation.  Its work in Ireland has undoubtedly sustained and grown participation and enjoyment of Irish music, dance and the Irish language.  Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann is central to all these endeavours.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the critical role which Comhaltas plays in supporting our traditional heritage, my Department provides ongoing financial support to the organisation.  In 2018, my Department has allocated &euro;1.6 million to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann towards operational costs and onward support of regional branches and county boards.  Typically, regional branches organise their local fleadhanna cheoil and Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann is organised by the ard-chomhairle of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  This represents significant ongoing support in regard to all activities organised by Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann at both national and local level and to the benefit of any town chosen to host Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann.  As we will see this year in Drogheda, and in recent years in towns including Sligo, Ennis and Derry in Northern Ireland, the scale of the fleadh requires significant engagement and support from the relevant local authority.  I know this is willingly given by local authorities as they are aware of the prestige and other benefits which hosting the fleadh brings to the local area.  In this regard, I see the role of my Department, in addition to the major funding provided to Comhaltas itself, as supporting local authority capacity to develop cultural engagement and creativity locally.  This is in keeping with pillar 2 of the Creative Ireland programme, Enabling Creativity in Every Community, in which all local authorities are important partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900027#Z01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525883700,"counter":331,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows, Comhaltas was founded in 1951 in my home town of Mullingar and it has gone from strength to strength over the last decades.

There is interest in Mullingar in applying to host the Fleadh Cheoil in the future.<\/p>  <p>  This year a sum of &euro;3 million in total, comprising &euro;2 million from my Department and &euro;1 million from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, was allocated to all 31 local authorities.  This will enable them to implement the objectives contained in their five-year culture and creativity strategies and support an accompanying programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county, including building capacity to host local, provincial and national fleadhanna.  There is also the small-scale festivals and summer schools scheme which commenced formally in 2017.  The funding is reserved for appropriate festivals, summer schools and other similar events.  It is designed to support local cultural festivals and those which are not in receipt of other public moneys and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for large-scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies.  These projects make a very important contribution to the development and promotion of Ireland's cultural tourism offering to the benefit of the domestic and foreign tourists which Deputy Troy mentioned, and will represent an important component of the delivery of the culture and tourism commitments in the programme for Government.  The total amount available to this fund is &euro;75,000 and the maximum amount per applicant is proposed to be in the order of &euro;5,000.

It affects any provincial town that has to host a fleadh.  It is a phenomenal festival with 400,000 visitors descending on a town for a week.  It is worth &euro;40 million to the local economy.  There is nothing like it.  A total of 100,000 international visitors come in for it.  Given the work that Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann is doing to promote heritage internationally and attract people to our country, the Minister should consider funding the host town to put on the fleadh.

In granting the request for a second day&rsquo;s trial my Department took into account the fact that the national coursing meeting in Clonmel is the largest coursing meeting held during the season with some 160 hares run during the three day meeting.  I accepted the view that it would not have been possible to complete trails for this number of hares in one day at the time of year in February due to limited daylight.  In addition, taking account of safety and welfare reasons, it was considered that a second day&rsquo;s trial was needed in order to promote the  familiarisation of hares with the field and with the most direct route to the escape.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that until my Department issued a revised licence last year, it would have been possible for every single club in the country to hold trials over as many days as they wanted.  Clonmel was the only application that my Department received for a second day's trail since the licence to the ICC was amended in October last year.

Diabetes places a substantial burden on the individual, society and the economy.  Much of this burden is attributable to short-term and long-term complications.  Almost 190,000 people in Ireland have diabetes.  As the prevalence of diabetes rises, diabetes-related complications represent a growing global public health and health service challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Glucose monitoring allows people to self-manage diabetes by making adjustments to their diets, lifestyles and treatments to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.  Current glucose monitoring methods include self-monitoring of blood glucose.  This means finger-prick blood glucose monitoring using testing strips and electronic glucose meters, as well as continuous glucose monitoring, which needs to be calibrated with a blood sample.  The FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system is intended to be used as an alternative to current methods for people who administer multiple daily injections of insulin.  This innovative technology allows glucose readings to be taken non-invasively without the need to calibrate with a blood sample.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and the reimbursement of medical devices under the community drug schemes in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  In February 2017, an application by the manufacturer of the FreeStyle Libre device was submitted to the primary care reimbursement service, or PCRS, of the Health Service Executive for the reimbursement of its flash glucose monitoring system.  The HSE's health technology assessment group carried out an appraisal of the evidence submitted with this application and considered the FreeStyle Libre application for addition to the reimbursement list in line with the 2013 Act.  The health technology assessment group recommended that reimbursement for the device should be considered subject to certain conditions.  The HSE accepted this recommendations in principle and has developed an application suite for hospital clinicians to use when proposing suitable patients for consideration of individual reimbursement support.<\/p>  <p>  Continuous glucose monitoring is already available to some patients, including those whose endocrinologists have prescribed a particular type of insulin pump.  The FreeStyle Libre device is now being made available under the long-term illness scheme and the criteria for approval are as follows: the patient has type 1 diabetes; the patient is aged four to 21 years; the patient uses multiple daily injections of insulin or insulin pump therapy; the patient has increased blood glucose testing requirements; the patient has frequent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA, or hypoglycaemia which have included hospital admissions; and the patient is not pregnant.  Patients must be individually approved by their hospital clinicians.  I understand that adults who do not fulfil the criteria are concerned that the new technology is not available to them.  While the first phase of access to this product is confined to children and young adults, the application process allows a consultant to make an application in very exceptional circumstances for a type 1 diabetic patient outside this group.  There will be a review after 12 months to look at the evidence of the effectiveness of the device and to ensure that costs are in line with expectations.<\/p>  <p>  We have made huge strides in treating and managing diabetes and I welcome the HSE's decision to reimburse FreeStyle Libre, which is good news for young people and their parents.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is aware that patients with type 1 diabetes must test their glucose levels up to ten times a day and it is his hope that this innovative device will help to minimise inconvenience and discomfort for many children and young people.  The Minister must await the outcome of the review by the HSE of the effectiveness and efficiency of the FreeStyle Libre device before he is in a position to commit to its availability to all patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900032#EE00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1525886700,"counter":398,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has not really outlined why this has been restricted to the four to 21 years age cohort.

This is an era of finite not infinite resources and with any scheme like this there are two aspects.  There is the affordability aspect and there is also the question of ensuring something is a good and efficient product.  The decision taken has been to provide for a 12-month trial period and to review the efficacy of the device at that stage to determine whether it is an efficient treatment which, in layman's terms, does what it says on the tin.  As resources allow, we will progress it.  We all want to see it extended to the whole population, but we have to begin somewhere as we did with the roll-out of free GP care.

Earlier intervention with younger people was deemed to be a priority by the group looking at this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900032#EE00800","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1525886700,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Can the information on the exceptional circumstances be circulated to all of us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900032#EE00900","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1525886700,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900032#EE01000","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1525886700,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins.

According to an article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by Caroline O'Doherty, 25,000 elderly patients may be held illegally in nursing homes or residential settings.<\/p><p>The article also mentioned that a new State agency, the Decision Support Service, was being established to oversee the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.<\/p> <p> When I read the article, I was reminded of a case in my constituency.  I will not mention any names but I brought it to the attention of the Minister of State's predecessor.  In this case, a gentleman had been living with his nephew and his nephew's wife from 2011.  Unfortunately, he suffered a brain bleed in February 2014.  He was subsequently admitted to hospital and on 18 February 2014 was deemed to require long-term care.  At that time, there was significant pressure on bed capacity in the hospitals and, on 25 February, he was transferred to a nursing home funded by the State under the special delivery programme being run by the Government at the time.  On 9 September 2014, the family was informed that the HSE was going to petition the courts for wardship.  The family was not asked for its input on this but simply told about it.  The family wanted their loved one back home to reside with them but the HSE would not allow it.  The wife of the gentleman's nephew was a healthcare professional who was qualified to care for the gentleman and his condition, but the HSE still refused.  It refused to let him out for christenings with the family or for Christmas.  The gentleman had resided in this house.  It was his life and he lived adjacent to his family farm.  It had a hugely detrimental impact on the family.  I was a county councillor at the time and I made representations to the HSE, but I was stonewalled and received no answers either oral or written.<\/p> <p> When the gentleman was subsequently made a ward of court, the HSE, through the wardship process, initiated proceedings to sell his land.  He had 50 acres of land.  Again, there was no discussion with the family.  It was on the basis of funding nursing care, even though the gentleman did not want to be there and his family did not want him to be there.  Unfortunately, the gentleman passed away in October 2016.  The HSE has put a charge on his property and land and is seeking to cash in on that through his estate.  However, this gentleman was not allowed to be taken home by his family.  The charge is driven by him being in care when there was a family that was fully capable of looking after him.<\/p> <p> When I saw the article to which I refer, it struck a chord with me.  The HSE wrote to me after a query was put to it by the Minister of State's predecessor.  The HSE said that it was the understanding of its staff in the midlands area that it was not appropriate to transfer a person from a care location to another location while a wardship process was happening.  Essentially, the HSE was acting illegally.  It then clarified that, going forward, such a request would be considered on the basis of two criteria - the location of the person where the care would be provided and the necessary risk assessment in preparation.  That is of no value to the family now.  They are very distressed.  I ask the Minister of State for a commitment that he will investigate this fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900032#EE01300","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525887300,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will not comment on the specifics of the case because this is the first time I have become aware of it.  However, I will give the Deputy and the House some general background information on wardships.<\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Government to support older people to remain in their own homes and communities and maintain their independence for as long as possible.  However, there will always be a cohort of people for whom this is not an option, despite the level of support that might be provided to them in their homes, and full-time nursing home care is best suited to meet their care needs.  The nursing homes support scheme, also known as the fair deal, is a means-tested scheme of financial assistance for those who need long-term nursing home care, whereby participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The aim of the scheme is to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  Importantly, people can choose any approved nursing home, provided that it has availability and, of course, that it can cater for their needs.<\/p>  <p>  There are circumstances where people require wardship when they are unable to make key decisions relating to their life choices.  If such action is required, a key occasion will be when a person needs residential care services.  In supporting such decisions and clarifying and resolving the person's finances, there is often a lengthy timescale involved.  The HSE endeavours to support people through this time in the context of the agreement of the ward of courts, by addressing their care needs in the most suitable environment.  In this context, some people will reside in residential care settings while the wardship arrangements are being organised.  In many cases, an application for the nursing homes support scheme for funding to support long-stay care will be the outcome if long-stay care is the most appropriate care to be provided.  The assisted decision-making legislation will provide a new set of arrangements in such cases once commenced and implemented.<\/p>  <p>  While what I have just outlined reflects current practice, the Deputy may be interested to know that the Department of Health is currently drafting legislation to provide clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty in nursing homes and other residential facilities.  The deprivation of liberty safeguards will apply in circumstances in which it is proposed that a relevant person is to live in, or is already living in, a relevant facility and: he or she is or will be under continuous supervision and control; is not, or will not, be free to leave; there is reason to believe that the person lacks capacity to make a decision to live in the relevant facility.  The Department recently carried out a public consultation on its draft legislative proposals and is currently analysing the submissions with a view to amending its draft heads of Bill as necessary.  We intend to undertake this work as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that the system we are developing will work in practice and will provide sufficient safeguards in accordance with the requirements of international law, domestic law and relevant jurisprudence.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015 will ultimately replace the current wards of court system.  This will provide a new set of arrangements once implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900033#FF00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1525887300,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I would be grateful if the Minister of State would confirm that he will investigate this issue or have the Department ask the HSE to conduct a review of the case.  With regard to liberty and freedom in terms of bringing an elderly patient home, it is worrying for me to hear the HSE refer to putting the patient first when it said in correspondence to me that it was only clarified in early 2016, during pressures arising from winter pressures, that patients under the wardship process were allowed to go home.  That is not really putting the patients first in an application process.  Before that, debts were being run up and were being discharged against the patient, as in the case I outlined, and the family was fully capable and had the capacity to look after the individual in question.  In addition, during the period in question, the HSE was not liaising with the family or giving them the key answers.  It was appointing estate agents and auctioneers from the court to sell property to discharge debts when the family felt it could have this person at home.  A number of files were opened up at that time.  I am aware that one report was initiated through the elder abuse officer.  It was fully found to be incorrect in favour of the family.  Again, the family has no redress for that.  It was being stonewalled by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The article I mentioned points out that there is a fundamental issue here.  We like to keep individuals in their homes but when a family has the capacity, setting and qualifications to care for an individual they should be facilitated to do that, rather than the individual being made to stay in a nursing home when a wardship process is under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900033#FF00300","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1525887300,"counter":411,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes a fair, valid and what appears to be a reasonable point.

Deputy Lisa Chambers and I have been approached by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and some of the 12 clients from across County Mayo who use the Castlebar centre on a Monday-to-Friday basis for respite and other services.<\/p><p>From the end of May, this will become a three-day service and no transport will be provided from various parts of the county to the Castlebar centre.  As the Minister of State can imagine, this is causing huge distress to the families of the 12 clients involved, who depend on the service and on the transport to the service, and to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which provides an excellent service, along with Western Alzheimers, across County Mayo.  Over the years, much of the response to Alzheimer's and dementia across County Mayo has been driven by communities, not the HSE.  The HSE has taken on board some of the projects but has cut funding to other projects, leading to a very bumpy service across the county.  What has happened in all these instances is that the patients who were using the community services, which were subsequently cut, and their families were then forced into either primary care providers across the county or Mayo University Hospital, thereby adding pressure to an already overstretched system.<\/p> <p> In respect of the Castlebar centre, there is a shortfall of only some &euro;30,000 annually.  The HSE has not increased funding to the centre for a number of years.  The clients contribute over &euro;13,000 a year to the five-day service and the transport, with the HSE contributing just over &euro;34,000 and fundraising led by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland just under &euro;33,000.  For want of this relatively small amount of money, which can be found within the budget, this service, this lifeline to families, and this transport will be restricted to three days and possibly to an even greater extent.  The Alzheimer Society of Ireland has endeavoured for some years to try to engage the HSE on this issue.  The HSE has written to both Deputy Lisa Chambers and me to tell us it is not cutting funding this year.  However, the difficulty is that it is not increasing it either and the costs of providing the service are increasing.  Transport alone has seen an increase in insurance costs.  In addition, three people who have a relationship with the clients involved and whose relationship with the families of these clients is absolutely essential to the clients' well-being will be laid off this project.  It is beyond me how a small, community-led service which is providing such a difference will now be curtailed in this manner because of a refusal on the part of the HSE to engage in the practical realities and practical, day-to-day expenses involved.  This has happened previously.  There was a wonderful project called Community Action on Dementia in Mayo, a community-led response project, which was providing a fantastic service.  It had its money curtailed because the HSE took a decision locally not to support it.  The services it provided were phenomenal.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to engage with the HSE.  It does not seem to understand the damage it is doing or the short-sighted nature of the decision it is taking.  For the want of &euro;30,000-odd, these 12 people will be put on a three-day service, thereby adding pressure to our primary care services and to Mayo University Hospital, which cannot stand any more pressure than that which it already faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900033#FF00600","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525887900,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary for raising this issue.  Some 55,000 people in Ireland have dementia, and this number is expected to increase to 157,000 by 2046 as the number of older people in Ireland increases.  The national dementia strategy emphasises that, with the right supports, people with dementia can continue to live well and participate in their own communities for a long lime.<\/p>  <p>  A &euro;27.5 million national dementia strategy implementation programme is being implemented.  This includes dementia-specific intensive home care packages, a dementia information and awareness campaign called Understand Together and a programme to upskill GPs and primary care teams in dementia diagnosis and management.  The HSE's National Dementia Office is undertaking numerous projects to progress the implementation of other strands of the strategy, including in the areas of dementia diagnosis, post-diagnostic support and acute hospital care.<\/p>  <p>  Social care services are an important component of enabling people with dementia to remain living at home and participating in their own homes and communities.  They also provide valuable supports to carers.  The HSE, the National Dementia Office and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland have undertaken a project to identify what dementia-specific services are available in communities across Ireland and the results of this have been made available through an online service finder.  In addition, the National Dementia Office and the HSE are working to identify the generic services that people with dementia access.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the specific issue of the day care centre in Castlebar, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, ASI, receives annual funding from the HSE to provide services and supports in Mayo to people with dementia, their families and carers.  These services are in addition to supports provided directly by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Since its opening in 2006, the Alzheimer's day centre in Castlebar has offered a valuable service to people with dementia and their families and carers in Castlebar and the surrounding areas.  The hard work of the centre's staff and volunteers has allowed people with dementia to remain living in their own communities with dignity and respect.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland have been engaging on the issue of service and funding in respect of this centre.  The level of funding provided by the HSE to the ASI for this service in 2018 is the same as it was in 2017.  However, due to an existing financial deficit, the ASI has informed the HSE that it cannot deliver the existing level of service without additional funding.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, the HSE is unable to provide additional allocations to this individual service as the HSE must operate within the resources available to it.  While all community health organisations endeavour to support such services in their areas as much as possible, they must do so within the context of the budgetary resources that exist.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE understands the disappointment of people with dementia and their families who avail of the day care centre in Castlebar.  Nonetheless, the centre will continue to operate for three days per week and provide services to clients during those days.  I wish to emphasise that my Department aims to implement the national dementia strategy in full and ensure the provision of services to support and meet the needs of people with dementia and their families throughout the country, including in County Mayo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900034#GG00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1525887900,"counter":416,"content":"<p>That is an incredibly cold response on the part of the HSE.  I know it is not the Minister of State's response or his feeling on the matter.  One cannot just dispatch people from a five-day service to a three-day service.  One cannot speak about a national dementia strategy and people in communities and then cut their service in this manner, give them a pat on the head and hope they will not be affected.  They will be affected.  The HSE funds Alzheimer Society of Ireland services to an average of approximately 63%, but the Castlebar-based service is getting 31% funding, so there is a major gap in the funding level.  As I said, it is a relatively small amount, and it is within the HSE's gift.  Considering the amount of money it spends and wastes in many areas, it could find this money and deliver it to maintain the five-day service.  The biggest impact of a lack of funding would be the complete exclusion of transport on the other two days.  Clients will be faced with a reduction from a five to a three-day service but will actually not be able to get to the service because their families will not be in a position to bring them to Castlebar and back on the two other days.  There is therefore the cut from the five-day to the three-day service and the complete cut in transport.  The service is being undermined entirely and all the HSE can say is, \"Tough.  There is nothing we can do about it.\"  This is a consistent response.  The Minister of State can speak about a national dementia strategy but these are community-led and community-based initiatives that are keeping people in their communities and, more importantly, at home and they face small, penurious cuts in funding.  It is typical of the HSE's approach, which is penny wise and pound foolish.

I am glad that the T&aacute;naiste is present.<\/p>  <p>  Many people in Gaza will watch the recording of this debate.  The elected representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council in Gaza have specifically asked that statements be made in the run up to the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, the events in 1948 when over 1 million Palestinians were ethnically cleansed and displaced from their lands.  It was an event which marked the beginning of 70 years of tragedy, displacement, exile, dispossession, occupation and oppression for the people of Palestine that continues today and we witness in all its horror with 45 unarmed protestors, many young people, some as young as 14 years - one young man on his 14th birthday - killed by Israeli snipers in what can only be described as the cold-blooded execution of unarmed protestors.<\/p>  <p>  These are protestors who have been marching to vindicate their rights under international law.  I refer specifically to UN resolution 194, which gives people who have been ethnically cleansed or displaced from their homes the right to return.  That has been denied to them for 70 years.  In the case of Gaza, it has lead to a horrific humanitarian catastrophe since the imposition of a brutal siege by Israel that has been going on for 11 years.  It prevents basic goods being brought into Gaza, a tiny area of land in which 2 million people live and which has been subjected to four savage Israeli military assaults against a largely defenceless population.<\/p>  <p>  It is critically important that we speak up for the Palestinians and their plight, particularly in view of what has been visited on them in recent weeks and is likely to continue in coming weeks in the lead-up to the anniversary on 15 May.  We must speak out and do something, we cannot just condemn.  I have heard the T&aacute;naiste and, indeed, the Taoiseach condemn what is happening.  However, we need to do something for people who are suffering intolerably and unjustly.<\/p>  <p>  One thing we can do, and which we have been asked to do, is something I have raised previously with the T&aacute;naiste.  The Palestinian Legislative Council has invited representatives  from the various parties in this Parliament to go to Gaza - they are not asking for the Government to send representatives, although they would be very glad if the Government were to so do officially - and meet all groups, specifically the members of the elected parliament there.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, at the heart of what is happening in Gaza is Israel's refusal - and, tragically, that of much of the international community - to recognise  the outcome of a democratic election.  That is what started this and the suffering continues because of it.  I ask that we do something.  Sanctions should be imposed on Israel for its flagrant breaches of international law and human rights.  If, however, we do not impose sanctions, can we at least sent an all-party group there to witness what is happening and to meet and talk to everybody over there, specifically the elected representatives in Gaza, in order that we can point a way out of this horrific conflict?  I hope to get a positive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900035#HH00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1525888500,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue - not for the first time - and I am happy to be here to respond because it is one about which I am also greatly concerned.  I have been particularly concerned in recent weeks due to the appalling number of serious injuries and deaths among people engaged in demonstrations.  To date, 47 Palestinians are reported to have been killed and 1,500 injured.  Some of those shot may have been trying to cross the border fence but, clearly, many - or most - were some distance inside Gaza and posing no immediate threat.  There are at least some cases where the persons shot seem to have been readily identifiable as children or as journalists reporting on the events.<\/p>  <p>  Every country is entitled to defend its territory but international law clearly defines the circumstances in which force, particularly deadly force, can be used against civilians.  Such force must only be used in cases of real and immediate threat to life, and only as a last resort, that is, when other methods have failed.  The use of force should also be proportionate to the threat posed.  I am not satisfied that these limits have been respected.<\/p>  <p>  Israel is fully entitled to be vigilant and cautious when there are mass demonstrations close to its border with Gaza.  However, Palestinians also have a right to protest.  The use of live ammunition is not a normal approach to crowd control and the resulting number and nature of casualties in recent weeks has been shocking.  Many of the injuries from live ammunition have been severe and life-changing, and many people have been killed.<\/p>  <p>  I made two public statements regarding these incidents on 31 March and 9 April.  I called on all sides to show restraint, particularly Israel in its use of force.  Everyone needs to take responsibility to ensure young people particularly are not placed in harm&rsquo;s way.  I have also supported the calls by the EU and the UN Secretary General for an independent and transparent investigation into these events.  I have expressed these concerns directly to the Israeli ambassador and our ambassador in Israel has conveyed my views to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.<\/p>  <p>  The intensity of the clashes has decreased somewhat in recent weeks.  However, with the cycle of protests in Gaza scheduled to culminate in the middle of this month, that is, next week, I am deeply concerned about the prospect of further casualties.  I call on all parties, particularly Israel, to show restraint and to avoid confrontation.  We should remember that next week will also see the official opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem, which will add further fuel to this fire.<\/p>  <p>  I would also stress the wider context in which these events have occurred.  As I have made clear in all my contacts in the region, the situation in Gaza is untenable.  If the cycle of violence and depression in the Gaza Strip is not ended, we know that events of this nature will recur.  The long-standing blockade cannot be accepted as normal.  It is for this reason that, in my many contacts at EU and international level, I have been particularly active in trying to encourage and promote international engagement on improving life in Gaza, which I visited in January on my second journey there.  I have made this a priority in my work as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It will continue to be a priority.  If people have practical suggestions for how we can assist, I will listen to them.<\/p>  <p>  This year, we are increasing our spend significantly towards supporting Palestinians.  One project that we are supporting is a very large solar energy project to power a water purification plant in Gaza in order to try to improve the quality of life there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900035#HH00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1525888500,"counter":421,"content":"<p>People in Gaza will appreciate much of what the T&aacute;naiste said.

It most certainly does not justify shooting down people on unarmed protests.<\/p> <p> The question is, what are we going to do about it?  Unless sanctions are imposed on Israel it will be indifferent.  The decision by Mr. Trump to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem is a direct provocation.  What are we going to do?  I am making a very simple request and I would appreciate a response to it from the Minister.  The representatives elected democratically in free and fair elections in Gaza, whom Israel and the Americans refuse to recognise, ask that we send an all-party delegation not to meet Hamas specifically, but to meet all groups, including the elected representatives of their parliament, in order to hear what they have to say and to look at that destruction so that we can point in the direction which will allow for peace, which is through engagement and discussion, not through the brutality displayed by Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900035#HH00600","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525889100,"counter":425,"content":"<p>First, the Deputy asked what these people can do.

That could mean removing a blockade, trying to improve living conditions or making sure that in the medium term, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, UNWRA, keeps the funding it needs.  Approximately 70% of the people in Gaza rely on UNWRA for some form of food support or healthcare.

As Members will be aware, this legislation was introduced to the House by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, on 21 February last.  I commend Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Jack Chambers, who have been instrumental in moving this legislation forward and bringing it to Second Stage here today.<\/p>  <p>  It is instructive to note that the legislation dealing with gambling in Ireland dates back to the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  That reveals the extent to which the current laws governing gambling are archaic.  I do not believe that anyone in this House believes that the laws do not need to be updated or that new regulations do not need to be introduced.  Any person who travels around Ireland will know that gambling is a very substantial and significant business.  Most small towns and, indeed, large towns have many bookies' shops and there is also the opportunity for people to gamble online.  It is a business that has an enormous turnover and there are significant profits from it.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to note at the outset that Fianna F&aacute;il fully recognises that many people in Ireland enjoy themselves gambling.  They do not have a problem in respect of gambling.  They like to bet on a horse or a football match.  It provides entertainment and does not have any negative consequences for them, other than losing small amounts of money.  However, that ignores the fact that many people in this country have significant gambling addictions.  It is important, and the responsibility of this House, to ensure that legislation is introduced to provide some assistance for those individuals.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to introducing any legislation it is important that we look at the available research dealing with the particular social area we are trying to regulate.  We have done this prior to introducing this legislation.  Research was conducted in June 2015 by an academic in University College Dublin, Dr. Crystal Fulton, and it indicates there is a significant problem with gambling addiction in Ireland.  Research carried out by GambleAware, which was referred to in the research I just mentioned, shows that an estimated 28,000 to 40,000 people in Ireland suffer from a gambling disorder.  That is a huge number of people.  We also know from international research that single men under the age of 35 are particularly affected by gambling addiction.  That is a cohort of individuals in our society for which we need to do something.  Many individuals - men between the ages of 20 and 35 - have significant social problems, one of which is gambling.  It is simply irresponsible of this House to ignore that problem and not to try to regulate the area.<\/p>  <p>  We all know individuals who have suffered from gambling addictions.  In many respects, gambling addiction is no different from any other addiction, such as a drug or alcohol addiction.  It can and does have a devastating impact on individuals' relationships.  It can have devastating impacts on marriages, on friendships and on other family relationships.  It also results in people's behaviour becoming very erratic.  It has all the hallmarks of a symptom which requires proper treatment.  In fact, it could nearly be diagnosed as a particular condition that requires expert treatment in the future.<\/p>  <p>  We need to recognise that it is unacceptable not to have tried to regulate this area for so long.  The problems in respect of gambling are now even more severe because of the arrival of technology.  It used to be the case that people who had gambling problems would have to go to the bookie's shop and the worst that would happen was that they would devote and spend all the money in their pockets to gambling and that they would lose that money.  Now problems are much more significant.  People have access to gambling online and on their mobile phones.  They are not just limited to losing the money they have in the bank account.  They are now exposed to the prospect of losing money that they have borrowed or that is on account - money they do not have but for which they will be responsible when their debts come in and when the bill comes in from the bookie.  <\/p>  <p>  I say this with no disrespect to bookies but the bookie always wins and it is the case that an individual who is devoting his or her life to gambling inevitably will suffer from severe financial loss.  Therefore, what we seek to do in this legislation is to provide regulation for this area in Irish life.  We want to ensure that gambling in Ireland is properly regulated, that vulnerable people are properly protected and that the business itself is fully regulated in order that ordinary individuals who want to be involved in gambling can know that they are doing so in an orthodox and regulated way.  We think it is very important that this legislation gets through this House as promptly as possible and that we get a regulatory system in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900036#JJ00800","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525889700,"counter":432,"content":"<p>As my colleague mentioned, problem gambling has spiralled out of control.  Thousands of lives have been ruined by a failure to regulate the gambling sector.  I refer to families destroyed by lies, homes taken away because of massive debts and lives lost because of depression and suicide.  We have 1930s-era laws for 2018 problems.  When the current rules to control the gambling sector were drafted, most of the country did not even have electricity, never mind the Internet, mobile phones, instant gaming and 24-hour access to betting and gambling.  This is how ludicrously far we have fallen behind.  Decades of inaction and can-kicking have sowed chaos.  It is a wild-west sector that has been left to regulate itself and play by its own rules.<\/p>  <p>  Inaction has created a landscape whereby vulnerable people are at the mercy of multibillion euro profit-making corporations &ndash; a landscape where someone can gamble and lose &euro;460,000 in 12 hours and where the only contact he receives in that period is a telephone call from the bookmaker to tell him the computer systems are down and to call him personally if he wants to place another bet.  That is not acceptable in modern Ireland.  The result of inaction has been devastating and the results are plain to see.  We have the third highest rate of gambling losses in the world.  Gambling losses in Ireland totalled &euro;2.1 billion in 2016.  Some &euro;14 million is gambled every day.  The sector's biggest firms predict &euro;400 million and &euro;500 million surpluses every year.  The industry-touted figure is that there are approximately 40,000 problem gamblers in Ireland.  The Institute of Public Health in Ireland puts the figure at over 100,000.  Treatment centres and addiction counselling services tell us that for every one gambling addict, ten lives are affected.  This means that we have allowed gambling to spiral so far out of control, it could be affecting up to 1 million people.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation, if enacted, will be successful in restoring control to the sector and helping problem gamblers.  The key aspect of the Bill is that it is adaptive and flexible and will be able to respond and react, as required, through an office for gambling regulation that will be fully empowered and well resourced.  This is needed to stay on top of an ever-changing industry, which is moving from dimly lit betting shops to behind computer screens and mobile phones, on which the chance to win is always within touching distance, 24-7.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill draws a lot of what was first proposed in heads of a Bill in 2013.  It is disappointing that we have wasted the time since 2013 and that new legislation is only now being introduced.  This Bill is not out of date, however, and was recently scrutinised by Dr. Crystal Fulton, who found that it is suitable, subject to minor changes.  Amendments, as required, can be considered on Committee Stage, and we hope to work with the Government and all the other political parties on that.  It is in keeping with what has happened in other countries.  The UK, Spain, Australia, Sweden and Canada all have gambling regulatory authorities similar to the one proposed.  This Bill is almost 100 pages long and contains eight sections that cover everything from licensing and codes of practice to tackling money-laundering and international co-operation.  It includes the establishment of a social fund to support problem gamblers and the introduction of better staff training to identify problems.  In addition, it would impose strict age restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Another very important aspect of the Bill is a new self-exclusion registrar to operate across platforms where people can affectively opt out of gambling for a time.  This registrar could be overseen by the regulator's office and would be crucial to someone who self-identifies as having a problem and is taking the extra step to get the help and support he needs.<\/p>  <p>  I thank and pay tribute to my colleagues, Deputies Rabbitte and O'Callaghan, along with Mr. Kevin Dillon in the research office, for their work in drafting this Bill.  I thank Mr. Barry Grant from Problem Gambling Ireland for his work in this area and the Rutland Centre and Cuan Mhuire treatment centres for their help and support.  Mr. Tony O'Reilly and Mr. Davy Glennon both gave powerful testimonies in the audiovisual room last week and they deserve great credit for outlining how, having struggled, they overcame their addictions.<\/p>  <p>  The experiences of those who have been victims of legislative inaction must be learned from and used for the better.  The industry also has a role to play.  We understand that it is largely supportive of the proposed law.  It should work to see this legislation facilitated and progressed.  It should not replicate the actions of some in the alcohol industry in trying to block and impede legislation.  It is important that the Bill moves forward with urgency.  We need to restore control in what is a wild-west sector.  The Minister of State, as a former Chairman of the justice committee, is genuine about seeing gambling regulations progressed.  We look forward to working with him in the interest of addicts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900037#KK00100","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1525889700,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I commend Deputies Rabbitte, Jack Chambers and O'Callaghan on their work in bringing forward this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Government really has a lot to answer for.  Fine Gael has been in government for seven years and there has been no decisive action.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, might be personally committed to this, there is a blockage somewhere, be it in the system or in strands of industry.  The industry in general tells us it is supportive but nothing has happened.  There has to be accountability for that.  We need to have some answers as to why what is happening is the case.<\/p>  <p>  As has been said already, problem gambling destroys lives.  That has to be the starting point in this debate.  We all need to recognise and accept that fact.  The impact is not only on the person with an addiction but, as has been stated, it is also on those around that individual.  The reality is that the opportunity to gamble is now in one's face constantly.  One can gamble on anything.  One can place a bet on which of two flies walking up the wall will win the race.  Those of us who enjoy sport, watch sport on television or watch Sky Sports - this is beyond the control of the Government - are bombarded with messages about gambling on advertising hoardings and during the intervals and advertising breaks.  Flagship sponsors of shows promote gambling.  It is incessant and omnipresent and we really have to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, the whole system has changed.  It is now so easy to gamble.  In the past, one had to walk into a bookmaker's to place one's bet.  There was some constraint on how much one could bet given how much money one had.  We need a gambling authority.  It has to have real teeth and powers.  We have to place real emphasis on training and education.  We need serious restrictions with appropriate penalties attached in respect of age, advertising, promotions and sponsorship.  All of this needs to be led by a gambling authority.  It has to happen and the Minister of State needs to deliver it.  We have to look close to home also.  We have our own national lottery regulator, yet we now have 51 lottery games, eight draw options, 24 online games and 19 scratch cards.  Does our own national lottery system need 51 games?

I had occasion to speak to a recently qualified counsellor who has just started working in his first job.  He told me of his surprise at the number of young men his own age who are seeking help for gambling addiction.  These men started gambling insignificant sums of money on gaming websites and the problem very quickly spiralled out of control, leaving them with serious financial and mental health problems.<\/p><p>Young people are using new online gambling facilities at a really disturbing rate, creating a whole new generation of addicts.

He attended a Gamblers Anonymous meeting at Cuan Mhuire in Athy and described how helpful that service was in helping him to quit gambling.  What worried me about what he said was how easy it was for him to access so-called members-only gambling facilities despite not being a member.  On his Twitter page, he advocates strongly for the passage of this Bill, as does Mr. Tony O'Reilly, the man behind the theft of &euro;1.75 million from An Post to fuel his own gambling addiction.  He says the &quot;epidemic - particularly of online gambling - is happening all around us, with thousands of people suffering both directly and indirectly.&quot;  One way forward, he says, is for the 2013 gambling Bill to be enacted.  He states, &quot;If this can be achieved, it could help so many who are struggling with a gambling addiction and may even stop some from falling over that cliff.&quot;  After five years of delay, action must be taken immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900037#KK00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1525890300,"counter":435,"content":"<p>To cut to the chase, it is an accepted truth that gambling is a disease for many and that it has infiltrated and destroyed many lives in this country.  No attempt is being made tonight to ban gambling but an attempt is being made to try, in some small way, to halt the terrible damage being done to the lives of people who are addicted to this scourge and to end the relentless march that bookies and the wider industry are on to further tighten their grip on the consciousness of society.  The key here is how the gambling industry is gaining a tighter grip on people's minds through advertising and social media platforms.  People need to stand up to those practices.<\/p><p>Last year, at a special night at my GAA club, Navan O'Mahonys, the executive invited GAA legend Ois&iacute;n McConville to talk about his own battles with gambling addiction.  As a GAA man, it was desperately sad to listen to one of our great stars talk about how he went to London for an operation and, after coming out, spent the evening in the bookies.  He gambled every penny he had and could not even afford the taxi back to the airport.  He had to run to Heathrow and aggravated the injury for which he had been treated.  That is the stranglehold gambling can have over a person.  The question is then whether it is a lost battle.  I asked a good friend of mine who is an addict and who may never break the addiction - but who keeps fighting it - whether the battle is lost.  He said that I should not let the industry get a further stranglehold on people.  I am looking at the path they want to take.  Let us not confuse what is being said this evening as an attempt to thwart the fun of people who go to the races for a for a day with their friends.  I attended the Sligo races last Sunday.  I enjoyed a great day at that scenic racecourse and, courtesy of Noel Meade, my local trainer, I backed a winner.  There is a big difference between that and a bookie who is trying to get one to lump money on Swansea - via one's mobile phone - after Southampton have scored, with the advance of in-match betting and the odds flashing up on the screens around the ground.  I would encourage anyone to read the feature on the Paddy Power CEO, Peter Jackson, in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>last weekend to see where these guys want to go to infiltrate society even further.<\/p><p>One of the great things in Irish sport is the cheer that goes up from the crowd at 1.30 p.m. on the Tuesday of Cheltenham Festival week but if one walks around the bookie shops in Navan or any other provincial town at 5.30 p.m. on the same day, it is easy to see the impact of the sport of kings on so many poor souls.  The flashing television advertisements of Ruby Walsh and Paddy Power will not pay the food bills of the lads who handed all their money for the day across the counter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900038#LL00100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1525890300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>We all know that there are people who can enjoy an odd flutter at the races.  However, there are others who cannot limit their betting to a day at the races or a night at the dogs.  These people are classified as problem gamblers.  According to a recent UCD study, there are over 40,000 people in Ireland with gambling addictions, with single men under 35 most at risk.  This is very much a silent addiction which can escalate and get out of control very quickly.  If one is a problem gambler with an online betting account that has no spending limit, one can literally throw away thousands of euro a day.  The majority of online gambling accounts will be set up with a debit or credit card.  It takes seconds to transfer money and place a bet.  This is lethal for a problem gambler.  The most vulnerable people we need to protect are those who sit at home alone on Saturdays and Sundays, when there is sport on all day, glued to their laptops, tablets or phones and feeding money into their accounts in order to place bets.  They are not physically handing over cold hard cash as they do in the shops and at the races.  This takes the sense of reality out of online gambling.  They are effectively playing with Monopoly money and do not realise the gravity of their losses until it is too late.<\/p>  <p>  Advertisements and sports sponsorships for cigarettes and alcohol are heavily regulated and almost non-existent these days.  It is time for the sports industry to get its act together with regard to gambling.  I challenge Deputies on the Government benches to take note of the television advertisements the next time they are watching a high profile sporting event.  Every second or third advert is for a betting company, usually online.  Sports websites and the sports editors of our print media must also take note of their moral responsibility in this regard.  If I am a recovering gambling addict and I sit down to watch a match, read the sports pages of a newspaper or catch up on a sports website, I am bombarded by betting advertisements which could cause a relapse.  We need effective regulation for this industry to give those who work in the sector certainty through socially responsible gambling.  We are committed to working with the industry to build this new framework but the time for delays has long since passed.  Legislative action is now needed.  We cannot underestimate the dangers of gambling addiction for young people.  I ask the Minister of State to take this on board.

The Government is not opposing the Private Member's Bill sponsored by Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan, Jack Chambers and Rabbitte.  However, we are debating a Government general scheme of a gambling control Bill, published in 2013, which the proposers have essentially replicated.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The guiding principle of the 2013 scheme is that only gambling activities which are licensed and regulated would be lawful.  Only the regulatory body might issue licences for such activities.  The licensing principles would apply equally to both land-based services, such as bookmakers&rsquo; premises, gaming arcades, etc., and remote services online, on mobile devices and so forth.  Applicants for gambling licenses would be required to supply detailed information, including evidence of financial viability, criminal records and staff training.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities would have statutory rights to comment on and to oppose where necessary any application for a licence for reasons within their competences.<\/p>  <p>  The regulation of the national lottery was excluded from the scope of the 2013 Government scheme and is at present a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I note what colleagues have said about the national lottery.  This debate provides me with the opportunity to report to the D&aacute;il on the work under way to review and enhance the original Government proposals, as set down in the 2013 scheme, and to take account of technological and other developments that have occurred in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  As colleagues have said, this is a fast-moving area.  The development of modern, fit-for-purpose, gambling legislation is necessary and is a priority for Government.  The objective must be to ensure the proper licensing and regulation of the many varied forms of gambling now available in the State, including traditional betting on horse and dog racing, gaming machines, casinos, lotteries and online gambling, including the increasingly popular virtual and fantasy-type activities.  We need a modern regulatory approach to a complex multi-billion euro industry that operates increasingly on a global scale.  This revised approach will enhance consumer protection in all forms of gambling, increase the protection of vulnerable persons and potentially increase Exchequer revenue from the gambling industry.<\/p>  <p>  I have been actively engaged in efforts to develop and bring forward revised proposals in this complex and evolving area of policy based on the 2013 Government scheme.  I acknowledge comments attributed to me by colleagues across the House.  The establishment of a dedicated gambling policy division in the Department of Justice and Equality in January 2017 has facilitated this review.  The division also asked for submissions from stakeholders and members of the public setting out their ideas for better regulation.  Of significant importance is that the Government, on 10 January last, approved my proposal to review, modernise and revise the 2013 general scheme of the gambling control Bill.  Many changes have taken place since 2013.  The critical changes approved were to establish an independent regulatory authority for the gambling industry, rationalise the licensing approach to gambling activities, clarify the provisions concerning the licensing of gaming machines, and review all provisions to determine if they remained fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  The key element of the Government decision of 10 January 2018 is the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality.  This approach to independent regulation is, I believe, critical for the development of modern gambling legislation.  It mirrors the situation in most EU member states and would bring Ireland into line with best international practice.  An independent regulator would offer assurance that decision-making would be free from any potentially undue influence.  I should also point out to Deputies that effective modern licensing, regulation and enforcement of the gambling industry will require significant additional resources, primarily for the operation of the new regulatory authority.  Similar authorities in other EU member states involve significant staff numbers and IT provision.  However, there is increased potential revenue for the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has agreed that there may be a need for the further development of an appropriate licensing, monitoring and enforcement regime for land-based gaming machines in casinos or elsewhere that may be played for monetary reward.  The new authority would have the responsibility to license these machines and licensing terms and conditions would be developed with regard to locations, numbers, stakes, prize amounts, etc.  Licensing conditions must be clear, fair, legitimate and transparent to all.  It would not be realistic to seek to enforce prohibition on certain physical gaming machines over other types of machine.  This would risk further migration to online versions, which are widely available on most operators' websites and may be difficult to monitor effectively.  Any discriminatory licensing approaches to gaming machines that differ little, if at all, might attract legal challenge by operators or the regulatory attention of the European Commission.  In this regard, I am investigating whether only one standard type of machine, capable of being monitored interactively, might be the ultimate solution to the reported proliferation of different types of machines, some of which are very old.<\/p>  <p>  To progress the review and updating of the general scheme in all necessary aspects, a working group was established, comprising all key stakeholder Departments, relevant offices and the Office of the Attorney General, which I chair.  This group had its first meeting in February 2018.  It has met on a number of occasions to date and will continue to meet.<\/p><p>This work will assist in identifying new or emerging legislative and policy issues not currently represented in the original general scheme and which may need to be addressed in new legislation.  It is my expectation that the working group will submit a final report to Government in mid to late 2018.<\/p> <p> The 2013 scheme contained provisions with regard to regulating advertising, promotions, special offers and sponsorship of events by gambling operators.  In particular, activities aimed at those under 18 years of age or vulnerable persons were to be prevented.  These provisions need to be revisited in the light of developments, technological and otherwise, since 2013.  Gambling advertising and promotions are now increasingly individually targeted using new technology.  Potential restrictions on gambling advertising and sponsorship must be carefully considered, targeted and effective.  Sectors of Irish sporting activity that depend heavily on advertising and sponsorship risk being negatively impacted by very restrictive measures.  For example, advertising by gambling companies is very much prevalent in TV coverage of horse racing from Irish racecourses and is a significant source of income that is not easily replaced.  There is significant sponsorship of sporting events by gambling companies, for example, UK Premiership football, major races in both the UK and Ireland and the Irish soccer team's home games.  The national lottery is a very prominent and significant prominent gambling advertiser and sponsor.<\/p> <p> Our legislation must include measures to deal with aggressive promotional offers by gambling operators to entice customers to their product.  However, I am anxious to ensure that unintended negative consequences do not arise in this regard and I must caution against unrealistic expectations as to what can be achieved.  Imposing restrictions on out-of-State broadcasters or sporting events broadcast from abroad would be difficult, as would seeking to restrict advertising online.<\/p> <p> Another area that will require our further attention is what conditions should attach to the licensing of casinos.  Ireland will be the last EU member state to introduce formal legislation regulating casinos.  In this regard, consideration of the issue of licensing casinos cannot be limited solely to land-based casinos.  Many casino games are now available for play online.  Technological advances now permit players to bet in virtual reality casinos online without the need to leave their homes.  <\/p> <p> I am sure that much of this evening's discussion will rightly centre on the issue of problem gambling and gambling addiction.  A modem and effectively regulated gambling environment will ensure to the greatest extent possible that gambling will be an entertaining activity for the majority of those who take part in it.  We must ensure that it will provide enhanced consumer protection for players while limiting the harmful effects on those who may be susceptible to addiction or other such problems and protecting young people.  The safeguard proposals in the 2013 scheme will require development and continuous monitoring thereafter.  In this context, the new independent regulatory authority will be the critical factor.<\/p> <p> There are no definitive statistics available that indicate the extent of gambling addiction in Ireland.  The Department of Justice and Equality is awaiting the publication of information from the 2014-15 national advisory committee on drugs and alcohol drug and gambling prevalence survey that contained a number of questions on gambling habits and prevalence.  The Department will support a further, more detailed study to be conducted by the Health Research Board from 2018 to 2019.  These studies will contribute to our policy debate and the development of appropriate measures to prevent and to treat gambling addiction.<\/p> <p> Our focus must be to develop the best possible regulatory measures for the gambling industry in respect of vulnerable persons.  These would include age restrictions, staff training, self-exclusion measures and controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.  I envisage the regulatory authority undertaking public education and awareness-raising programmes to promote socially responsible gambling and assist in counteracting the ill effects for players, their families and society of irresponsible or problem gambling.  A key potential of new effective regulation is that it will permit the establishment and operation of a social fund supported by industry levies.  Such a fund will support those professional and expert organisations involved in addiction treatment.<\/p> <p> As well as being concerned with protecting vulnerable persons at risk of addiction, I am also conscious from representations made to my Department that there must be enhanced consumer protection measures for persons engaging in gambling.  I envisage these including ensuring licensed operators have adequate financial resources and publish clear terms and conditions of business and a new complaints and compensation procedure.  A critical change proposed in 2013 is a revision of the centuries old public and statutory policy to make gambling wagers or bets contractually enforceable concerning licensed gambling activities.  This has occurred in the UK and elsewhere but only for licensed gambling activities.<\/p> <p> I would be happy to receive realistic proposals from Deputies that would contribute to the updating of the 2013 general scheme and bring about as soon as possible the development of modern and effective legislation.  New modern gambling legislation, in conjunction with independent regulation, offers the best route to enhanced consumer protection, to increased Exchequer revenue from the industry and to the development of a full range of treatment and mediation methods to address problem gambling by those agencies competent in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900038#LL00300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525890900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>T&aacute; seans ann go rachaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh beag&aacute;in&iacute;n n&iacute;os faide n&aacute; 15 bhomaite.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam faoi na daoine eile.  I commend Deputies Jim O'Callaghan, Jack Chambers and Anne Rabbitte for this timely and important legislation.  Our betting legislation is from the 1930s and 1950s and has been out of date for a long time.  I note what the Minister of State said and it is welcome that the Bill is not being opposed.  However, his speech contained the statement that the Government is debating a Government general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill published in 2013, which the proposers have essentially replicated.  It is not that we have been dealing with a succession of Governments since 2013.  It has essentially been the same Government.  We have seen very little progress on this issue and very little explanation even in the Minister of State's speech.  The fact that there has been very little explanation as to why there has been so little progress with this legislation was raised by a number of Deputies.  The former Minister, Alan Shatter, brought forward heads of Bill which broadly speaking were relatively progressive but since then, it has sat on the shelf.  It is difficult to understand why this has happened.  Reference has been made to whether there was opposition in the Department, the industry or sectors of the industry.  Why has there been no progress on this Bill because it seems a no-brainer to me that this society should acknowledge the enormous issue surrounding gambling in this country?  Deputies are all too familiar with the devastation caused to families by addiction.<\/p>  <p>  As other Deputies have said, it is fair to say that there is nothing necessarily wrong with having a bet but much like alcohol, it needs to be done in moderation, if at all.  We are perhaps more conscious of the harm done by alcohol and cigarettes and restrictions have been placed on alcohol and there are health warnings and legislation relating to its abuse.  There is a greater attempt to tackle cultural attitudes around its abuse and misuse.  We certainly have a long road to travel but there has been some progress.  I do not believe this has been replicated with gambling.  The impact of it is enormous and extends far beyond the individual who suffers from addiction.  A person can spend everything in their bank account, overdraw and lose everything they have.  In particular, the case of Tony O'Reilly is in the public consciousness at the minute.  It is quite difficult to fathom for anybody who has not suffered that addiction but it is important to understand it as an addiction and affliction.  That case, the scale of the problems people can get into and the devastation it can cause families are replicated throughout the country.  In many cases, it is an addiction that is less visible than drug or alcohol abuse.  It is fair to say that it is ever-present.  It has always created problems in terms of addiction but it has never been as visible as it is now with the opportunities that exist and advertising, whether one is watching something on television or online.  There are probably more teams in the UK Premiership sponsored by gambling companies than there are parties in this House and that is saying something.<\/p>  <p>  The general scheme was essentially an outline of what was to be included in the Bill so I would like to hear the Minister of State tell us the explanation for the delay and the progress being made.  When this was scheduled, I had a quick look at what the Government had been saying or doing on this topic over the past few years.  There has been announcement after announcement in response to any issues that have arisen and always a hat tip to this general scheme.  The Minister of State should outline what is the resistance.<\/p>  <p>  I make one point regarding the structure of the Bill.  It proposes to place what would be a very welcome office of gambling control under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I think there are views that it should be an independent Vote so that it would make the case directly to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is a case for that.  It is important that an office is placed on an independent footing outside of political and lobbying influence enabling it to do its job independent of any lobbying or pressure.<\/p><p>Very often with moves to regulate not just gambling, but things such as alcohol, the regular refrain is the implication for jobs, the implication for the Exchequer and so on.  That is political pressure that can be brought to bear.  While I do not say they are not real considerations, it is important that the office of gambling control has as its first priority the public good and public health.  Its independence is important for that.<\/p> <p> The proposal for player protection and social funding is interesting and is certainly workable.  It could have any amount of uses.  In all these things it is important that the playing field is as level as possible for all different sectors.  There could be standardisation of checks for physical betting outlets, casinos and so on.  The social fund could be put to good use there.  It could also be used for public awareness.<\/p> <p> The Bill provides for the creation of a self-exclusion register and sets out rules for advertising promotions and sponsorship.  I presume that is in response to concerns expressed in the media about the increased dangers associated with gambling in an environment that is not fully regulated.  This register would be beneficial if there is common access among similar organisations if it is possible to address that.  It may be a complicated matter but there may be a value in somebody self-excluding and they self-exclude from gambling generally speaking.  I am not sure if that would be workable but it is worthy of consideration.<\/p> <p> As a member of the GAA I commend that organisation on its recent mature decision not to permit teams to use gambling-related advertising.  That is important and shows good leadership.<\/p> <p> The legislation also requires service licence holders to commit resources for funding and operating a scheme for dealing with customer complaints and compensating customers, which is welcome.<\/p> <p> The objectives of the Gambling Control Bill are outlined as ensuring fairness in the conduct of gambling; the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling; and the avoidance of circumstances where gambling could inadvertently or otherwise facilitate or enable criminal or illegal activity and other issues.  That is welcome.<\/p> <p> I make a point I intend to make in tomorrow's debate on the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill.  We need to be conscious that gambling may be used for money laundering and our money laundering legislation needs to take account of that.<\/p> <p> The existing Acts of 1931 and 1953 are absolutely archaic and deal with a completely different time and completely different sector.  Even in recent years the emergence of online gambling means that people can instantaneously transfer funds into a gambling account straight from a bank account at the touch of button.  The current legislation does not reflect the protections we need.  It is an enormous social problem creating very serious situations for individuals and families across the country, absolutely destroying some families.  We have sat on this for too long.  The Bill contains strong proposals and we owe it to the public to act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900039#MM00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525891500,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I commend the Bill's authors on introducing it and giving us an opportunity to have a debate on gambling and more importantly to move the legislation forward.<\/p><p>I wish to unpick the last two paragraphs of the Minister of State's opening speech.  They are very telling and paint a picture of a Government that is not really committed to this and does not believe it will happen anytime soon.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>I would be happy to receive realistic proposals from Deputies that would contribute to the updating of the 2013 general scheme [for a gambling control Bill] and bring about as soon as possible the development of modern and effective legislation.<\/blockquote><p>The Bill before us is essentially a carbon copy of a Bill that was introduced by the Government in the first place.  Therefore there is no reason not to support it.  Is the Minister of State saying the proposals in the Bill introduced by the former Minister, Mr. Shatter, are not realistic?  Is he saying that Bill does not deliver what he called &quot;the development of modern and effective legislation&quot;?  In any event even if he had concerns about any aspect of the Bill, which would be bizarre given that his party introduced the Bill in the first place, these issues can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  That is why his saying he would be happy to receive realistic proposals almost gives the impression that the delay is not on the Government side but because it is not getting co-operation from the Opposition, which is not the case.<\/p><p>The Minister of State went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>New modern gambling legislation, in conjunction with independent regulation, offers the best route to enhanced consumer protection, to increased Exchequer revenue from the industry and to the development of a full range of treatment and mediation methods to address problem gambling by those agencies competent in this area.<\/blockquote><p>There is no quarrel from the Opposition on that.  In reality this is an issue of political will.  If the political will exists, we can get legislation passed.  With the political will we can scrutinise this on Committee Stage to look at the areas of concern either from the Opposition or Government.<\/p><p>What does it mean when the Minister of State says &quot;as soon as possible&quot;?  The previous Bill was proposed in 2013 which is five years ago.  Five years is a long time for a Bill to remain, as many Bills are, in a queue waiting to be advanced by the Government.<\/p><p>We all know that gambling is a very serious issue.  I do not need to remind the Minister or anybody else in the House of the devastation it can cause for individuals and families.  Some people lose everything.  Their bank accounts could be emptied.  They could lose their homes.  Many people have separated and have lost relationships because of gambling.<\/p><p>It is far too easy.  With mobile apps people can bet on the same race on multiple accounts.  There was a time with betting that once a horse race started, that was it.  If someone did not get in, they would often talk about all the bets they did not put on and all the losses they had because they did not bet.  Now it is possible to bet on a race even after it starts.  The same is true of a football match or a soccer match.  I watched the World Snooker Championship final over the weekend.  Even the commentators were giving updates on the changing odds.  Once the game got a bit closer the odds changed and people were betting frame-by-frame.  The same is happening in every sport.  It is far too easy to bet.<\/p><p>I understand that a balance needs to be struck between the public good and people's individual rights.  Some people would make the individual freedom argument that if that is what somebody wants to do, they should be allowed to do it.  As legislators, we have a job to ensure that the public good is also protected.  Sometimes we protect people from themselves because it is not just those individuals who suffer; other people suffer.  The State can suffer if people eventually get mental health problems and need to be supported.  Their families suffer and there are all sorts of consequences.  It is not a victimless act and is not solely contained to the person who is the gambler.  I understand about the balancing of rights here, but I do not believe we have that balance right and we need a regulator.<\/p><p>Recently the Regulator of the National Lottery appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  A huge number of scratch cards costing &euro;5, &euro;10 or &euro;20 are being sold.  There is an issue in that we are making it far too easy to gamble even with scratch cards.  I know of many people who buy multiple scratch cards.  It was grand when they cost &euro;1 or &euro;2; it is very difficult to walk into a shop and ask for 50 scratch cards at &euro;2.  However, it is less of a problem to order five of them at &euro;10.  I have a real difficulty with that.<\/p><p>There is a considerable amount in this Bill, which is a very good Bill.  It has given us a good opportunity to discuss the matter.  Obviously we have some concerns about it, but let us address those on Committee Stage.  If the will exists across the House, we can deliver a Bill within weeks or months.  I am delighted the Minister of State is on board and that we have his personal support, but we need the support of the Government.<\/p><p>This needs to be prioritised.  Let us get a Bill through the House and let us put the regulations and safeguards in place.  Let us make sure that people have an individual right to gamble but also that we have all the appropriate protections, oversight and regulation in place to protect all citizens in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900040#NN00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525892100,"counter":443,"content":"<p>First, I want to state our support for the Bill, on which I believe there is an emerging consensus.  I acknowledge the role of the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, in seeking to push this agenda internally.  His role has to be acknowledged, in particular his bona fides in regard to tackling the downside of gambling, and the need to regulate gambling has been well articulated.<\/p>  <p>  We support the Bill.  One could say that, to a certain extent, the Bill is limited but this is Second Stage and there is a long way to go before the Bill is finalised.  I take on board the points made by the Minister of State and by the originators of the Bill, Deputies Jack Chambers and Anne Rabbitte, and I acknowledge their work on this.  For example, there are issues around technology, in particular how the Bill will legislate for the constant movements and shifts in technology.  Let us suppose there is a well-known betting outfit based in Gibraltar, or somewhere offshore, and it has a presence onshore in Ireland.  If one subscribes to its app, there is evidence it can provide differential odds between different users.  The use of algorithms and technology means there is such fluidity built into the system that it can prove difficult to find some sort of legislative scrutiny or regulatory scrutiny that keeps the State ahead of the curve of where movements and trends are in regard to the gambling industry.  There are big challenges ahead for the legislation in that regard, although there is a clear political willingness to seek to address that.  If there is proper and robust engagement with the stakeholders, I believe it can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I have had some meetings with the Gaming and Leisure Association of Ireland - I think we have all been approached by it to some extent - and it tell us it welcomes the legislation.  It states that in creating a regulated industry and requiring all operators to be licensed, the Government could establish control over who is operating gambling in Ireland.  It also states that, pivotally, such a process would ensure that only those who have been deemed personally fit to operate and proven tax compliant would be permitted to engage in the provision of gambling services, driving criminality and the black market economy out of the industry.  That is a wonderful aspiration and we would all agree with it, but there is a massive challenge to that.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned I had meetings with the Gaming and Leisure Association of Ireland if only to articulate the fact the gaming and leisure sector would seek to be regulated.  If I was a cynic, I might say the reality is that members' clubs are in fact proprietary clubs run by owners as profitable commercial operations.  We know that concerns were expressed ten years ago in a report to Government on casinos that the provision of casino-style games in these clubs should be a matter of concern, given the provision of such games was entirely contrary to the intentions of the 1956 Act and that there was no regulation of their activities.  That was ten years ago and we might argue that there is such a proliferation of them now that there is a broad acceptance of them and it is a case of just saying, \"Ah well, let us do our best to regulate them\".<\/p>  <p>  If the sector is calling for regulation, we accept its bona fides in that regard.  The question is how the legislation will deal with the advances in technology and whether it can provide support for the people who have spoken so passionately about this, like Davy Glennon, who describes a win as \"only a loan to give back to the bookies\".  There are people standing up in society who are very brave and to whom we have a duty of care.  The challenge is whether we can legislate in a way that ensures we support people like Davy Glennon.  I do not want to patronise Mr. Glennon as I do not know the man from Adam but, given his courage in coming forward, we need to meet what he is saying with clear and robust legislation.<\/p>  <p>  While we have a long way to go, at least this is a starting point.  I congratulate Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing this forward and congratulate the Government for accepting the bona fides of the Bill.  I believe we will have much discourse throughout the various stages of this Bill to try to get it right, so we can speak for the type of people who Davy Glennon has spoken for, and for Davy Glennon himself, as one example, and that we endeavour to do our best on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900041#OO00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1525892100,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I am delighted to contribute on the Gambling Control Bill 2018.  This comprehensive Bill, brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il, is mainly based on the general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill 2013.  At the beginning of this year, the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, got Cabinet approval to draft an updated general scheme.  Although he may have answered this already, why is the Government drafting another general scheme when it did nothing with the 2013 Bill?  Is it not just time to accept this Private Members&rsquo; Bill and allow it to be amended on Committee Stage to make it the kind of legislation we need?<\/p>  <p>  A key difference seems to be whether the badly-needed regulator would be fully independent or established under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Bill before us has the regulator within the Department and provides for the regulation of gambling in Ireland.  It is long overdue, given that our current gambling legislation dates back to the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.<\/p>  <p>  Under Part 1, section 2, of the Bill before us, &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; is defined as gaming, betting or participating in a lottery or bingo and amusements.  However, I note the activities of horse racing, greyhound racing, the national lottery and financial spread betting will not be governed by this legislation, and daily fantasy sports have also been omitted, as they were omitted from the 2013 Bill.  Gambling through &ldquo;remote communications&rdquo; is also provided for in the Bill and means that the Internet, phone, television, radio and &ldquo;any other kind of electronic or other technology for facilitating communication&rdquo; is open to regulation.  This is a very important aspect of the Bill because access to gambling has largely moved online.<\/p>  <p>  Part 2 of the Bill sets out the functions of the Minister and the provisions for the establishment of the new office for gambling control Ireland, and outlines the characteristics of this office of State, including the functions of the chief executive and staff, codes of practice and so on.  The Bill provides for international co-operation under section 14 while, importantly, section 16 provides for the chief officer of the office of gambling control Ireland to attend Oireachtas committees, if so requested.  This is very important, given gambling on sports such as football and horse racing effectively operate as a single market in the UK and Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Section 78 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee on responsible gambling and that such a committee shall include a representative from the community or voluntary sector.  I believe this should be amended on Committee Stage either to reduce the number of licence holder representatives down to one or increase the number of community and voluntary representatives to two or three.  Part 7, section 79, provides for the establishment of a social fund within one year of the enactment of the Bill.  Section 80 sets out the purposes of the fund, which will be to &ldquo;promote socially responsible gambling&rdquo;.  I believe many people would question that phrase very strongly.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that most people like an occasional flutter on the national lottery or EuroMillions, or on the Grand National, the Derby or the Gold Cup.  This is a long-standing tradition for many Irish people, including in the area I originally come from, where Punchestown was a very important festival for local people, in particular farmers.<\/p><p>Many people wonder if there is or can be such a thing as &quot;socially responsible gambling&quot; given the devastation that all kinds of gambling has wrought on so many Irish citizens and families.  This has been greatly exacerbated by the explosion of online gambling in the past two decades.  The public knows that the massive profits of companies such as Paddy Power Betfair and Ladbrokes are based not on occasional flutters but on hardcore gambling addiction which profoundly impacts many people.<br\/><br\/>The human cost of gambling addiction is real and particularly acute in Ireland.  Recent statistics from the Rutland Centre have shown that there was a threefold increase in presentations with gambling addictions, up to 9% compared to 3% three years ago.  Other reports have shown that one in ten people in Ireland have a serious gambling problem and <i>The Economist<\/i>named Ireland as having the third highest rate of gambling losses <i>per capita<\/i>in the world in 2017, at almost $500 per adult.  We were listed as among the highest spenders on online gambling.<br\/><br\/>This is an important Bill and I commend Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing it forward.  There were references in some of the literature and responses to the Bill to the nanny-state but that argument does not really wash when one listens to the devastating real-life testimonies from people such as Galway hurler Davy Glennon, who has publicly spoken about his struggles with gambling addiction, which began when he was 16 years of age.  We have also heard recently the tragic story of Tony O'Reilly of An Post and the devastating impact of his addiction on himself and his family.  I admire the incisive and witty writing of Declan Lynch of the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>who has written very powerfully on the appalling impact of gambling addiction on families and individuals in our country.  When we hear these stories we have to take a very clear and strong view of gambling.  That is why we should have dealt with this legislation even ten or 15 years before the Gambling Control Bill 2013.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the social fund, Paddy Power's submission urged the Government to explore the UK model of operators voluntarily contributing to the Responsible Gambling Trust, RGT, instead of basing the contribution on turnover.  According to <i>problemgambling.ie<\/i>, however, just 63% of licence holders contributed during 2014-15.  In 2013, &pound;6.5 million was paid into the RGT while profits of &pound;1.42 billion were posted for the industry.  Last week, Paddy Power Betfair's first quarter profit announcement showed that its earnings dropped 6% since the famous merger but it is still expecting a full year result of between &pound;470 million and &pound;495 million.  Paddy Power Betfair reported an 18% increase over expectations during 2017 and this year is increasing its marketing spend by &pound;20 million.  Apart from the monetary and addiction problems, this website also claims US statistics show that one in five problem gamblers attempt suicide.<br\/><br\/>In the UK the Gambling Commission comes under the remit of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Gambling Act 2005 updated its laws and it is examining updating them further because it allowed casino type development and the proliferation of online gambling without taking urgent action.  The UK Government is also considering lowering the maximum stake that can be paid into fixed odds betting terminals, FOBTs, or slot machine-type betting.  It is good that type of gambling has been outlawed here.  At the same time, all eyes are on the potential US market because it looks as if it will repeal its very strong gambling laws.<br\/><br\/>It is estimated that approximately 6.8 million people across the European Union are gambling online and the 2015 revenue for that sector of gambling was expected to be around &euro;13 billion.  The total gambling market in the EU is worth approximately &euro;85 million.  I welcome the Bill and section 28(3)(b) which provides for the licensed premises to provide proof of adequate insurance cover and health and safety certification and so on before being licensed.  Chapter 5 and section 52(4) are also very important if we are to have a credible system of regulation.  Part 4 provides for monitoring and compliance.  Part 6 provides for safeguards and section 70 is very welcome where it states that credit facilities shall not be permitted.  Section 72 bans the employment of young people in delivering a licensed gambling service.  There are many very welcome provisions and I hope this legislation will speedily move to Committee Stage.  Gambling deserves intense and ongoing scrutiny.  Its negative impacts and the testimonies we have heard of people with addiction must be closely listened to.  We need a strong system of regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900041#OO00300","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525892700,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I compliment and thank Deputies Jack Chambers and O'Callaghan and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for bringing a very sensible and well-thought out Bill before this House.  We are seeing a great change in the way gambling is carried out in our culture and society.  Many years ago when we were discussing gambling I mentioned the structure of gambling, professional bookies and a very close friend of mine, Timmy O'Leary, who has since retired from owning a bookie's shop.  He was steeped in the tradition of being a good bookie, a person who took money from people when he knew they had it and did not allow people to give away or gamble money they did not have.<\/p>  <p>  With the advent of the smartphone people sitting in their houses late at night might be watching two horses with only six legs between them in some part of Texas at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. on Sky or another channel might decide it is a good idea to bet money they do not have on this device.  That is crazy beyond belief.  The way people gambled before now was a fine respectable thing, going into an individual bookie, or even to a bigger bookie when the large conglomerates came along, because at least it was regulated.  The person behind the till could see the person and was dealing with a customer.  It has gone crazy now.  There has to be more regulation and protection of families.  It is bad enough to do something that is not good for oneself but a family person hurts their family as well and takes money that is needed to run the house and keep the family going.

When I was a student I worked at the dogs in Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park and learnt a very valuable lesson.  I calculated the payout on the tote.

I support the call for an independent office to regulate the gambling industry.  This means that the gambling regulator must operate outside the Department of Justice and Equality with powers to impose significant fines on gambling firms which do not comply with the new laws.  Gambling addiction is a scourge in Ireland.  Up to 40,000 people have gambling problems.  These figures are from 2015 and I imagine the problem is much greater than that.  Ireland has the third highest gambling losses in the world and the health and social costs of problem gambling are very destructive to our society.

It has also been found that Ireland has the third highest <i>per capita<\/i>rating in the world for losses in gambling.  That is another staggering figure.  Last year, Ireland's losses from gambling totalled an enormous &euro;2.1 billion.  Online gambling is the most popular method, with almost half of the gambling losses coming from that sector.  The second most popular method of gambling is traditional betting.

Unfortunately, during that time the sophistication of the gambling companies has increased dramatically.  The introduction of online gambling means that people can gamble in private.

As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, pointed out earlier, the Government is not opposing the Private Members' Bill sponsored by Deputies Jim O'Callaghan, Jack Chambers and Ann Rabbitte.  The proposed Bill is a replication of the general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill 2013.  That scheme was an ambitious effort to introduce comprehensive reform of our antiquated gambling legislation.  It was intended to replace all current gaming and betting legislation and to bring licensing and regulatory functions together in one place.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who has special responsibility in the area of gambling policy and regulation, set out in some detail the work under way in the Department of justice to review and enhance the original Government proposals in the general scheme of the 2013 Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I admit that progress has been somewhat slower than any of us would wish in advancing the Government's legislative proposals.  Now, due to the passage of time and the rapid evolution of the gambling sector, there is a consequent need to ensure that proposed measures to ensure effective regulation and protection of the consumer and vulnerable persons are fit for purpose now and into the future.  It is in this context that the Government, on 10 January, agreed to review the general scheme of the 2013 Bill and to make significant changes.  By contrast, the Bill proposed this evening is simply a replication of the Government's earlier proposals, with no new elements or recognition of how fast the gambling industry has evolved over that period of time.  However, I accept it as being an important contribution to the debate, and I thank Deputy Rabbitte and others for this positive and constructive contribution.  <\/p>  <p>  The critical element of the Government decision of 10 January is for the establishment of a gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality.  This approach is somewhat different to the original proposal to establish an office for gambling control, which would have featured more direct involvement from the Minister.  Independent regulation is the normal situation in most EU member states.  An independent regulator would offer assurance that decision making would be free from any potential undue influence.  It would also provide greater assurance for both consumers and potential investors in gaming related activities that could bring employment and revenue benefits.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has agreed that there is a need for the development of an appropriate licensing, monitoring, inspection, supervision and enforcement regime for land-based gaming machines, either in casinos or located elsewhere, that may be played for monetary reward.  The general scheme of the 2013 Bill requires further development with regard to issues such as numbers, locations for machines and stake or prize amounts.  The new regulatory authority would have the responsibility to develop the necessary terms and conditions.  These conditions must be clear, fair, legitimate and transparent to all.  There is evidence that the gambling industry is moving away from land-based gaming machines in favour of online versions.  Any discriminatory licensing approaches to gaming machines might attract legal challenge by operators.  <\/p>  <p>  Another area that will require our further attention is the conditions that will attach to the licensing of casinos.  We must introduce formal legislation to regulate casinos.  In that context, there are almost 40 private members' clubs providing gaming facilities and services of the type that would be available in licensed casinos as proposed under the 2013 scheme.  The current regulatory requirement on these clubs is that they register with my Department under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 and to pay appropriate taxes to the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard contributions from Deputies this evening which highlighted the issue of problem gambling and of gambling addiction.  The media sometimes features the sad and unfortunate experiences of a number of persons whose addiction has lead them into dark places, with risks to their liberty, health and survival and which causes ongoing suffering for themselves and their families.<\/p><p>As public representatives, we have all heard very sad and disturbing stories.  The Minister of State outlined earlier the efforts by various arms of Government to obtain reliable information and statistics in this regard.<\/p> <p> What should be our response as legislators?  The 2013 scheme contained a number of proposed responses.  It enhanced consumer protection for participants in gambling activities.  We will insist on fair play from the gambling companies in the shape of clear and reasonable terms and conditions and no hidden conditions regarding payouts and acceptance of bets from successful participants.  I am very much of the view that our normal consumer protections must apply in this area.  The very ancient prohibition on enforcement of gambling debts will be removed in respect of licensed activities.<\/p> <p> Enhanced consumer protection can contribute to our attempts to better protect vulnerable persons who may be prone to problem gambling, but we will do more.  The Minister of State and I will insist on a workable self-exclusion process with gambling operators.  While I am conscious of possible data protection issues, we must ensure this protective measure as far as we can.  I appreciate that it will be easier to apply to online accounts, but we will study what can be done in our traditional bookies' shops and other gambling establishments. <\/p> <p> The final element has to be the development of a social fund.  In this context, a new independent regulatory authority will be the critical factor in the operation of such a fund.  I would envisage that this fund would operate with the support of those professional and expert organisations involved in the treatment of addicts.  Levies on gambling operators will provide the appropriate resources for this fund.  To progress the review and updating of the 2013 general scheme, the Government agreed that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, should chair a working group comprising all stakeholder Departments, appropriate officers and the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p> The group has considered new developments, not only in Ireland but also in other states in its work.  In addition to our focus on developing the 2013 general scheme, my Department has been working to bring forward early proposals to update the antiquated Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 in a number of areas.  These proposals were agreed by the Government on 11 July last year for inclusion in the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  They will now be contained in a separate Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill.  This is currently under preparation by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I am expecting publication of the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill during the autumns session of the D&aacute;il.  It will include setting the minimum age limit for participating in such activities at 18 years; procedures for the better promotion of minor local lotteries; streamlining the application process for permits and licences for the promotion of minor gaming and lotteries; and raising the current, unrealistic monetary limits on stakes and prizes for gaming machines licensed in relevant local authority areas.  These amounts are set at currently 3 cent and 50 cent.  It is proposed to raise the stake amount to &euro;10 and the prize amounts to &euro;750.  There is a need for immediate reform in this area.  <\/p> <p> I need not remind members of this House how important locally run lotteries are to the financial well-being of many sports clubs and community groups throughout the country.  Deputies will thus appreciate how important it is to update the law regarding the promotion of fundraising lottery activities at local level for charitable and philanthropic purposes, and to streamline the application process for permits and for licences.<\/p> <p> The guiding principle of the 2013 scheme was that only gambling activities which were licensed and regulated would be lawful.  Only the regulatory body might issue licences for such activities.  The licensing principles would apply equally to both land-based and online services.  I can assure the Deputies that this principle remains.  New, modern gambling legislation, in conjunction with independent regulation, offers the best route to enhanced consumer protection, increased Exchequer revenue from the industry and development of a full range of treatments and mediation methods to address the problems of gambling, assisted by agencies competent in this field.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said earlier that he would be happy to receive realistic proposals from Deputies that can contribute to updating the 2013 general scheme.  I very much support that position.  It would be very useful to receive wisdom from all sides so that we can progress the development of modern and effective legislation.  In this regard, I again acknowledge the contribution of Deputies Chambers and Rabbitte and others opposite.<\/p> <p> Finally, I want to acknowledge the Minister of State's work within Government, across Departments and within my own Department.  I acknowledge his commitment to introducing an ambitious package of legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, takes a very collegiate and open approach to policy development.  I would urge all Deputies to work with him to bring forward the best possible new laws as soon as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900044#RR00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525894500,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We need effective regulation for this industry to give those who work in the sector certainty through socially responsible gambling.  We are committed to working with the industry to build this new framework, but the time for action has long since passed.  Legislative action is now needed.<\/p>  <p>  More than anything else, an inability to control one's behaviour characterises an addiction problem.  In a very real sense, gambling becomes an obsession in a person's life, taking on greater and greater importance the longer the addiction persists.  More than 40,000 people in Ireland are known to have a gambling addiction, with single men under 35 most at risk according to a UCD study.  Problem gamblers spend more time gambling or thinking about gambling, and it can become extremely difficult to maintain a normal family life.  This creates stress and has a negative impact on relationships and family life.  Families usually have more arguments over money, and they can be hounded by debt collectors.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of online gambling now makes gambling available to all, at any time, day or night, anywhere a person can go online.  It also means that in a lot of cases gambling can be secret, and huge debts can be incurred very quickly.  The growing size and intensity of the gambling sector makes this Bill a priority.  Protecting vulnerable gamblers and individuals is a key component of this legislation, and I would also like to commend my colleagues, the three Deputies who brought the Bill forward.

Similar to so many other areas of policy, it is disappointing that once again it is the Opposition that has to do the Government's work for it.<\/p>  <p>  People take up gambling for diverse reasons.  Some are amused by it while others enjoy the feeling of excitement or sense of power that risk-taking gives them.  For others it is a social outlet, a way to avoid isolation.  For some, especially those in difficult financial circumstances, it gives them a false sense of hope that they can win.<\/p>  <p>  However, we know that gambling causes great harm.  Addictive gambling is linked to numerous social problems that devastate the gambler's life, such as effects on their physical and mental health, criminal acts such as theft, bankruptcy and separation.  Gambling addiction has been associated with serious mental health conditions.  Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, social phobias and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, often co-occur.<\/p><p>This complex situation can mean that another mental health illness may make a person more vulnerable to developing an addiction.  In other words, the addiction may be symptomatic of the illness or cause another illness.  In such cases, the other disorders must also be treated in order to treat the addiction itself.  There is hope for those with co-occurring mental health illness and gambling addiction, but all of a person's co-occurring disorders must be identified.  How each condition affects the others must be understood and they must be treated together.  Gambling addiction is an insidious one because there are often no outward signs that something is wrong until it is too late and they face financial ruin.  With over 40,000 people in Ireland known to have a gambling addiction, with that number increasing and with the known effects being so devastating, the time for delay is long over.  The time for action is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900045#SS00900","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525895100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues, Deputies Jack Chambers and Jim O'Callaghan, for bringing forward the Bill.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, for accepting it and assisting its progress on Committee Stage.  That is very welcome.  I started on this as a particular crusade because of the social need within society.  Every Member, including the Minister and Minister of State, acknowledges that there is an appetite for change and a view that the archaic regulation which is currently in place is not fit for purpose any longer.  While I acknowledge that the Minister and Minister of State are also working on their own amendments, the appetite is to have this Bill progress on Committee Stage.  If we can have a race to the top to see which Bill comes out most quickly, it would be best for everyone.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State did not provide a timeframe in his statement.  I would like to think that we have the will to let this Bill come before the justice committee.  I want to get it in there.  I am not saying people cannot table amendments.  I want amendments and for everyone to come forward with their proposals.  Deputies Harty and &Oacute; Laoghaire put forward very valid objections this evening and proposals as to how best to enhance the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is about a few key drivers which would make a difference, in particular through a gambling regulator, on which we all agree.  Another driver is a social fund to support the likes of Cuan Mhuire, the Rutland Centre and various other facilities which provide great support to individuals and their families.  Another is advertising, which everyone has discussed this evening.  As spokesperson for children and youth affairs, I note that any child who sits down to watch a Premiership game is targeted inadvertently and shown that gambling is where it is at.  There is no shut off from it.  I understand that we cannot control everything, but we can put procedures in place to legislate.  They are doing it in the UK.  They are doing it in Canada and they are doing it in Australia.  We could do it here also.  I cannot see why not.<\/p>  <p>  There are vulnerable people and young people.  There are people in our society who need protection.  Industry is not against any of this.  Not one person in industry has told me he or she does not support the Gambling Control Bill 2018.  They have all said they would openly welcome a regulator and they acknowledge the idea of social exclusion.  The reason we are having so open a conversation is that certain people have stood up.  We have to talk about my own constituent, Davy Glennon, who is now an ambassador for the GAA.  He stepped forward and told his story.  Tony O'Brien stepped forward and told his story.  Behind all of these stories are affected families and lives which have been destroyed.  Davy and Tony are fortunate because they were able to get support and to engage with people who could help them through.  Regrettably, there are many who do not get that support.  How difficult that is.  That is where the social fund would be well spent.  We could put it back into communities to provide the support they need.<\/p>  <p>  Training and education are important and some of the social fund could be invested there.  The online world is in children's hands morning, noon and night in the apps they use.  I spoke at the AV presentation last week about the Conor McGregor fight.  I tried to stream it online that night but I could not watch it due to the proliferation of pop-up screens.  I could not get in to see the fight because too many people were offering me the chance to place a bet.  That is what young people were experiencing on the night too.  I did not have a bookie's account but I was being targeted.  If I had an account, it would have been difficult with the intensity of the marketing that was taking place.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the role the GAA has played in this context in the last number of months.  The GAA has stepped forward without any legislation and taken ownership of the issue.  It is going into every parish and community.  One thinks of the Oisin McConville story and how he has been an ambassador to various clubs.  The GAA has acknowledged that there is a huge issue in communities and it is trying to support its membership.  We have to acknowledge what it is doing.  It would be wonderful if we could allow the Bill to go to the justice committee.  While the Government is facilitating this, we all know how the system works.  I do not want it stalled and would like to see it emerge from the lottery along the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900046#TT00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1525895100,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Do not interfere with the lottery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900046#TT00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525895100,"counter":479,"content":"<p>One should not mention the lottery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900046#TT00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1525895100,"counter":480,"content":"<p>What I mean is that we do not want to wait another three, four or five years to bring forward this legislative change.

It is 68 years since plans for the European Coal and Steel Community were announced.  It was a bold plan in a post-war context which envisaged the close interlinking of European economies to ensure, as Robert Schumann himself claimed, that war between historic rivals would not only be \"merely unthinkable, but materially impossible\".  Since then, the European Union has developed into an area in which citizens enjoy the highest living standards, the highest levels of social protection, the highest level of labour rights and the highest protections for human rights in history.<\/p>  <p>  As we celebrate 45 years as a member state of the EU, it is timely to reflect on our relationship with the Union over the past number of decades.  Ireland has benefitted enormously from membership of the European Union.  With EU support, it has transformed into a modern, outward-looking country and an excellent place to do business where the standard of living matches that of the most prosperous of our European partners.  EU membership has helped to improve almost every aspect of life in Ireland from how we work, travel and shop to the quality of our environment, opportunities for learning and way in which our businesses buy and sell goods and services.<\/p><p>EU membership has enabled our transformation from a mainly rural economy to a modern economy driven by high technology industry and global exports, while membership of the eurozone has facilitated exports and international travel.  We have reduced our reliance on the United Kingdom in trade and there is now a much wider market for Irish goods and services across the Union.  Furthermore, the EU provided the context through which we succeeded in forging strong bonds of co-operation and solidarity not only across the EU but also across these islands and on our own island, after many years of conflict.  That has been highlighted even more by the challenges we are facing with Brexit.<\/p> <p> Successive Irish Governments have recognised over the past 45 years, and no less so today, that Ireland&rsquo;s place in the EU is in our best interests.  Irish people are consistently among the most supportive of engagement at EU level.  A Red C poll commissioned on behalf of European Movement Ireland and published this morning shows that 92% of Irish people support Ireland&rsquo;s continued membership of the EU.  More interestingly, 97% of 18 to 24 year olds showed support.  This is a level we have never seen previously.  More Irish students than ever are participating in the ERASMUS+ programme and are finding jobs and careers in other member states, while Irish business continues to grow and expand across the EU.  A priority of this Government is to maintain and increase the number of Irish people working in the EU institutions, and we have been very active in promoting these career options and offering support to those searching for an international career in the EU.  I have travelled to the various universities and engaged with the students to show them the opportunities that are available to them in Europe.<\/p> <p> This is not to say that from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective all is as it should be in the EU.  However, while reforms in some areas may be necessary, the fact that the vast majority of people believe that our membership of the Union is a positive factor for Ireland is a valuable starting point.  Most people understand that the EU is not perfect, and never will be.  However, it is the best mechanism to deal with the challenges we face each day.  Every year on 9 May we celebrate Schuman&rsquo;s vision for Europe in 1950.  This year is arguably even more significant as we face into an uncertain future as 27 members, following the decision of the UK to leave the Union.  Of course, conversations must be held about the future direction of the EU, what we want from it and how it can work for us.  This is all in the context of the difficult issues we have faced over the past number of years, such as the financial crisis, the migration crisis, the recent terror attacks on EU soil that have tested member states and the steady growth of Euroscepticism in some member states.  Furthermore, the aftermath of Brexit and the new upcoming budget cycle, as well as political developments in other parts of the EU, have underlined the need for these discussions to take place.<\/p> <p> Working closely with a range of EU partners has always been important for Ireland, but strengthening and diversifying these relationships have assumed renewed importance in light of Brexit.  I thank our partners across Europe for the unwavering solidarity they have shown to Ireland on issues relating to Brexit and also in setting out our negotiating objectives.  It is also essential for us to understand their perspective on other issues and to discuss our shared priorities for the future of Europe.  For example, in many key economic and institutional policy areas we share a common approach with the Nordic and Baltic member states and with the Netherlands.  Our engagement stretches across the Government, with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Finance engaging in meetings in advance of EU Council meetings with their counterparts.  I will participate in a similar meeting organised by Latvia to discuss the multiannual financial framework, MFF, later this week.  The Taoiseach and Ministers also engage in an intensive programme of bilateral exchanges with our partners, which allows us to seek common ground, agree key priorities or, at the very least, better inform each other of where we are coming from and of other issues where we might seem to diverge.  Understanding each other better goes to the heart of what the EU is about.<\/p> <p> We live in a changing world, with major shifts brought about by globalisation, migration, climate change and threats to our security as well as political challenges to the current international order.  We, the member states and citizens of the EU, must ask ourselves if the EU is fit for purpose to address the many challenges we will face in the coming years.  On 15 November last, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I launched a national citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe.  Over the past number of months we have been engaging with people of all ages and from all sectors to hear their views about the Union and its future direction.  We held regional events in Galway, Cork, Maynooth, Letterkenny, Navan and Dublin, to name a few, where we heard from citizens and from representatives of civic society, as well as community and voluntary organisations.  The events were structured around discussions on key thematic areas, which included security, social policy, education, equal opportunities, the environment, competitiveness and investment.  The key driver of these dialogues was the engagement and involvement of as many people as possible.  The slogan we chose for this campaign is straightforward and simple: \"It's your future; your Europe; get involved\".  I am pleased that many people did get involved.<\/p> <p> These events culminated earlier today at our Europe Day event in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, where our discussions brought these key themes together.  I am grateful to all of the people, including Members of this House and of the Seanad, who attended and contributed so much to this process over the past six months.  Irish people have a deep and informed interest in Europe.  We heard a wide range of views in what has been an open, inclusive and participative process.  People have embraced it and got involved.  I believe we have a real sense of how Irish people are engaging about Europe and the issues of interest to them.  Broadly, the overwhelming majority of Irish citizens who participated in these events see opportunity in the EU and value Ireland&rsquo;s continued role in it.  Ireland&rsquo;s future in Europe goes way beyond the Brexit issue, and we can look towards a shared future with our EU partners with real optimism.<\/p> <p> Areas such as education and training, research and innovation, environmental protection, rural development and competitiveness were among the stand-out issues where participants in our consultations felt more EU action is required.  Specifically, the areas of education and training came up continuously at each event and were in each question that was asked.  We have to take all this information and bring everything we have learned through this process together.  We have to make sure it informs the Government&rsquo;s analysis and our contribution to the Europe-wide debate that is taking place.<\/p> <p> A clear difference between today and when we joined what was then the EEC in 1973 is that we now live in a much more interconnected and globalised world.  We face growing competition from emerging economies such as China, India, Asia and Africa, and are challenged by a range of new issues, such as mass migration, climate change, cyber threats and international terrorism.  Most Irish people agree that these issues are too big to be dealt with by one member state alone and value the co-operation and solidarity achieved through the EU to deal with them.<\/p> <p> The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has increased funding to a number of organisations that are involved in communicating European issues to the public.  They include European Movement Ireland and the Institute for International and European Affairs, IIEA, both of which have been active and involved in the future of Europe discussion.  I also recently announced a fund of &euro;100,000 for 15 civil society bodies, NGOs and organisations through the Communicating Europe initiative.  I can give a flavour of some, which are quite wide and varied.  There will be a special Blindboy Podcast on Europe live at the MindField arena at the Electric Picnic festival in September.  The young innovators for Europe project will be undertaken by the Young Social Innovators and a Big Friendly Guide to the European Union will be launched for primary schools, to complement the Blue Star EU education programme.  I expect that these projects will further encourage people to engage, participate and communicate with the various different bodies and outreach assistance that is available to them.<\/p> <p> Turning to the MFF, the European Commission just last week published its proposals in advance of negotiations for the next MFF from 2021-27.  This will be our first budget cycle without the contribution of the United Kingdom and debates have been ongoing around the approach we should take to the next budget, whether increased contributions from member states is the best way forward, whether a smaller Union necessarily means a smaller EU budget or whether a combination of approaches is the best way forward.  We have always said we would be willing to contribute more but we would need to see that there is European added value where that money is contributed.  Ireland has traditionally been a significant net beneficiary of the EU budget since accession in 1973.  This is first time we will enter the negotiations where that will change.  We must continue to adapt to the EU&rsquo;s evolving priorities, particularly where we can see evidence of European added value.  Ireland stands ready to engage positively on these.<\/p> <p> However, we cannot lose sight of the value and contribution of traditional policies, including those on agriculture and cohesion.  Indeed, the Common Agricultural Policy has been central to maintaining and supporting Irish farmers, who were the backbone of our economy for many years and still represent a hugely important economic sector for us.  It is also vital that there be a continuation of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes post Brexit, as foreseen in the Commission's progress report from last December.  Last week at our Brexit stakeholder forum I saw how important these are.  We will consider the Commission's proposals in full and we look forward to engaging with them.<\/p> <p> To conclude, it is evident that despite the many challenges we face in the coming months and years Ireland's outlook on the future of the European Union is positive.  Irish people recognise the importance of EU membership.  The ties we have developed and the relationships we have built will continue post Brexit.  I believe it is fitting to celebrate Europe Day each year, as we look forward to a stronger and better Union into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900046#TT01500","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525896300,"counter":492,"content":"<p>The next slot is Fianna F&aacute;il's.

It is appropriate that we are having a debate on the future of Europe this evening.  This morning we had the final public session of the national citizens' dialogue in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, and it was encouraging to see the active participation of so many citizens in this public consultation process.  In addition, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the European Union Affairs has given serious consideration to this matter in recent months.  Fianna F&aacute;il has made a formal submission to the future of Europe consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  A RED C poll just published found that 92% of the Irish population now agrees that Ireland should remain part of the EU.  This finding is welcome but this public support should not be taken for granted.  The EU is in need of reform, and engagement and communication with the citizens need to be constantly improved.  Brexit was a wake-up call for all of us, so this evening's debate is timely and necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on the Future of Europe was published by the European Commission in March 2017.  It outlined the five scenarios.  In addition, there have since been significant inputs to the debate from the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the French Republic, Emmanuel Macron.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has always been a strong advocate of the EU.  Se&aacute;n Lemass began the application process and we joined the EEC in 1973, 45 years ago, under the leadership of Jack Lynch and Paddy Hillery.  There is no doubt but that Ireland has greatly benefitted from EU membership.  EU Structural Funds have vastly improved our infrastructure, and access to the European Single Market has transformed how we trade, study, travel and work.  Sustained investment in groundbreaking research projects, clean beaches, safer roads initiatives, cheaper air travel, more stringent regulation of banks, broader tourism links and stronger employment and consumer rights offer just a glimpse of the variety of benefits Ireland has gained.  Ireland should remain at the heart of Europe and we must play a central role in the constructive debate now under way concerning reform of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The EU certainly faces many challenges, including Brexit, international terrorism, the recent economic crisis, immigration, youth unemployment and the rise of far-right, illiberal tendencies and populism generally.  Ireland can and will play its part in resolving these ongoing challenges.  With the UK leaving the EU, there will be a shift in the balance of power in the European Union.  The Franco-German alliance is now reasserting itself.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the EU must be a Union of equals in which smaller member states willing to play their part are fully included and respected.  The EU must not be allowed to become a Europe that is dominated by larger countries which only serve the interests of a few, to the detriment of all others.<\/p>  <p>  All of us who believe in the EU subscribe to European values and ideals, but these values and ideals are under threat in some countries, Hungary and Poland in particular, and it is very important we deal with these threats.  Independent state institutions in Hungary and Poland are being curtailed.  This threat to the rule of law undermines democracy and freedom, which are core EU values.  The EU must take a strong and united stand and take appropriate measures against member states that undermine EU law.  We are willing to play a full and active role in this debate, and I look forward to hearing the remaining contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900048#VV00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896300,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il has always been a strong advocate of the European Union and we remain so.  As my colleague has said, we joined the European Union under the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il in 1973.  Since then, we have seen many positive impacts on and changes to our country as a result of our membership of the European Union.  The ability to trade, study, travel and work in other member states is something we as EU citizens value very much, and the improvements in our infrastructure, waterways and environment are evident in every party of our country as a result of EU Structural Funds, policies and laws.  Ireland is a proud and active member of the European Union and has been transformed in many ways with the help of progressive social policies from the European Union.  We have seen a long period of peace and stability across the EU, and this is down to us working as a Union for the betterment of all citizens, something we should never take for granted.<\/p>  <p>  As a party, we remain committed to the European Union.  However, we need to see reform, and I believe citizens are demanding that reform.  One need only consider Brexit to see there is a lot of unrest and disquiet among citizens across the European Union with the direction in which the Union is going.  When one sees the advance of the far right and parties across different countries advocating an anti-European stance, that is quite worrying and something that we should not ignore but tackle head on.  This is why I am glad to have an opportunity to participate in this debate on the future of Europe.  Europe has faced many challenges, the most notable now being the one we are dealing with at present, namely, Brexit, which will test the Union and every member state, not just Ireland.  However, I believe this is an opportune time for the European Union institutions and all member states to reflect on the EU project as a whole: what it is, what our shared objectives are and the direction in which we wish to move.  Brexit presents us with a unique opportunity to have this debate both nationally and across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is undoubtedly the most significant event in the history of the European project and is a setback for the entire EU.  We have concerns about the fact that the UK has stated it is leaving the customs union and the Single Market and concerns about the challenges this poses for us on the island of Ireland in respect of our Border with Northern Ireland and the communities North and South, but also for our business communities, which do a lot of trade with the UK.  We know the European Union will be down approximately 12% of its budget with the UK leaving and we are also losing an ally in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Minister of State mentioned the MFF and the next budget for the European Union.  We are concerned that we will see a significant reduction in the CAP for our country and this will mean that hard-hit families across the farming sector will see a reduction in their incomes.<\/p>  <p>  While there are many challenges, we need to see a Union that is strong and effective, a Union characterised by strong and stable democracies, balanced economic growth, sustainable employment, fair wages and a welfare system that protects against poverty and provides a floor below which no one should be expected to live.  These are challenges that we must face head on as a State, as a Parliament and as citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900048#VV00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896300,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue in the little time I have.  The European Union, the project itself, has been exceptionally positive in the impact it has had both in Ireland and across the broader European continent.  This is clearly evident in increased living standards across all European countries in recent years.  Considering the impact the European Union has had on employment law, equality legislation, social policy and the development of infrastructure across the European Union, it has all been positive.<\/p>  <p>  National governments and political parties across Europe use the European Union as a battering ram from time to time.  They blame the European Union for some of the policies that may be unpopular in the short term but probably positive in the longer term.  At times, national governments fray away at the confidence of the European project for their own domestic purposes, and this issue must be addressed.  The core message, however, is that Ireland has played a very active role in the European Union over many years.  The European Union should remain a community of nations rather than moving towards a federal Europe, whereby it becomes a nation of communities.  This an issue we must look at long and hard.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit, in the context of the economic impact it will have on Ireland and the broader European Union, is of huge significance.  However, the question that must be asked is why did this happen in the first place?  We see anti-European sentiment and agitation from extremes on the left and the right across Europe fraying away at this concept, so it is important to ensure that the political centre advocates all that is positive about the European Union.  We see parties trying to undermine this, particularly on the left and the extreme right.  Even some of the left, however, are now becoming pro-European, so we welcome Deputy Cullinane's party to the family of European parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900048#VV00400","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896300,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Thank you, Billy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900048#VV00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896300,"counter":497,"content":"<p>The European project is not something we should just mention once a year, on Europe Day, and move on.

My party believes the entire island of Ireland should stay in the European Union, that the European Union has been good for Ireland and that there is much we can celebrate in being a member of it.  Equally, my party has a critical engagement with the European Union, rightly so when one considers that many citizens across the Union are becoming more concerned about the centralisation of power and, as Deputy Billy Kelleher said, a drift towards a more federal Europe and the building, not of a social Europe but a more undemocratic Europe where the big institutions have far too much power and people who are not elected to positions are making decisions that effect the lives of others and cannot be held to account.  We all know what happens when that happens.  In this state we can point to many examples and the most recent scandals to see that it does not work.  However, the thing Deputy Billy Kelleher left out in his contribution is that the creeping federalisation of Europe did not happen by chance.  It did not happen overnight, it happened with the passing of every single treaty that his party supported and championed.  All of the treaties that gave the big institutions the powers they have, that created the undemocratic Europe we have and the federal Europe the Deputy now decries are treaties his party went out and sold with gusto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":500,"content":"<p>The Deputy's party would just vote &quot;No&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":501,"content":"<p>At least my party and others had the courage to have a critical engagement and state that while, yes, we wanted to be part of the European Union, we want a European Union that was democratic, one in which smaller states did have powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":502,"content":"<p>We all do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I noticed that when other Deputies made their contributions, there were no interruptions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Deputy David Cullinane to speak, without interruption, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00700","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I assume I will be given the same opportunity-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Yes, the Deputy should try to address the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW00900","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":507,"content":"<p>-----as difficult as it might be for some of the representatives of those parties that were part of the problem that led to the creation of what is becoming a federal Europe.  They do not like to hear the truth.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that almost every party is becoming more critical of the European Union.  For example, the Government is robustly challenging the Apple judgment of the European Commission.  Both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are, rightly, exercised by a consolidated tax coming from the European Union.  Everybody has a right to be critical and should be critical of measures that emerge from the European Union, but that does not make us anti-European, it makes us alert to others having agendas, including other bigger member states, and the fact that we must look out for our interests.  We must be confident and able to assert our own identity and vision for the type of European Union we want to build.  I want to see a European Union that is about workers' rights, social solidarity and investing in public services and which is not about stripping countries of social services and the neo-liberalism that has seen more privatisation and outsourcing to the private sector of what the public sector did in the past.  Much of this has been driven by European directives and the European Union.  There are some areas where the European Union has been good and others where it has not.  It is important that we have an honest engagement and discussion about what the European Union is and what it has done for Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The biggest challenge facing the European Union is Brexit.  That should not define the European Union, but it is obviously huge in the impact it will have on citizens in Europe and this state, in particular.  There was a political agreement in December.  The Government came back and hailed it as a breakthrough, that we had a cast iron guarantee that the Irish issues were protected, that we had a backstop arrangement that was bulletproof, as the Taoiseach put it, that the Border issue was safe, that there would be no hardening of the Border and that the Good Friday Agreement would be protected in all of its parts and that the rights of EU citizens living in the North who were Irish citizens would be fully protected.  It has all begun to unravel since.  It began to unravel because it was only a political agreement.  The key words in it, that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed, were exactly that.  We now see a civil war in the Tory Party playing out before us, with multiple wings, and nobody knows who is in charge, or from day to day what is the British Government's position, yet we are at a defining moment in the talks between the European Union and the British Government on trade and we are nowhere near knowing what it will all mean for Ireland.  The European Commission tried to translate the political text into a legal format which was rejected out of hand by Mrs. Theresa May who said no British Prime Minister could countenance a border in the Irish Sea, which is precisely what she did when she signed up to the backstop arrangement.  At this point, people living on either side of the Border have no idea about what will be put in place.  The British Government has resiled from the political agreement made in December, which is unacceptable.  <\/p>  <p>  We have to hope the European Union can reach an agreement with Britain on some customs partnership or free trade agreement.  That is where we are.  It is a long way from bulletproof, being cast iron, and all of the certainties that we were guaranteed.  We face an uncertain period.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are saying the right things and presenting an image of wearing the green jersey, that they were out representing Ireland's interests.  We said we would support the Government in achieving the best outcome for the State, but both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste said we needed an agreement with the British Government by June.  We accepted this.  We need to see the colour of Mrs. Theresa May's money and the British Government's proposals in June.  Now we hear from the T&aacute;naiste that what he actually meant was if there was sufficient progress.  What does \"sufficient progress\" mean?  There is no benchmark that sets out what it is.  I can imagine that when we arrive in June, the can will be kicked down the road, that there will be further uncertainty and that we will still not know what has been agreed to.  There is a fear that if the British Government puts its proposals on the North of Ireland on the table they will also be the proposals that they want for the rest of Britain.  That will end their hand in the ongoing negotiations.  All of us in this House were deeply conscious of the potential for the Irish issues to be used as a pawn in the negotiation between the European Union and Britain and that is how it has worked out.  We all agreed that we would move from phase 1 to phase 2 if we there was real progress on the Irish issues.  We moved to phase 2, but we do not have real progress.  The Government has a big job of work to do and I wish it well because we want the best deal.  The problem is that there is so much uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the potential for a European army.  Last December the D&aacute;il voted by 75 to 42 in favour of Ireland joining the PESCO agreement on greater European co-operation on military missions.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael coalesced on the issue.  As they are in government together, it is no surprise that they did so, but we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, opposed it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW01000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in was aligned with ETA for years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900049#WW01100","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1525896900,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Other parties which are fearful of an emerging European superstate were also against it.

Since Ireland joined what was then the European Economic Community on 1 January 1973 our country has literally been transformed.  The events of the last decade, however, have challenged the institutions which decades of work have assembled and have led to fresh questions about the future of our Union and about where we are going.  The wrenching economic crisis sparked an existential crisis, the consequences of which are still playing out.  New institutions and mechanisms were established and fiscal and economic powers concentrated in the Commission and in the ECB.  Ireland has recovered economically but socially the scars remain.  Political instability in Italy and Spain continues and Greece still struggles to recover from its economic woes.  The rise of right-wing populism in France and Germany shows that even the heartlands of the Union are in difficulty, while in the east the undermining of democratic institutions in Poland and Hungary poses a threat that we simply cannot ignore.<\/p>  <p>  However, the greatest test for us is Brexit.  The exit of a member state was contemplated in the Lisbon treaty but few of the crafters of that treaty believed it would ever be tested.  The vote of the UK to leave the Union nearly two years ago continues to reverberate and the unthinkable will become reality next March when the UK actually leaves.  The challenges I have highlighted are all of deep concern, but it only shows how far we have come that 28, soon to be 27, individual countries on this continent continue to participate in the greatest concentration of sovereignty in European history.  The clear message is that together we are stronger and together we can solve problems that have beset this continent for centuries.  Together Europe is able to find solutions to the difficulties we currently face.<\/p>  <p>  Encouragingly, as others have pointed out, the results of the most recent European Movement poll show that 92% of Irish people want to stay part of the European Union.  It also found that despite the lack of real public debate about the decision of Ireland to join PESCO, which was referenced by the previous speaker, 59% of people supported Irish engagement in military and defence structures.  To my mind that is a surprising figure.  I regret the rushed decision of the Government last year to sign up to PESCO without proper debate here.  We need to give people confidence in the decisions we take.  The approach of Malta, which believes that certain operations may breach its neutrality, would have been a good model for us to follow.  The move towards enhanced military and defence co-operation poses risks for Europe and presents a domestic challenge for our foreign policy if military strategies become part of European Council decision-making.<\/p>  <p>  The successes of the Union have been many.  It has fostered peace on our own island and been instrumental in supporting and negotiating the Good Friday Agreement.  The shared EU membership of Ireland and the UK formed the essential bedrock to the Good Friday Agreement and provided the platform for ever closer alignment and integration of the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland.  The dismantling of customs posts and the creation of cross-Border bodies, often generously funded by the European Union itself, has laid the foundation for peace and strengthened the all-island economy, as a common set of regulatory standards enabled the free movement of goods, services and people on the island.  It also provided a route for the vindication of rights and for the tens of thousands of Irish citizens in Northern lreland an uncertain future lies ahead.  The irony of Northern Ireland unionists who advocated for an EU exit signing up for Irish passports to maintain EU citizenship rights, including the freedom of travel, was lost on no one.<\/p>  <p>  The solidarity shown to Ireland since Brexit has been evidence of the power of membership for a small country like us as fellow members have committed to our objective of resisting the reimposition of anything like a strengthened or hardened border on the island of Ireland.  A further example of that solidarity was when the Prime Minister, Theresa May, sought the support of the EU Council after the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury.  That again was a clear demonstration that by pooling sovereignty we have actually strengthened our position as a country.  This is an option that will be denied to the United Kingdom after next March.<\/p>  <p>  Even as one member leaves, the prospect of growing the Union remains.  There are six possible future members in the western Balkans, including Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.  The EU has been an invaluable partner to peace in Ireland and, with our experience, can play a similar role in the Balkans, an area that has been ravaged, settling down ethnic challenges that have scarred this continent in recent decades.  Ireland must also play its role in fostering the path to peace of those potential new member states.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking to the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, just over a year ago I said that once again winning the citizens of Europe to the European project and giving people enthusiasm for a vision of the potential of Europe requires a genuine recommitment to a framework for a Europe based on equality, personal freedom and prosperity.  It requires EU institutions and leaders to address the problems pressing heaviest on their citizens, in particular stagnant or, in some cases, absent growth and spiralling youth unemployment.  They must once again rekindle the potential of hope for our people.  In other words, I believe we need to reinvigorate the notion of a social Europe.  A Europe that does not recognise the dangers of economic under-achievement throughout this continent will not and cannot win the support of the European people.<\/p>  <p>  Economic under-achievement has fostered a splintering of our politics and a rush to the extremes which repeatedly offer simplistic solutions to real challenges.  We need to debate this and to act upon it.  Prolonged EU austerity has done great damage to the political and social fabric of our Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900050#XX00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525897500,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900050#XX00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1525897500,"counter":520,"content":"<p>As Jean Monnet once argued:<\/p><blockquote>Europe has never existed.

Since the European project began, the integration has occurred.  We have begun to create Monnet's vision of Europe.

Clearly the EU is facing major challenges over the next few years, and the decision of the British people to opt for Brexit has offered an existential challenge to its very existence.  In virtually every EU country, of course, there have been ongoing and long-standing concerns over the levels of democracy, accountability and transparency in the EU's quasi-federal structures.  These concerns have often been too easily dismissed as populism by commentators who, of course, are devoted to the EU project.  The conduct of the bailouts of euro members like Ireland, Greece and Portugal since 2010 has greatly exacerbated these misgivings and reservations among the European electorates.  The great Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance Minister, is now forming his own Europe-wide political party, which we may see in Ireland.<\/p><p>Brexit was a striking response to these concerns, but wide sectors of EU opinion have had similar worries and concerns and even felt revulsion over the treatment of the smaller euro member states.  Rather than deeply examining how these concerns may be addressed in future revisions of the EU treaties, many analysts and journalists simply condemn the fears of the European peoples and label representatives as populist, including those who genuinely want a much more democratic EU.  I am one of those.<\/p><p>At a recent meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight involving Members of the European Parliament, Deputies tried hard to show our European parliamentarians how close the relationship is between Ireland and the UK on personal, cultural, social, economic and political grounds.  Above all, we emphasised the critical joint responsibility of the Irish and British states for the Good Friday Agreement.  At that meeting, we also discussed the proposals for the EU's multi-annual financial framework budget and the likely consequences for Ireland's EU contribution, which is set to reach &euro;3 billion per annum in 2019.<\/p><p>Many other EU countries are also grappling with challenges produced by issues such as the migration crisis, slow economic growth and climate change, to which other speakers have referred.  Ireland has to contend not only with working hard to achieve the least damaging result on Brexit but also with how to respond to the proposals of the French President, Mr. Emmanuel Macron.  President Macron's vision on the future of the EU is clearly a programme for a federal structure, a federation.  In his book <i>Revolution<\/i>and his Sorbonne speech of September 2017, he outlined how he wishes to transfer the sovereignty of the historic French Republic of 1789 to a new republic of Europe, led especially by France and Germany.  He writes:<\/p><blockquote>Faced with the current serious challenges, it would simply be an illusion, and a mistake, to propose to rebuild everything at the national level.  Faced with an influx of migrants, the international terrorist threat, climate change, the digital transition, as well as the economic supremacy of the Americans and the Chinese, Europe is the most appropriate level at which to take action.<\/blockquote><p>Therefore, Macron envisages the end of European nations holding their own sovereignty.  In practical terms, Macron's new European constitution will include an EU finance Minister and a shared EU national debt.  Perhaps we will start calling it continental debt.  Many felt the launching of the euro without an all-Europe debt structure was crazy economics.  Macron's model will certainly involve a common consolidated taxation, CCT, base, including clearly pan-European rules on corporation tax and the Europe-wide digital tax.  Macron also envisages a great deepening of the current PESCO arrangements, which the D&aacute;il recently approved, although 45 of us voted against them, and the creation of a European defence force, a European army.  The President of France seems to want these new structures put in place and a clear path to European sovereignty by 2024, the date of the European Parliament elections after next.  Obviously, Macron's vision depends on German support to go even remotely down this pathway to a federal state.  He seems to accept, however, that an inevitable consequence of this federalist programme will be a multi-speed EU.  A number of states, perhaps including Germany, may join France on a federalist road but other states, although continuing in the EU, will remain outside this core group.  Macron's anti-worker initiatives in France do much to undermine his federalist vision since his domestic policy seems clearly to undermine further the &quot;social Europe&quot; programme, about which Deputy Howlin spoke powerfully.  Social Europe was such an attractive feature of the EU for the first 30 years of Ireland's membership.<\/p><p>It may well be, therefore, that we are heading for a multi-speed EU, with member states in different orbits around states that want a federal structure.  There has always been the issue of deepening or widening.  Deputy Howlin referred to the waiting list of states, such as Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, from the former Yugoslavia, Georgia, Armenia and the Ukraine, and perhaps at some stage Turkey and Russia.  The very best outcome for Ireland in the wake of Brexit would be that the UK would also be one of those outer states.  It would still be orbiting in the European system.  Clearly, the UK will continue to be deeply involved with the EU in areas such as security, policing and scientific research.  Despite the appalling performance of the current Tory Prime Minister and her appalling Government, as evidenced again this morning during Prime Minister's questions, which I glanced at before coming into the House, it is likely that the UK will end up in the customs union, or at least a customs union as proposed by the distinguished representative Keir Starmer of UK Labour Party, whether before or after the next UK general election.  These matters may have to be resolved by a UK general election.<\/p><p>Ireland's critical economic needs and the issue of preventing any border returning in our country make an ongoing close relationship between Ireland and the UK imperative.  Thus, when our own people may have to decide on whether to belong to President Macron's core, if the programme is to go ahead, or to be a close confederal member of the future EU, along the present lines, it will be in our interest to support a multi-speed EU constitution.  In any case, Europe's greatness lies in the differences and unique cultures, wonderful languages and traditions of all its people, or its 40 or 50 nations.  The EU's future evolution should always reflect that essential reality.<\/p><p>I agree with commentators such as Stephen Collins that the Irish Government should engage in a constructive way with President Macron but, given our historical experience, most of our people find his federal vision anathema.  We spent so long as part of the British empire.  Many people would not be attracted to joining a new Carolingian empire, or seeing a restoration of that empire, which, as the Acting Chairman will know, encompassed France, Germany and Italy.<\/p><p>The most pressing realisation now is the growing size of Ireland's EU budget contribution.  We are now one of only nine net contributors to the EU budget and are entering our fifth year as a net contributor.  The 2021-27 EU budget is being set at &euro;1.27 trillion for the 27 remaining EU states and this will now represent 1.11% of the EU GNI.  Commissioner Hogan, a former Deputy, seemed to be seeking 1.2% or even 1.3%.  This type of figure was sought by some of the parliamentarians we met.  While the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, has signalled willingness to support this budgetary programme, many countries such as Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark are opposed to Jean-Claude Juncker's proposal to breach the previously agreed EU budgetary cap of 1% of GNI.  While the British are expected to go on paying into the EU budget past 2021 for critical issues like passporting rights for their financial sector and the EU open skies policy, the additional funding is needed to make up a deficit of up to &euro;12 billion that will be caused by the UK's departure in March 2019.  In 2018, Ireland is making an EU contribution of &euro;2.7 billion and will pay almost &euro;2.9 billion in 2019, a doubling of what we paid just five years ago, when we became a net contributor.  Therefore, we are now a very significant and important pillar of the EU, certainly in financial terms.<\/p><p>This includes a cut of 5% in Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, spending which will profoundly negatively impact on our farming sector.  I think the Minister, Deputy Creed, met his French counterpart earlier this week about this matter because France has a similar view to us.  Ireland's contribution and growing net contribution to the EU budget must be kept under very close scrutiny in the coming years, given that it is now becoming a bigger budget than the budget of many of our Government Departments.  The MEPs we met on the budget committee recently told us how the EU's future budget deficit - at least two thirds - will be financed.  It will not be by cuts but new moneys.  Some of the new money will be additional funding, such as the customs duty that we will be asked to supply.  Our Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the whole D&aacute;il need to keep these financial matters under close observation as well as being supportive of the EU budget.  I believe, despite the awful Tories who are in government in the UK, and hope that there will be a soft Brexit and that there will not be a Border here.  We need to engage with the deep and profound thinking that has been done by people like President Macron about how the European Union will evolve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900051#YY00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525898700,"counter":524,"content":"<p>The Minister of State had a long day with it being Europe Day.  I acknowledge the importance of today, now more than ever before because of the challenges we are facing with Brexit.  We are concentrating more on the new Europe, what we want from it and how we will achieve the goals, aims and aspirations that we as a country have on behalf of the people in different sectors, whether agriculture or tourism, and all of the other problems that we have.  We had a useful exchange this morning which I thought was beneficial and which went down well.  There were maybe 200 or 300 people at that conference event but it was seen and heard around the country and was well reported on.  There was a positive reaction to that.  I and my fellow members of the committee are dealing with issues like this and the future possible expansion of the EU.  Last week, we met with people from the Balkan states.  Today, we had the ambassador from Kosovo.  We had an interesting and useful exchange with him.  We remember the time when Ireland was rightly very welcoming of people in difficult situations.  I recounted a story where my late father insisted on being on the runway in Kerry airport to shake hands with every person who came off the plane from Kosovo.  They got a special clap on the back and he was very welcoming of them.  The ambassador was delighted to hear that story today.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad and heartened to see the results of a recent RED C report which clearly states that 92% of people in Ireland are deeply committed to the EU model and to continuing to be members of the EU.  We are willing to put our shoulders to the wheel to make the new Europe work.  That is what it is all about.  We want it to be a better place for our citizens to live in, for our citizens to move around in and for our young people.  At the end of the day, it is about our young people.  They are the future.  It is important and I encourage every Deputy to get the report, which is county by county.  There is valuable information in it which outlines how each county benefited from being members of the EU over the years.  It is a good synopsis and is beneficial.  I recommend that Deputies who have not seen it get their hands on it and distribute it to their constituents to show that we are benefiting.  We have been good to Europe, Europe has been good to us and we want that to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1525898700,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I am glad to be able to speak on the future of the European Union about which I have concerns, as have many others, for some time.  I have been a campaigner since 1973 when we joined Europe.  The ideas and views, as Deputy Haughey mentioned earlier, went back to the late Se&aacute;n Lemass and many other political leaders here aspired to this, worked for this and helped to bring it about.  We have benefited hugely from Europe for a number of decades but the shoe is on the other foot now with the situation with the evolving Europe and the pull.  Certain countries have taken a huge amount of power, and have neglected and have not listened to ordinary people.  Surveys have shown that.  The most recent European Parliament analysis found that, in the context of the renewed debate on the future of Europe, only 47% of European citizens feel that their voice counts in the EU.  It is the best result since the 2009 European elections.  That is concerning.  Less than half are committed and feel that their voice counts.  We must be ag &eacute;isteacht i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  I should wish everybody a happy Europe Day.  Happy days is right but people are dissatisfied.  If they are not happy and feel they are not listened to, there will be unease and there will be shifts.  There could be seismic shifts in European elections.  We have seen that in many nations.  There have been major shifts because people feel disenfranchised, feel a huge disconnect and are concerned about that.  Over half of the EU's population, of more than 500 million, feels that their voice is not heard.  That is a frightening statistic.  I do not know about the poll but I assume the report is reputable.  It is very concerning that over half feel that, which is more than 250 million people, because 47% are satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the European Commission presented a communication outlining ideas on the future of food and farming.  The communication proposes a number of changes to the CAP, which is important.  The CAP has a major impact on Irish farmers, from the farm to the fork, right down to housewives and the consumers.  The changes to CAP focus primarily on making it simpler and ensuring best value for money.  It is anything but simple, as far as I am concerned, and it is hard to see where the value for money is.  The new CAP wants to establish a system allowing EU countries and regions to fulfil EU goals with their own tailor-made policies.  That is a nice and aspirational paragraph.  That has not been happening.  How will we get the 53% who said they were unhappy and disconnected?  What kind of a tailor will we need to make the suits to fit them to make them think that they are being listened to?  There is much food for thought here.  It is important that we listen or get out to these people.  We do not have the heavy gang who, even after Brexit, went off on a tangent of threatening, even when a sovereign country had a vote to leave the EU.  The same communication gave no details of how much money would be available and if the budget would be affected by the UK's withdrawal.  It is fine to go into the tailor and order a suit but if one does not have money to pay for it, one is in trouble.  We want to have a tailor-made system to establish our own tailor-made design yet we have no idea of what is in the budget.  There are cuts in the budget so we need to be honest with ourselves.  This is very strange.<\/p>  <p>  The multi-annual financial framework revision will also have an impact on the post-2020 CAP.  We know that and are unsure of where that is leading us.  The future CAP will therefore face several financial challenges while having to deliver for farmers.  Several instruments are already available to farmers, such as loan funds.  These can often be very hard for smaller farmers.  We see that with single farm payments.  The smaller farmer often comes out worse after these things.<\/p><p>We have a lot of work to do and the Minister of State has a lot of work to do.  It is very important that we bring the people with us and that the people are listened to, as they are not.  A total of 55% of people in that survey felt disenchanted while only 47% of European citizens feel that their voice counts in the EU.  The British people got lectured from on high after they voted for Brexit.  They got lecture after lecture on how they were not good Europeans.  They had made a sovereign decision.  It has had and will have a huge impact on us so we need to be very conscious of that and support them.  One of the reasons was that they were paying in as well - in fact paying more.  If President Macron gets his way, he will have a Europe that he and a few more will be in charge of, including finances, and the smaller countries will be left out in the cold.  We know that Ireland is now a net contributor, which is a big difference from the early days of the EEC, so it is a big change.  There is a lot of work to be done.  The Taoiseach came back here last December and told us he had cast-iron guarantees - practically bulletproof - that there would be no Border and this, that and the other.  It has evaporated like the snow over St. Patrick's weekend.  We have no guarantees and we are left wondering where it will take us.  I am asking the Minister of State for European affairs to be a strong voice for Ireland.  Above all, we need to listen to concerns unless the Government wants a seismic shift in the next European elections, which are only around the corner.

I am speaking to amendment No. 4.  They go from amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 21.  As I said, it was the Minister who recommitted the Bill.  We are blamed in certain quarters for delaying it but when Deputy Healy-Rae and I attended a committee on a few occasions to try to discuss the amendments, including our amendments, they were not ready, there was no discussion and we did not get great clarity from the Chairman of the committee either.  That is part of the reason for the delay.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, when I was in possession, I was talking about speed cameras, the huge cost, the lucrative contracts that were given out at enormous cost to the State and the poor returns.  I quoted figures and if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not mind, I will quote them again for the record.  The State paid out &euro;88 million to the firms behind these speed cameras and collected &euro;32.7 million from fines paid by motorists.  That is certainly a lot but it is a lot of negative equity for the cost of running the system.  The figures, which were from 2010 to 22 July 2017, were provided to me in a reply to a Parliamentary Question I put to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the speed cameras have a positive effect on reducing the number of road deaths but I also think it is time for a re-examination of the contract if we are spending &euro;88 million and only taking in &euro;32.7 million.  One cannot, of course, put a value on a life and I sympathise with anyone who has lost their life on the road for a myriad of reasons.  It is very traumatic and upsetting.  We all strive to change this but not all of it will or can happen in this Bill.  There are many other areas at which we must look.  There is no doubt about the impact of the camera regime on reducing road fatalities and accidents, particularly in areas that have been blighted by accidents over the years.  I am not suggesting that they be removed but we need a reassessment or audit of the cost, value for money and whether or not they are working other than impacting on motorists.  I feel that where they are located, particularly in a 100 km to 80 km area, an 80 km to 60 km area or a 60 km to 50 km area, it is very hard for a motorist to adjust.  It could all take place within less than 2 km of road.  It is very hard, particularly in some areas where a motorist is driving down a hill.  Cars are faster and quieter and gears are better calibrated to do speeds without any revving of the engine or anything else.<\/p>  <p>  I and several constituents of mine have asked, begged and pleaded for these cameras to be located in accident black spots.  We used to have the black spot sign, which was a black sign with a yellow surround.  Those signs were banished.  They have no bona fides anymore.  We cannot get them up.  They are not relevant.  In some areas, when I was a member of the county council, I am sure my colleagues from the Rural Independent Group like Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae, Deputy Michael Collins and others have had many motions down-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900053#AAA00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525899300,"counter":534,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1525899300,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Where is the pilot?  I hope he is not on the roads.  I have lost my train of thought.  I am questioning the pilot to see how we got into aviation here.  Signs have now been put up but they are black.  We have a limit but they are on a black background.  Again, they have no authority.  They are there as a kind of a warning, which is great, but they have no authority.  It is not a direction.  A motorist does not need to abide by those signs because they have no standing in regulation.  Those black spots are still there, numerous accidents take place but these vans refuse to place themselves in the middle of these areas or immediately adjacent to them for whatever reason.  Sometimes it is said that it is too dangerous to locate them there but I am sure the county council could set up a bay for Garda cars or these vans to be located at accident spots, as it has done on many motorways.  We all know the tragic results of these accident black spots in our counties over decades, possibly nearly 40 years in some areas.<\/p>  <p>  I am questioning the enormous cost associated with operating the Garda safety contract each year.  From 2012 to 2015, it cost the State over &euro;17 million to maintain the contract with a cost of almost &euro;16 million in 2011.  From 2010 to date, revenue generated by the safety contract has totalled &euro;32 million so something is radically wrong there.  Taxpayers' money is being used and paid out but we are not getting a good system.  While people who drive at excessive speed are being punished, and we cannot fight against that, on the outskirts of a town where the limit changes from 100 km to 80 km, 80 km to 60 km, and 60 km to 50 km in a short space of road, it like shooting fish in a barrel because a motorist could be a couple of kilometres over it with different incremental speed signs that change so often.<\/p><p> As I said, the black spots are being ignored - those cameras and those signs.  There is a lot of work for the Minister to do in that area and I am surprised it has not been tackled.  I am not blaming the Minister, Deputy Ross, for it all; his predecessors could have tackled those incremental signs.  The black-spot signs were good warning signs.  I grew up seeing them and inquiring what they were.  A black spot is a dangerous spot and now they will not put them up anymore.  They tell us that the signs are irrelevant.  They have put up signs with a black background, but that sign has no legal standing.  That is very disquieting and pretty unnecessary.<\/p> <p> The Minister is predicating many aspects of the Bill on figures from the RSA, figures from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and figures compiled and supplied back and forward between the Garda divisions and the RSA.  Last week on RT&Eacute; an RSA spokesperson said it had been denied recent figures.   What is going on?  I know the Minister, Deputy Ross, is not the Minister for Justice and Equality, but surely the RSA should not have to be begging for statistics; it should be getting them freely and working in unison to try to tackle this issue.  It is easy to blame learner drivers and others when there are many issues.  Without the figures, people do not have trust.  As I said before, if people do not have trust in the legislation, it will be much harder to police it.  It gives me no joy.<\/p> <p> On the vans, as I said, I would prefer to see that money put into rebuilding the traffic corps, whose numbers have been cut by 50% or more.  Funding for their cars and other specialist equipment has been cut over the years since the recession, but it is now time to beef them up.  I salute the members of the Garda traffic corps in the Tipperary division who do such Trojan work.  However, if they are stopped in an area for any reason - they can stop anywhere they like and they are enforcing the laws of the land - and if there is a robbery or an accident up the road or whatever, they can leave immediately on getting a radio signal and attend to that.  They are there quite fast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050900053#AAA00800","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525899900,"counter":537,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I have listened to discussion of signage and Garda divisions, and they are all valid points in their own right.

I just said I asked him three times and gave him three chances that he might reconsider because it is a very hurtful allegation to make against anyone, never mind elected Members.<\/p>  <p>  I was making the point that the figures, on which the Minister has predicated the Bill, are totally false, erroneous and spurious - one can call them whatever one likes.  It is impossible to expect people to support that because they are totally erroneous.  It gives me no pleasure to say that in my county the breath tests were exaggerated by 380%.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle cannot say I am not allowed to be concerned about that in discussing a road traffic Bill which is making changes in amendments Nos. 4 to 7.  That is not right and we should be conscious of that when we are making legislation.  We will be accused in later years of rushing legislation.  Bad legislation is worse than even rushed legislation.  No explanation has been given for this from the assistant commissioner or anybody else.  I am not blaming the ordinary garda&iacute; on the road or the traffic corps; I am blaming senior people, including the most senior person in Tipperary.  The breath tests were exaggerated by 380%, which is staggering.  The Minister and others expect that we should change the legislation to criminalise people for a lower offence on foot of the appalling vista that is going on up and down the country.<\/p>  <p>  Tipperary is a very proud county and I am very proud of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Tipperary.  We badly need them and need more of them.  We need the traffic corps to be boosted and put back to near its original strength and to give it the tools of the trade to implement the present legislation and then go forward from there.  However, we must have honesty and integrity in respect of the figures on which the Minister has built the Bill.  I do not believe he investigated or even gave a cursory look at those figures because if he did we would not be where we are at present without a full explanation.  While it applies up and down the country, as I said, Tipperary was the worst with figures exaggerated by 380%.  We have to be able to deal with that.  That is what I am concerned about.  I am asking the Minister to withdraw this legislation until he gets explanations about that.

The people with the responsibility to stop drivers on the road are members of the Garda, and they are doing their job.  Somewhere in that office in Thurles, however, the figures grew like wild mushrooms.  A grow house would not expand them as fast.  It would be hilarious if it was not so serious.  We have to have respect, understanding and fairness.  Justice has to be done and be seen to be done.  How can we have the increased penalties for the blood alcohol limit which the Minister is talking about when we have 380% exaggeration?  How can we have any faith in this?  We heard the RSA again at the weekend saying it cannot get figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which had been giving the RSA those figures for a while but which now does not give it any figures.  Something is badly wrong in the system and I have to express my concerns on behalf of the people I represent in Tipperary.<\/p> <p> There are many other areas of road safety.  During the recent storm three people were killed.  A friend of mine - cara liom - was killed by a falling tree, Michael Pyke from Ardfinnan, and two others also died.  We have been pleading for years that every one of the trees on the roadside boundary should be cut back and no new planting should be done on motorways or anywhere else, and they should be required to be planted a fair distance back.  If there is planning for a mast or other obstruction, for safety reasons it should be so many metres back from the road.<\/p> <p> Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Collins have been in the committee in recent days trying to extend the hedge-cutting season because the roads are so dangerous, with restricted view and poor visibility.  There are amendments in regard to cycling and the safety of cyclists.  No one can cycle the roads in rural Ireland, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows that as well as I.  The briars grow out during the heat of June and July and the roads are almost closed in - d&uacute;nta.  I am a member of Farm Contractors Ireland.

The Minister saw it was the wrong design and that there should have been two underpasses and overpasses.  The locals at the time had hired engineering expertise to design the road properly but it is now going to cost tens of millions to correct it.  I do not mind spending tens of millions if it saves one life or a number of lives, but the design is very dangerous.  The Minister saw it and was given the presentation.  It is a long stretch of road from the outside of Carrick-on-Suir, County Kilkenny, and on to Fiddown.  There are other such roads at Clontibret in Monaghan and when coming off the M8 at Cloghabreeda, going south, where the last 3 km is a 2+1 road.  They are terribly dangerous roads and I wonder how some body like the RSA has not insisted they be discontinued.  We have motorways with proper concrete barriers, which have such a grade of concrete that the cars will hop off them if they hit.  The steel wire, however, is lethal, and God help us if it breaks or snaps, as no one knows where it will end up because of the tension in the wire.
