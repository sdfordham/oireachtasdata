I am accompanied by Ms Paula Barry Walsh, deputy chief veterinary officer; Mr. Martin Farrell, principal officer in animal identification and movement division; and Ms Maria Dunne, principal officer in meat and milk policy divisions.<\/p> <p>  I propose briefly to set out the objectives of a sheep identification and traceability system, reflect on the current system in place and set out the rationale for change.  In addition, I will describe the proposed new arrangements and outline the benefits and costs that are associated with these new proposals.<\/p> <p>  The ability to identify and trace animals is critical from an animal health, food safety and animal welfare perspective.  Systems like this support the development of and the veracity of assurances associated with animal and herd health programmes; support disease control activities, including trace back and trace forward; support food safety assurances in areas such as food-chain information and trace back and trace forward in respect of biological, chemical or environmental contaminants in the food chain; and bring accountability in respect of animal welfare.<\/p> <p>  Traceability is, therefore, important from the individual farmer&rsquo;s perspective in protecting and promoting his or her own within farm interests and at industry and indeed societal level, where the actions of one or a few can jeopardise the industry and, indeed, society as a whole.  Good identification and traceability systems support the optimisation of productivity at farm level in areas such as breeding, nutrition, animal health and animal welfare and at industry and societal level in meeting consumers', both domestic and international, and citizens expectations regarding food safety, traceability and quality.  It also supports the targeting and optimising the deployment of resources in risk management interventions by both the industry players and also by the State.  The advancement of new technologies in recent years provides newer and better tools to support these objectives.<\/p> <p>  The current system we have in place for identification and traceability of sheep goes back to 2010.  It is grounded in Council Regulation (EC) No. 21\/2004.  The default position is that sheep must be identified using an electronic identification, EID, system, that is, either an EID tag or a bolus set.  However, there is a derogation available for member states where they may authorise an alternative system in respect of sheep less than 12 months of age that are intended for slaughter and that are not intended for intra-community trade or for export to third countries.  The derogated alternative system is expected to deliver the equivalent levels of assurance regarding traceability.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, sheep must be identified by the age of nine months, or six months in intensive sheep production facilities, or when leaving the holding; be identified with an EID set on reaching 12 months of age; have an EID set of tags if they are presented for slaughter, irrespective of age; by way of derogation they may be identified by way of a single slaughter tag, if less than 12 months of age, where they are moving directly from the holding of origin to slaughter plant; and by way of derogation, they may be identified with a single mart tag, if less than 12 months of age, where being sold at a mart.  That is the current system.<\/p> <p>  A number of further scenarios play out in respect of the animals sold at marts depending on their future destination.  This depends on whether they are going for slaughter, further fattening or breeding.  There are also further additional requirements in respect of loss of tags, in differing circumstances, and in relation to imported animals.<\/p> <p>  With regard to accompanying documentation, the Department provides specific dispatch documents to individual registered flock owners.  This is pre-printed with name, address, flock number and flock identifier, which must be used for any movement of sheep off farm.  It is necessary that the individual 12 digit number of all sheep being moved is clearly and legibly entered on to the document.  This includes the necessary food chain information declaration that must be signed by the farmer.<\/p> <p>  In addition, all flock owners are required to maintain a flock register in which they record the date of tagging, movements onto and off the farm, replacement tags and on-farm deaths.  The system is complex, with multiple and different scenarios associated with the movement and trading of sheep, which gave rise to the Department to produce a 44 page step by step guide, which was provided some years back.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the rationale for change, the current system necessitates the manual transcription of a series of individual 12 digit tag numbers at each point of transaction along the supply chain.  This provides a significant ongoing challenge in the context of an effective traceability system.  The challenges posed have been recognised over years, with a number of instances relating to animal health, environmental contamination and animal medicines, posing particular difficulties for the Department and, therefore, for the industry in tracing back and forward along the supply chain.  While the events in question were all dealt with and eventually contained, the system was found to be particularly ineffective and raised specific concerns in the context of the country&rsquo;s ability to effectively deal with a widespread food safety event or a widespread contagious exotic disease.  A number of internal and external audits have also highlighted concerns about the effectiveness of the current system.<\/p> <p>  Further issues arise in the context of the single farm payment inspections, where numerous non-compliances, potentially contributing to the application of penalties, have been identified due to errors in the accuracy or correctness of data recorded in dispatch documents or flock registers.<\/p> <p>  The Department has also experienced increased detailed inquiries from countries with which we have been seeking to develop market access for Irish sheepmeat, in relation to identification and traceability of sheep.  It is clear to us that the increased focus on the effectiveness and robustness of traceability from a food safety perspective by these countries is informed by systems that other potential supply countries have in place.  These issues have informed commitments in a number of strategic documents which all signalled the need to improve the current system.  There is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to strengthen food safety and traceability and maintain at highest standards.  The FoodWise industry document commits to underpin and further improve Ireland&rsquo;s sheep traceability system and the National Farmed Animal Health Strategy commits to further develop and improve the sheep identification system to better support animal health and food safety assurances and controls.<\/p> <p>  The main elements of the proposed new arrangement may be summarised as follows: the extension of the requirement for EID to all sheep as the standard default position; the implementation of a derogation in respect of sheep less than 12 months of age moving directly from holding of origin to slaughter, which would require a single EID tag rather than an EID set; marts and slaughter plants to act as central points of recording, CPR, thus removing the administrative burden on farmers to transcribe the individual 12 digit tag numbers of each sheep onto the dispatch documents; and the use of a single colour tag to better enable the upgrading of animals if they are kept for breeding rather than going for slaughter.<\/p> <p>  The benefits and costs of the new arrangements can be summarised along the following lines.  It will definitely simplify the system, with reduced complexity associated with tag types and re-tagging of animals currently.  The electronic capture of data will provide readable and accurate records, thus enabling real traceability in respect of the identity of sheep moved.  There will be a reduced administrative burden on farmers in completing dispatch documents where they only have to insert the total number of sheep rather than having to transcribe each individual sheep tag number.  There will be a reduction in errors for farmers at farm level, which currently contribute to penalties under the single farm payment scheme.  There will be a reduced burden on farmers purchasing breeding sheep less than 12 months of age at marts, as the animals will already be identified electronically, and there will be no need for further re-identification when they reach 12 months of age.  It will provide a robust on-farm infrastructural tool across the industry that can be leveraged in areas such as breeding, nutrition and animal health to maximise on-farm productivity.  There will be a reduced administrative burden on marts in that all sheep arriving will be identified electronically.  There will be a reduced administrative burden and errors for dealers purchasing animals at marts for further feeding, as they will all be identified electronically, and there will be no need for further re-identification.  There will be a reduced administrative burden for slaughter plants in that all sheep arriving for slaughter will be identified electronically.  Critically, it will improve the industry's and the State's capacity to effectively respond in a timely, targeted, focused and accurate way to critical animal health and food safety incidents and events.  It will underpin the country&rsquo;s capability in relation to animal health strategies in the context of animal health programmes, surveillance and control.  It will provide the industry with a robust, effective and verifiable traceability system, which can stand scrutiny nationally and internationally from a food safety assurance perspective.  It will facilitate the Department, acting on behalf of the industry, in engaging more proactively in seeking and achieving new market access for Irish sheep and sheep products.<\/p><p> In order to achieve these benefits there are, indeed, additional costs for the industry.  Farmers will incur extra costs associated with EID tags.  For instance, it can be seen in the marketplace at the moment that the marginal cost of an EID tag over a conventional tag is in the region 75 cent.  Marts and slaughter plants will need to invest in technology and infrastructure in order to be in a position to act as central points of recording.<\/p><p> Recognising, in particular, the upfront cost to farmers, the Minister has announced a once-off support payment of up to &euro;50 per farmer to assist in the transition from purchasing conventional tags to buying EID tags.  It is estimated that this will cost the Exchequer up to &euro;2 million.<\/p><p> In addition, the purchase of electronic identification readers and associated software has been included as a measure supported under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  This is budgeted to cost in the region of &euro;1 million.  While tag readers are not essential in the management of a sheep flock, they are invaluable if a farmer seeks to leverage the benefit of EID in effective management, be it in relation to breeding, nutrition, health or husbandry of his or her flock.  This specific support is additional to the sheep welfare scheme, which provides further targeted direct support to the sheep sector in the region of &euro;19 million which falls to be paid in respect of 2017.  I mention in the context of the knowledge transfer programmes under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 that 4,000 sheep farmers are participating, with a payment of &euro;750 per farmer for those participating.<\/p><p> The Minister and Department officials have met with and have been in contact with the various stakeholders over recent weeks since the announcement in respect of some specific concerns in order to work through practical issues that still remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Blake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Blake.

The announcement by the Minister last month that electronic tagging will be extended to all sheep is a necessary step to further underpin our sheep traceability system and will put the sector on a sound footing for future development.  Our breeding ewe flock has been electronically identified now for many years, as has a proportion of lambs from certain producers.  From 1 October this year, the full picture will be completed.<\/p> <p>  The extension of EID to all sheep ensures that Ireland keeps pace with our competitors and with developments in other major sheep producing member states in the EU.  Northern Ireland has had full electronic identification in place for over a decade and France, England, Scotland and Wales have all moved to full EID several years ahead of us.  It is important that we make this move now.  Furthermore, our national cattle identification and traceability system is recognised internationally as world class.  It is, therefore, imperative that our sheep identification and traceability system should also be of an international standard.  Bringing it to that standard will profoundly increase Ireland&rsquo;s prospects of opening up access to new international markets.<\/p> <p>  The move to full EID of all animals in the sheep sector will undoubtedly reinforce our national traceability system, which is based on one tag for life and individual animal identification.  Certain aspects of the current regime require improvement.  To the extent that the current systems falls short of best international practice, it is imperative that any deficiencies identified, which could undermine full and complete traceability, must be corrected immediately.  MII strongly believes that the electronic identification of sheep is the best remedy to these deficiencies.<\/p> <p>  Using electronic identification tags and technology has many advantages.  One is that it offers another form of identification for each animal.  Sometimes conventional tags get lost, dirty, covered by wool or hair, become snagged on a fence and so on whereas EID tags are small and are designed for high retention rates.  Another benefit is that an animal can more easily be identified by scanning the tag with a reader rather than needing to have the animal completely still to read a conventional tag number.  Scanning EID tags, rather than writing down conventional tag numbers, is a tremendous benefit to farmers in saving time and minimising errors.  Electronic identification means individual animals can be monitored through their entire life cycle via an electronic ear tag.  Performance of animals and flocks can be better monitored, measured and responded to and the input of resources can be better managed to ensure profits are maximised.<\/p> <p>  Electronic sheep identification, therefore, has both identification and traceability benefits as well as management benefits.  Apart from overall flock performance monitoring and improved information for breeding decisions, more routine weighing and sorting tasks can also be made easier.<\/p> <p>  MII is firmly of the view that this underpinning of our sheep identification and traceability system, through EID, is critically important to the positioning of Irish lamb in the market place and to competing for key customer accounts.  In the first instance, it is important in respect of maintaining our existing customer base for Irish lamb.  Systems of traceability and processing operations are continuously audited by major customers and by independent third parties and as we export over 80% of our overall sheepmeat production, we must ensure that our traceability regime is of international calibre and can stand up against our competitors who will be competing in the same international markets that Ireland is targeting.<\/p> <p>  In this regard, MII and its members are working actively with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to progress access to new international markets such as the US, Japan and China.  The move to full EID, which reinforces our traceability system, is an important enabler to progressing these applications and, ultimately, delivering new international market access opportunities for Irish lamb exports.<\/p> <p>  I wish to emphasise that full electronic identification of sheep will bring significant benefits to the sheep sector.  These include: facilitating farmers in their flock management, performance recording and improving flock register accuracy on the farm; full EID will greatly enhance the accuracy and flow of information to Sheep Ireland for its important work in sheep breeding and genomics; it will assist in bringing greater efficiency to handling sheep at farm, livestock mart and processing plant level; and, critically, in bringing the benefits of modern technology to the sector, it will contribute to far greater robustness to the identification and traceability of sheep and improve our prospects of securing new international markets for Irish lamb.<\/p> <p>  As I said at the outset, MII believes that the move to full electronic identification of all sheep later this year is an important step forward for the sector and will see the completion of a very comprehensive animal identification system for the sheep sector in Ireland.

This is a good thing and it is the direction we need to go in.  It is a move in the right direction in terms of opening up new markets, helping to sustain markets and ensuring we have correct and full traceability.<\/p> <p>  As we know from recent reports from Teagasc on farm livelihoods, many in the sheep sector are on the lower end of the scale and are making the least amount of money for the efforts they are making.  They see this as an additional cost and the question is whether that will provide an additional return greater than the cost.  That is the issue most farmers have.  I know from speaking to sheep farmers that none really has a problem with this other than the cost.  It will be an extra cost on them and they fear they will not get the full return.  That is really the issue.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Blake said the Department has been in contact with the stakeholders since the announcement.  Deputy McConalogue and I met the Minister almost a year ago and he told informed us this was coming down the road.  Were the stakeholders not kept informed prior to the announcement?  Was there no consultation up to that point?  I would like confirmation in that regard because some of the farm organisations have said they have not been kept informed as well as they would like to have been.<\/p><p>The issue seems to be that, in general, lambs have relatively short lives.  The cost of the tag for the time it is on the farm if it is going straight to slaughter is an issue.  I would like to have clarity on that issue.  As far as I can see, this is good and the way forward.  The best answer is the sheep scheme.  If it was made an additional action under the scheme, it would compensate farmers who would know they were getting something back from it.  It is regrettable.  The Minister will be here later.  While we are not talking about that issue now, it is part of what we are talking about.  It would at least show some sense of trying to do something for the farmer.  There has to be recognition that the sheep sector is under pressure.  It has one of the lowest levels of profitability in farming.  <\/p><p> I thank the delegates for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#E00500","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>There is a very good submission from the IFA.  Other farming organisations have expressed concerns.  This submission deals with the concerns expressed and makes some practical proposals.  The IFA asserts that the main beneficiaries of this decision are the meat factories.  It has brought to our attention a number of non-statutory charges imposed on farmers.  I reaffirm the points made by Deputy Martin Kenny about the very low incomes of sheep farmers across the State.  Some of the non-statutory charges are a scrapie levy which is 80 cent to &euro;1.05 per ewe and an SRM levy of &euro;1.27 to &euro;1.30.  These charges are additional to the departmental vet charge of 50 cent per head, the Bord Bia levy of 25 cent per head and the Sheep Ireland levy of 7 cent per head.  What they are calling for is an instruction to the meat factories to abolish the non-statutory scrapie levy and the SRM levy imposed on sheep farmers at the factories.  I would like a response from Mr. Carroll and Mr. Healy on that matter.<\/p> <p>  One of the big criticisms of the Department expressed by the farming organisations and sheep farmers is the lack of consultation.  It is alarming that the Department announces something like this and consultation takes place afterwards.  Why was there no consultation?  Why did the Minister feel he had to invite the IFA and other farming organisations to make submissions and be involved in this matter?  <\/p> <p>  The submission raises additional issues such as the underspend under the sheep welfare scheme.  The submission asks about its reallocation.  I assume Mr. Blake and Mr. Farrell have seen the submission.  What is their response to it?  The IFA also raises additional issues, including market access and animal welfare.  Apparently, there is an issue for hill sheep farmers when it comes to EID tagging.  The submission also states the Department has confirmed that it has no plans to introduce a full individual database for sheep identification purposes.  I would like a response on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#F00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from the Department and Meat Industry Ireland for their submissions.  It is the old story.  If something is good for farmers, it will be good for the industry and the cost will be thrown back on farmers to bear.  We are talking about a very low income sector.  It is the imposition of a significant cost on farmers.  Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn referred to the IFA's submission.  If one considers lambs coming off the hills, they vary in price from &euro;35 to &euro;50 per head.  It is, therefore, a very significant part of the sale price.  It is probably the lowest income sector in the industry.  We are talking about 3% to 4% of the value of the output being the cost of the tag.  Monitoring flock performance was mentioned.  This is a flock tagging system.  There will be no ability to identify traits that could improve the genetic performance of the flock.  This is to identify lambs going to slaughter and will mean far greater traceability.  We then have the arguments about keeping pace with our competitors.  What are the New Zealanders and Australians doing?  What traceability systems do they have?  Every time we feel we want to secure greater market access, we go back to the primary producer, on whom we place a greater onus and extra cost.  Unfortunately, the margin of the primary producer is shrinking.<\/p> <p>  No one can argue about the benefits and our customers will love it.  In the past few months we have secured access to the market in China.  There are conditions attached to that market access.  When it arrives there, our food produce can be left in unrefrigerated conditions, but that does not mean that China does not want our meat plants to be seven star, all of which cost comes back to the primary producer.  As Deputy Martin Kenny said, one cannot argue against the benefits, but one can definitely argue against how the primary producer will carry the cost.  Imposing this extra cost on the primary producer is not practical or sustainable.  <\/p> <p>  There is a significant underspend under the sheep welfare and other schemes.  The Minister has to step up to the plate.  The underspend under the sheep welfare scheme is significant.  Funding has to be found to underwrite the cost this will impose on sheep farmers.  The hills are being abandoned in sheep farming.  The sector is on a knife edge and very few young farmers are entering it.  It will be to no one's benefit, from a sustainability point of view or when the preservation of the landscape is considered, if the hills do not continue to be farmed.  Imposing such a cost on this extremely low income sector cannot be allowed.  We cannot just say it is for the good of the industry and that the primary producer will carry the cost, although we cannot argue about the benefits.  Our customers will love it, but they do not care about the extra cost they place on us.  The attitude is that it will be done by the industry and that it will carry it.  We saw the same happen in the case of quality assurance measures.  The cost is placed on us and we are told that it helps us to sell in the marketplace, but a primary producer sees little extra in his or her pocket for it, if anything.  We can be told that we will lose market share because of it.  As a result of Brexit, will these requirements be placed on the New Zealanders and Australians entering the European market?  In the beef industry we do not see this pressure being exerted on imports from South America.  They can be imported with virtually no traceability, even though we have to measure up to the highest possible standards.  It has been said there will be benefits from a flock point of view in increasing productivity, while from a cost compliance perspective, it will probably reduce the margin for error.  However, I think the Department will find a way around it. <\/p> <p>  Leaving that aside, there are benefits, but expecting the primary producer to bear the costs is not acceptable.  There is an underspend under the sheep welfare scheme.  The Minister has to step up to the plate to carry the cost of tagging.  It is for the good of the industry.  Meat Industry Ireland is adamant that it will give us greater access to markets, even though some of our competitors can bring in produce without any traceability and seemingly gain access to lucrative markets.  That is a battle about which we could argue all day.  It is a high percentage of the sale price.  If this was happening in the beef industry, we would be talking about &euro;20 per tag for a calf.  That is the comparison and the context in which we have to consider it.  If we want to move the industry forward - we will not argue that there are no benefits - the primary producer cannot be expected to carry the cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#F00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529418600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Kenny, among other members, raised the issues of costs and stakeholder engagement.  I shall deal with these two matters first.<\/p> <p>  Nobody disputes that there is a cost involved.  It is not the Department's intention to just add costs to the meat industry; we are actually looking to support it and make it more efficient.  We are looking to modify the current system because it does not work.  We are trying to underpin it in dealing with food safety and animal health issues.  This not for the good of the Department; the expectation is that if we have a new tool to support the industry, it is good to be able to support it and the food chain with food assurances.<\/p> <p>  We have made some calculations of the cost per farm.  Based on the current pricing system, a 100 ewe lowland flock, for example, will incur an additional cost in the region of &euro;75 to &euro;78.

There are two markets, in particular, to which we are seeking access and in one case it has put some quite hard questions to us about how it wants Ireland to ensure traceability in cases of recall.  That was at the end of last year and we have not yet been able to answer the questions.  In another case, in which we have made a market access application, it has been acknowledged by the country in question that Ireland has traceability issues and it has asked us to resolve them as we progress the application.  As has been said, the current system is not working because it does not deliver the assurances third countries ask for, especially on animal health and food safety risks.  The Minister's announcement is particularly opportune in helping the sheep industry to capitalise in gaining market access for the future.  We hope to continue to gain market access and increase the numbers of countries to where sheepmeat can be exported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Barry Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529418600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I will take up some of the points raised.  Deputy Martin Kenny asked if the system would give an additional return, while Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn quoted from an Irish Farmers Association submission that the meat factories were the only ones to benefit.  I shall address the two points together.  Meat Industry Ireland believes the entire sheep sector will benefit from this measure.  The entire sheep sector is dependent on traceability which underpins food safety in the system.  If there are shortcomings that lead to an issue, we all know from previous examples that the entire sheep sector, every stakeholder and all actors in the chain, including the farmer, the livestock mart and the meat plant, can be impacted on.  This solidifies our approach to traceability in the entire sheep sector and it is of benefit to everybody.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues, on which we have touched, such as the unfortunate reality that gaining market access is a challenging task.  It is a time consuming and lengthy operation to gain international market access, but this measure is one we have to take in taking the next steps to achieve a number of target markets.<\/p> <p>  Without question, a system in which all sheep are electronically identified has certain management benefits at farm level, no more than at mart and meat plant levels, as opposed to the system in operation in which the entire ewe breeding flock and rams are electronically identified.  A number of other flocks of individual producers have taken the electronic identification route and seen certain advantages.  Some of these producers may be involved more in breeding programmes or on the pedigree side of the business, but other large commercial sheep farmers have also taken the step.  There are benefits across the board.<\/p> <p>  On the overall returns, market access and ensuring the recovery of a premium price from the market, it is all about ensuring there are no slip-ups in the existing customer base and markets we already serve.  As Mr. Carroll said in his opening statement, the meat industry is constantly audited by customers and independent third party auditors who look at every facet of the system.  In the past some shortcomings in the traceability arrangements were identified and they will not be overlooked forever.  We must retain our customer base and then expand into international markets.<\/p> <p>  The Department has indicated the numbers in international markets that are open to lamb imports, but they are behind the figures for pigmeat and beef.  To some extent, lamb producers might be a little late to the table in the international market arena, but they are very much focused on international markets now because of changes in them, one of which is the increasing demand for lamb in certain markets.  Another is the more significant development in the past decade of an increase in the volumes of lamb that previously would have come to Europe from New Zealand and Australia being diverted to China.  That has opened up new opportunities which we have to go after.  We believe Ireland has an advantage in that regard.  As we have said at this committee before, it is all about trying to maximise use of every individual piece of the carcass.  In many cases it is about heading into some of the new markets in Asia and so on.  There will be an underpinning of returns.<\/p><p>The overall price return in the course of this year to date has been strong.  Where the markets and the demand exist, it can be delivered.  We need to underpin it and find new markets to follow up on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>A question comes to mind which Deputy Cahill referenced earlier.

In the first instance, our primary focus remains the European market.  When we talk about immediate competitors, we note that our colleagues in England, Scotland, Wales and France have moved along the electronic identification route.  Our first immediate competitor is probably UK lamb in continental markets.  We are competing toe to toe with the UK in those markets.  As major global suppliers of sheepmeat, Australia and New Zealand do not have a similarly elaborate traceability system.  It is a frustration but the reality is that they had market access in Europe and many other international markets, in particular the USA, long before there was any discussion of tagging sheep, not to mention electronic tagging.  Unfortunately, and perhaps the Department can elaborate on this point, getting into a market ahead of particular developments or rule changes is one thing, but trying to get market access after those developments have taken place is another.  We are confronted with that fact and must demonstrate our bona fides on traceability.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also made a point as to whether an identification system delivered benefits for breeding.  We understand from Sheep Ireland that there are benefits.  There is individual identification of the animals.  Breeding flocks and pedigree flocks have probably gone down this route already based on work we have done with them in providing data to Sheep Ireland.  If the sheep sector is to get some of the breeding benefits seen in the dairy sector, which are now starting to come through in the beef sector, this system will be of assistance in providing accurate information.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned other charges related to scrapie and so on.  Those are completely unrelated to the topic under discussion.  They are related to particular regulatory costs that apply.

We will be able to use those data at individual animal level, which will take us a step further and allow us to enter into more refined traceability systems and targeting.

We have found that the current system does not work, which is part of the rationale for change.  The new system will give us a greater handle on that and allow us to deploy resources in a better way.

We have seen that in the case of beef.  It has taken many years to get that over the line and to negotiate those standards to get something that is somewhat equivalent to what one might want to export to other member states.  As Mr. Healy said, the tradition of tagging did not exist in the past, but we face that standard now and must reach it.  It is also interesting to note that Victoria in Australia, which is a large production area, has actually moved to mandatory electronic identification.  A process is commencing there.

The bottom line, however, is that farmers have been asked to pay and are not happy about it.  All farmers have had a tough year, particularly in the sheep sector, which, as colleagues have said, is not one of the high profit farming sectors.  Sheep farmers where I am from always face issues and problems, including viability.  Someone from Meat Industry Ireland said the whole sheep sector will benefit.  I think it was Mr. Carroll.  While I accept that, there is only one pillar of the industry being asked to pay along with the taxpayer the &euro;50 being proposed.  Some members of the committee were in Brussels to hear about issues around the weak position of farmers in the food supply chain and about how they are always an easy target.  They have little bargaining power and, in a case like this, the costs fall to be borne by them.  Is that correct?  Is the meat industry paying towards this in some way?  It is all very well to herald the measure and tell us it is much needed, but farming is all about margins.  Something either helps or goes against those margins, whether it is fertiliser or commodity prices.  Farmers are making a fair point about who is carrying the cost here.<\/p> <p>  An underspend of approximately &euro;5 million has been identified at a time when a cost of &euro;50 per farmer has been proposed.<\/p><p>We are all for the modernisation of all sectors and we want to have the best agriculture and be the best food producers in the world but we have to support the primary producers.  Some of the sheep farmers I meet tell me they cannot see the next generation taking up the mantle and carrying on with sheep farming.  It is the same with suckler cows.  This will be a serious issue.  Until now people have carried on through family tradition but young people, thankfully, have many more options available to them through education and training and farming is not a very attractive prospect.  If we keep hammering farmers bit by bit, at some stage we will have the straw that breaks the camel's back.  We are told by the Government and the Commissioner that everything is being done to help farmers but this is a backward step.  It might not be the biggest step ever but it has a cumulative effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#H01500","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  As has been stated by every previous speaker, it is hard to argue against the positives of the scheme but we are hearing the positives from one side of the fence and we are duty-bound to represent all interested parties.  We have had a bit of lobbying from the farm side and points have been made about the cost.<\/p> <p>  I would like the witnesses from the Department and Meat Industry Ireland to flesh out a few different items.  They have been covered to some extent already, but I would still like to hear them being fleshed out a little more.  I am not an expert when it comes to sheep or sheep breeding, but improved traceability has been mentioned.  How will the introduction of EID help or improve genomics or genetics?  Leaving aside the purebred breeders who will do things a hell of a lot differently from the average sheep farmer, I will use the example of combined flocks running on commonage on a mountain.  There is a variety of rams of different breeds.  Even on lowland farms breeders run their ewes with a ram or two and then, three weeks later, will run them with another ram.  I know from experience of old, and from hearing different stories, a badly doctored wether can do as much damage as a ram on any farm.  Unless we start recording the parentage, will the witnesses explain to me how EID will improve genomics and genetics in the herd other than it being a box-ticking exercise for potential customers?<\/p> <p>  It was also mentioned that one of the advantages for farmers of an electronic identification for sheep would be that marts and factories would become central points of recording.  Does this mean that if sheep are EID tagged, the sheep farmers can load up their trailers in the morning without doing any paperwork and go to the factory and, down the line, when it comes to flock registering or schemes the Department will accept the printouts received in the mart or factory?  If there happens to be a mistake, a clerical error or a typo, who will pay the penalty if it causes issues for the farmer down the line with the Department?  The farmers can show the factory printout and ask whether this is how the new scheme is working.  What obligation will be on the marts or factories to supply farmers with this information?  Will the factory or mart printout or email that is in the farmer's records be accepted by the Department?  The question I am grappling with most in basic terms is what will change under EID with regard to lambs produced for Easter in a short space of time and going directly from the farm where they were born to the factory without going through a dealer or any other holding.  In simple terms, what will change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#J00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the departmental officials and Meat Industry Ireland for coming before the committee to present to us.  The issue has been well discussed, and my apologies for having to leave during the presentations but I read them in advance.<\/p> <p>  As has been well outlined by other members, this move is not something to which people object as such, it is the fact the cost is to be borne by farmers and primary producers.  We see this right across the food chain and various sectors.  Too often, the farmer must bear the brunt of costs.  When margins get squeezed it filters down to the farmer who takes the full whack.  This will be the case again with the costs of tagging.  As has been outlined, the cost of this move to hill farmers in particular adds up to 3% or 4% of the cost of a lamb.  This is too much to ask in what is an exceptionally marginal and, in many cases, non-profitable enterprise.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, from an administration point of view, there will be a cost saving, in particular, for marts and meat factories.  I have a question for Meat Industry Ireland on the level of the cost saving that will arise as a result of reduced administration.  Is it willing to make a financial contribution towards it?  Has Meat Industry Ireland had conversations with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard?<\/p> <p>  I emphasise to the Department something that has been mentioned by other speakers, which is the funding left over from the implementation of the sheep welfare scheme.  The Minister's &euro;50 contribution is no more than a sop.  It is recognition there will be a significant cost but it is no more than a token from him.  It will leave the ongoing costs with the farmers after the initial purchase of tags.<\/p> <p>  My next question for Meat Industry Ireland is on the opening up of markets.  Are there specific markets on which it feels this system will make a very definite impact and might be a clincher with regard to actually getting access to them?  Perhaps the Department will also comment on this.  The bottom line is we are indicating this will mean more markets for farmers and, potentially, better prices.  It is a difficult question but will the witnesses indicate what will be the benefit to farmers in terms of the prices in those additional markets?  Ultimately, we are asking farmers to take a hit on their margins and to factor the cost of electronic tagging into their cost base.<\/p> <p>  Will the Department and Meat Factory Ireland outline exactly the difference the system will make for a batch of lambs going directly from flock of origin to a factory?  They will all go into the factory with one flock number.  How will this make a real difference to them?  Is it really necessary to include this category of lamb?<\/p> <p>  Is an individual identification animal ID and sheep ID database being considered by the Department?

I followed the debate earlier and I welcome the Department officials and the representatives from Meat Industry Ireland.  I will make a couple of points.  I have to agree with Senator Paul Daly on the issue of the Department accepting readouts.  The witnesses state it will save on cross-compliance and administration for farmers.  Will the Department definitively state that the readouts from the factories or marts will be acceptable for cross-compliance and later traceability?<\/p> <p>  This whole system is about one word, namely, \"trust\".  The purpose is to ensure consumers can have trust in where they get their products.<\/p><p> Witnesses from both the Department and Meat Industry Ireland used the word \"traceability\" a number of times.  As a sheep farmer, as far as I am concerned, traceability finishes at the factory floor.  If Deputy Cahill buys two lamb chops in a supermarket, he will not know where the lamb came from, what its parentage was, what breed of lamb it was, whether it was a crossbreed or a purebred or anything else.  If he wants to find out where his lamb comes from, he could come to me and I would sell him a box of lamb killed in a small abattoir.  Then he would know where the two lamb chops he will eat for his dinner tonight came from.  A customer in any of the shops or supermarkets will pick up a small pack of lamb featuring a nice picture of a farmer with his few lambs and sheepdog and will believe the farmer pictured is the producer of the two little lamb chops in the packet.  However, that will not be the case because the farmer in question will not be able to produce so many lambs.<\/p><p> There is, therefore, no traceability for consumers from the moment a lamb enters a meat factory to the point at which it is placed on the counter of a supermarket.  I would love the packaging for lamb to feature labels such as, \"From a crossbred sheep\", \"From a black-faced mountain sheep\", \"From a Suffolk sheep\", \"From a purebred Texel\" or \"From a Texel cross\", as occurs with beef products.  A premium is paid for Angus and Hereford beef.  This type of premium is not possible in the sheep sector because the industry does not want to keep track of lambs after they have been broken down into their individual parts.  Traceability would allow customers to know where the lamb they buy comes from.<\/p><p> As I stated, the proposed system is based on trust.  As a producer, I must assume the cost of the new electronic identification tags to ensure my flock will meet the compliance requirements of the meat factories.  How much will the factory do to ensure customers are able to identify the lamb that I watched being born and which I reared, tagged, brought to the factory and then lost sight of, as it were, because the customer cannot trace it from his or her plate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#J00500","speaker":"1438","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Senator Mulherin wanted to make a brief point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#K00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I intended to refer to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's audit report, the summary of which I have to hand.

My understanding of this issue, on which some of the farming organisations have made a case, is that the reason for the deficiencies lies with the Department's inspections in some of the factories.  This returns me to my question as to why it is only the farmer who must bear the cost of this system.  Fairness demands more creative thinking about sharing the cost.

We have outlined, and people generally accept, that the scheme will have benefits for the overall sector.  The industry's role is to ensure the maximum price is paid and we are held to account on that basis every day.  If an issue with our traceability system resulted in a loss of market or loss of customers that impacted on price, we would be quickly taken to task.  Part of the benefit of the system is ensuring we maximise the return from the marketplace.<\/p> <p>  It is not only farmers who are investing.  The industry must constantly invest in its systems.  If marts and factories are to operate as the central points of recording, CPRs, the industry will have to invest further.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about cost savings.  Unfortunately, I do not necessarily believe the industry will achieve cost savings from electronic tagging.  If the industry acts as the CPRs, as is planned under the new system, more readers will be required.  We do not expect to achieve staff savings through the reading exercise.  What it will do is ensure we know that our reading and recording are done accurately in future.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked questions about breeding.  I will not attempt to speak in great detail about breeding technology and science, other than to say that a fundamental aspect of breeding programmes is to have accurate data at the base.  I understand the points the Senator made on individual rams and groups of rams and how one determines parentage.  I have limited knowledge of this area.  We have a relationship with Sheep Ireland, which is the breeding organisation that forms part of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation  ICBF.  We also work with farmers on a Sheep Ireland committee.  I understand some flocks are being monitored.  There are pedigree flocks and performance monitoring flocks.  These are operating on the basis of individual electronic tag identification of the sheep and we are recording that data and feeding them back to Sheep Ireland.  I will not comment on anything that reinforces the overall quantity of data and their accuracy as a base line because I do not know the ins and outs of the process.  However, the Senator asked some relevant questions on the issue.<\/p> <p>  Two members asked related questions.  Senator Paul Daly asked how the new system will affect Easter lamb and Deputy McConalogue spoke about animals that are brought directly from the farm of origin to the factory.  As I stated, a certain proportion of animals are electronically identified at present.  The ewe flock in its entirety is identified, as is imported lamb and lamb from a number of commercial farms.  Traceability for animals that are brought directly to factories is relatively straightforward, as members indicated.  We need to move to a single system.  There are issues with many other lambs, however, because lambs brought directly from farms to the slaughterhouse do not  for all or even the majority of lambs.  If we are moving to electronic identification, it will be logical to have one system.<\/p> <p>  As the Department outlined, marts and factories would operate as central points of recording.  I will allow the officials from the Department to answer the questions on tag readouts, cross-compliance, etc.  We are working through the detail of how this will be done because it will require some changes in meat plants and marts.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lawlor asked a number of questions.<\/p><p>I will leave the question on cross-compliance to the Department.  Traceability is not only about marketing and linking to a breed.  It is also a regulatory requirement.  It is not only factories imposing a specific requirement.  Council Regulation No. 21\/2004 Brussels lays down specific rules and requirements for traceability and identification.  It is not industry's doing.<\/p><p> I do not accept Senator Lawlor's argument that traceability stops on the slaughterhouse floor.  Once an animal goes to the cutting plant it goes to a batch phase, as is the system throughout the world.  A group of animals is then brought into the cutting plant and dealt with on a batch system.  Should there be an issue with product on the retail shelf or with the consumer that requires trace-back, the product is traced back to the batch of production in the cutting plant and then to the individual lambs that were supplied to the plant.  There is traceability but, as I indicated, it operates on a batch basis.  Unfortunately, we do not take it to the level of a packet of two lamb chops.  However, given that 3 million sheep are slaughtered per annum, that is not necessarily doable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>If a farmer must provide traceability for an individual animal, why can consumers not be able to trace a product back to an individual animal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#L00200","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529418600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>That would only be achievable if every individual carcase was deboned separately.

A farmer does not go to a factory and negotiate.  He takes what he can get.  I accept that the price sheep farmers have got has increased; that is known.  However, across the board there is very little differential in prices between various factories and what they offer on a Monday morning when a farmer brings his animals for slaughter.

The new system provides infrastructure through which people can address breeding issues, which they could not do up to now.  This infrastructure will allow people to consciously engage in breeding practices and to plan breeding, which was not possible in the past because we did not have an individual identification system.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lawlor also raised the issue of how we foresee the system working.  A farmer will turn up at a factory with a document and will no longer be required to write in the 12-digit number.  He will have a dispatch document from the Department, as is currently the case, in which he will enter the number of sheep he is delivering.  He will sign the document, as he does now, and once it is scanned at the factory or mart he will receive a printout of the tag numbers.  He could have 20 numbers and he must verify that the printout coincides with his understanding of what he has delivered.  That will be acceptable in the context of farm records for cross-compliance purposes.<\/p> <p>  In the context of what is different between the new system and the old system in terms of animals moving directly from farm to slaughter, we have taken a policy decision to implement an electronic identification, EID, system.  This means all our traceability and identification will be based on an EID system which allows data capture.  That is the only difference.  The animal moving from farm to slaughter will still have a single tag.  However, it will be a single electronic tag that allows it to be read into the plant, and that is captured at the level of the individual animal number.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue raised a number of issues on the cost of the system to the farmer.  We acknowledge that there is a cost to the farmer.  The Minister has announced a contribution of &euro;50 on the basis of a 100-ewe lamb flock at a cost of &euro;75 to &euro;78 per year.  Our plan for developing the animal identification and movement, AIM, database to capture the individual information is on our agenda.  It is intended to develop an AIM database to capture individual animal identification.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mulherin raised the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, report.  The report is based on a view of the current system.  It and other audits fed in to our discussion in the context of where we need to move to.  The system is not working and needs to become seamless and frictionless.  It is based on paper records and people writing things down.  The fundamental problem in terms of introducing a traceability system is the lack of readability and accuracy of manual records.  We have plenty of examples of sheets arriving at a slaughter plant that are not readable.<\/p><p>It is very hard to expect someone delivering 300 sheep to a slaughter plant to sit down and accurately transcribe 12 digits 300 times.  The fundamental problem with the traceability system is that it is based on such records.

The programme runs up to the end of 2020, though some existing multi-annual commitments may run beyond this date as I will explain later.<\/p> <p>  The substantial investment required over the lifetime of the programme will help to underpin continuing growth and development in rural Ireland and forms part of the vision for strengthened rural economies and communities as contained in the Government&rsquo;s recently launched Project Ireland 2040.  The range of measures and supports available under the rural development programme is extensive.  These include advice, training, payments for public goods, support for on-farm investment, support for animal welfare, initiatives to encourage innovation, partnerships and membership of producer groups and support for local projects under Leader.  Delivering on such a diverse programme is challenging and I am delighted to say that Ireland is performing very well in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Of all European Union member states, we are second overall in terms of drawdown of European Union funds to date.  Our drawdown of European Union funds, at 53%, is well above the European Union average of 33% and we are one of only two member states to have passed the 50% mark.  Our reputation in Europe is 'to leave no euro behind' and I am confident that this will continue under the current rural development programme.<\/p> <p>  At the outset of the rural development programme, indicative allocations were included in the financial plan, in line with identified priorities.  It is against these allocations that my Department conducted its review, using expenditure to date and best estimates of future projections to determine whether the entire budget would be spent.  They found that some measures will meet their allocation, others will exceed it and still more will not spend it in full.  I will start by updating on the overall budgetary situation before commenting on the main individual schemes.<\/p> <p>  It is expected that almost all of the entire &euro;4 billion allocation will be spent by the end of 2020 with some spend in 2021.  However, under European Union regulations governing the programme, funds for multi-annual commitments entered into by the end of 2020 may be claimed up to the end of 2023.  Rural development programme spending is, of course, also subject to the annual Estimates process and budgetary rules.  Based on current projected spending across all schemes under the programme, this required carryover to the next rural development programme to cover our commitments under our multi-annual schemes will be &euro;105 million.  In other words, we are currently committed to spending &euro;105 million over and above the &euro;4 billion allocation to the rural development programme.  Added to this will be a possible areas of natural constraint, ANC, allocation of &euro;227 million for 2021, bringing the total carryover required to &euro;332 million.<\/p> <p>  Transitional funding arrangements are the norm between programming periods and an indicative figure of &euro;637 million was included in this rural development programme to cover commitments from the previous one.  Increasing the commitments to be funded as part of these transitional arrangements would not be the prudent thing to do in my opinion, given the different circumstances which apply to the next proposed programme, for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the transitional funding arrangements to be put in place between this programme and the next are not yet decided at European Union level.  More important though, the recently published multi-annual financial framework proposal to 2027 indicates a cut to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget, under the impact of Brexit and competing priorities.  In light of this the introduction of new measures or entrants to current schemes is not possible at this stage.<\/p> <p>  Turning to individual schemes and supports, I will address those which have attracted the most commentary in terms of original allocation, participation and projected spending.  I am, of course, open to questions on other measures within the programme but for now will deal with these which appear to be of most interest.<\/p><p> I will start with GLAS, our highly successful agri-environmental scheme which is expected to deliver significant environmental and climate friendly benefits as a result of farmer action and engagement.  When GLAS was opened, it was hoped at the time that 50,000 farmers would join the scheme and that milestone was reached sooner than expected in December 2017.  The indicative budget at the time of &euro;1.4 billion included an amount of &euro;390 million for legacy agri-environmental schemes under the previous rural development programme, RDP, the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the agri-environment options schemes, AEOS.  This was to honour our commitments to those farmers who were participants in these schemes.  The total expected combined spend on GLAS and these measures is &euro;1.4 billion, as originally indicated, and no savings are projected.  As of today, over 99% of all eligible GLAS participants are fully up to date with their GLAS payments and weekly pay runs are continuing.<\/p><p> The beef data and genomics programme is an ambitious and groundbreaking approach to enhancing the sustainability credentials of the beef herd.  The programme had an estimated cost of &euro;300 million.  I reopened it in 2017 to maximise participation and I am more than satisfied that 24,600 farmers have joined.  The expected spend during the lifetime of the programme is &euro;290 million.  Knowledge transfer is a key priority of this rural development programme.  Indicative funding of &euro;100 million was allocated in the RDP to participate in knowledge transfer groups.  As with all such initiatives, it is demand-led.  Based on the current levels of uptake of 19,000 farmers, the expected total spend is &euro;69 million.  The upskilling of these farmers will be a significant achievement, with ongoing and positive implications for both the farmers and the sectors involved.<\/p><p> The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, is a grant-aided scheme which provides much-needed capital investment for farming enterprises.  There has been some concern that the entire allocation of &euro;395 million for TAMS will not be spent, as there were savings in the annual budget in the early years.  However, this trend has reversed and expenditure is now running at an average of over &euro;1 million a week for the past eight months.  There are almost 10,000 existing approvals from my Department for farmers, on which funding has to be drawn down by the approved applicants.  Some of the early approvals have started to expire and the first of the three-year approvals will begin to expire later this year, which means that the budgetary position will become clearer.  The new one-year approval system which was introduced in January 2017 will assist with the accurate assessment of outstanding commitments.  TAMS continues to be open to new applicants, with significant interest shown, and I am working on the assumption that the entire allocation will be fully spent over the lifetime of the scheme.<\/p><p> The allocation under the RDP financial plan under the organic farming scheme is &euro;56 million over the lifetime of the programme.  It aims to achieve a figure of 62,000 ha under organic production.  The scheme has proved to be more popular than first expected and, based on current projections, the total spend under the scheme is expected to be &euro;66 million, with approximately 72,000 ha of land under organic production.  I have also made changes to the rural development programme where need has arisen, including the introduction of new schemes which have also required additional expenditure.  The main example is the sheep welfare scheme where I added an additional &euro;100 million in national funds to the RDP budget, with a view to accommodating all sheep farmers, should they wish to join.  Based on the current uptake of 20,000 applicants with 2 million ewes, the total projected spend is &euro;80 million, which represents a substantial investment and commitment to the sheep sector.  I have also provided an extra &euro;25 million for areas of natural constraint, ANC, farmers this year, again from national resources.<\/p><p> Another programme which has attracted intense interest is the hen harrier programme which seeks to save one of the Ireland&rsquo;s most endangered birds.  Both it and the freshwater pearl mussel scheme which aims to protect the critically endangered freshwater pearl mussel are two designated European innovation partnership, EIP, projects.  A budget of &euro;35 million was originally indicated for both the hen harrier programme and the freshwater pearl mussel project, with an anticipated allocation of &euro;25 million for the hen harrier programme and &euro;10 million for the freshwater pearl mussel scheme.  That is what we expect to spend.  Two impressive project teams are in place and I look forward with interest to the results of these collaborative efforts across the advisory, research and farming communities.<\/p><p> As members are aware, the rural development programme also provides funding for the Leader programme, to the amount of &euro;250 million.  The Leader programme is implemented by the Department of Rural and Community Development under the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, and it is my understanding it expects the full allocation to be spent over the duration of the programme.  <\/p><p> This has been a brief overview of RDP spending.  As members are well aware, there is a perception that spare funds are available to open new measures under the programme.  As this review shows, nothing could be further from the truth.  Our commitments, as outlined, are already such that they will require an allocation under the next programme.  I am keeping the matters under ongoing review to ensure the entire budget will be used and that RDP objectives will be met.  I thank committee members for their attention and look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#N00200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We should not have to be here today.  <\/p><p>As the Minister will recall, in March we had a debate in the D&aacute;il during Private Members business to discuss the provision of support for the suckler cow sector.  We also put forward a motion to require the Minister to carry out a review of the rural development programme to establish what the spending was and, in particular, what level of underspending there might be.  Terms of reference were given to the Minister which we sought to have included as part of the review.  The motion was passed by a strong majority in the D&aacute;il.  It required the Minister to come back within two months with the findings of a review of the rural development programme and outlined the terms of reference for such a review.  The Minister failed to conduct such a review, come back within two months and comply with the terms of reference outlined in the motion, as passed.  We were then left with little choice.  I asked the committee to require the Minister to attend to assess where we were with the rural development programme and, once and for all, address the issues the motion required him to address but which he had ignored and failed to do.  In some ways, I am not surprised because he has been ducking and diving on the issue of the rural development programme.  I refer to how the Government has or, as I put it to the Minister in many cases, has not been following up on the commitments and promises made by him and his predecessor as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p><p>We can see it when we look at GLAS.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, on the opening of the scheme on 23 February 2015, announced in his press release - it was backed up in all subsequent comments - how a total of &euro;1.4 billion had been allocated over the lifetime of the programme.  It allowed for a standard package of up to &euro;5,000 for eligible farmers.  In the additional notes at the end of the press release, for editors and those assessing what it was he was promising, the then Minister also indicated how the &euro;1.4 billion had been allocated for GLAS over the lifetime of the programme to 2020.  It was very specific.  If we look across the agricultural media at the time, whether it was <i>The Farmers Journal <\/i>, the headline on Agriland, <i>The Farming Independent <\/i>or the response from the various farming organisations, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, or Macra na Feirme, they all welcomed the &euro;1.4 billion the Government was committing to GLAS to be spent up to 2020.  The reality has been entirely different.  What is clear at this stage is that by 2022, when all current participants in GLAS have worked their way through and completed their five years, less than &euro;1 billion will have been spent.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, is here to tell and enlighten us that, in fact, of the &euro;1.4 billion, on which the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, was so crystal clear was specifically for the programme up to 2020, which farmers and their representatives accepted in good faith, &euro;400 million was for the REPS and the AEOS.  That is what he is telling us in 2018, three and a half years into GLAS.<\/p><p>At no stage did he, the Government or any official in the Department, acting on his behalf, seek to correct the record whenever the agri-media and farming organisations welcomed the fact that the Government had committed to a &euro;1.4 billion spend on GLAS.  The Minister has tried to duck and dive on the issue since he was appointed.  He has tried to ignore the fact that this promise and commitment were made and that this was the basis on which farmers were operating and what they were expecting.  It is now clear that the allocation will be &euro;1 billion.  The bad faith shown by the Government in what it promised farmers and the fact that the Minister was bluffing them are  being exposed.  He was getting headlines at the time and made a promise on which he had no intention of delivering.  He has tried to stick to that fallacy up until now.  He has tried to sideline it by asking what are we talking about and stating the allocation was only ever going to be &euro;1 billion and that &euro;400 million was for the REPS and the AEOS.  That was not said at the time, nor has it been said since then.  It is unacceptable that the Government would treat farmers in that way.  <\/p><p> When the beef data and genomics programme was published by the previous Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, it was promised that it would facilitate 35,000 farmers and that the spend would be up to &euro;300 million.  It was expected that 35,000 farmers would benefit from it.  Some 24,500 farmers have signed up to the programme and the Minister declared in his opening statement that he was very satisfied that they had taken it up.  It compares to a figure of 50,000 farmers who availed of the previous suckler cow welfare scheme.  The previous Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, committed to a figure of 35,000 farmers, or 11,000 more than the number who have signed up to the programme.  How on earth did the Minister get his figures so wrong for the level of spending under the beef data and genomics programme and the number of farmers who could be accommodated?  Was it that once again he was trying to seek a few headlines to hide his embarrassment about the way in which the Government was failing to cater for the many suckler cow farmers who had previously availed of the suckler cow welfare scheme?  Only half of those who availed of the suckler cow welfare scheme are availing of the beef data and genomics programme.  <\/p><p> The Minister has indicated that there can be a carry-over of costs from the end of 2020 into the next rural development programme.  He has indicated that it could be in of the order of &euro;105 million.  Specifically, bearing it mind that it was introduced in three tranches, how many GLAS participants will still be in the scheme post the end of 2020?  How much will be carried over into the next rural development programme?  I did not see a reference to this in the Minister's opening statement.  The bottom line is that the Minister is telling us that the allocation of &euro;4 billion outlined as part of the 2014 to 2020 rural development programme will be fully spent and that there will be no spare money available.  He has indicated that there will be an underspend in certain areas but not in others.  His bottom line is that there will be no spare money to be taken from the allocation.  That exposes the fibs farmers were told about what they could expect under the individual schemes published by the Minister, particularly GLAS and the beef data and genomics programme.  They have been let down in terms of what they had been led to expect.  The Government has not delivered for them.  They are out of pocket in a way they had not expected and the schemes have not delivered the income the Minister promised they would deliver.  Unfortunately, that is the bottom line and the reality with which we have to deal.  Having tried to avoid this scenario and the fact that he did not come back to us on the motion passed in the D&aacute;il, this is the reality we face.  I would like an explanation from him as to why the Government took that approach and why he tried to bluff farmers on what he was going to deliver for them.  They have been let down by him and the Government.<\/p><p> I would also like the Minister to indicate how he envisages the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, unfolding.  There is a significant underspend.  Obviously, it will be weighted towards the final years of the rural development programme.  There was not much detail in the Minister's presentation on how he envisaged it working its way out.  How can he be so sure at this time that the TAMS element of the rural development programme will be drawn down in full?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#O00300","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation on the rural development programme.  I will not go over the ground covered by Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  It is clear that the Minister has an allocation of &euro;4 billion that was envisaged to be spent between 2014 and 2020.  Doing the sums, I calculate that &euro;3.32 billion will be spent.  The sums are accurate and when we consider the individual schemes, there will be a shortfall.  The amount is significantly less than the &euro;4 billion that was headlined when the programme was announced.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on a few schemes, beginning with the sheep welfare scheme.  In the previous session we met officials from Meat Industry Ireland and the Department to discuss the issue of sheep tagging.  Under the rural development programme a sum of &euro;100 million was allocated for the sheep welfare scheme.  The Minister indicated in his presentation that it was envisaged only &euro;80 million of that allocation would be spent.  There is, therefore, ample headroom to pay for the tags for sheep farmers up to 2020.  The point was made strongly in the previous session that the primary producer was being asked to carry all of the costs of the traceability schemes.  They have been told that there will be added benefits for them in the future.  The Minister has the opportunity to do something practical for sheep farmers by carrying the cost of the tagging regime up to 2020, after which we could sit down and argue about it again.   We cannot say that traceability is bad.  I hope it will bring benefits to the sheep sector, but I put that in brackets.  All of the costs are being carried by the primary producer.  As I said, there is definitely ample headroom under the programme for the Minister to carry the cost of the tagging regime up to 2020.  That initiative would be most welcome for the sheep sector and it could be done without great difficulty.  <\/p> <p>  Up to now no money has been spent under the hen harrier scheme.  We have been told that the first payments will issue in 2019.  In my time in politics I have never seen the value of an asset being taken away in the way it has in the designation of this land.  While it is welcome that a scheme has been put in place, we are extremely critical that no money has been paid to date.  There are farmers in my constituency who still have not been accepted into the scheme which will be judged on whether it restores the capital value of the land.  Unfortunately, it will not do so.  While it is welcome, additional funding for it must be put in place to restore the capital value that has been taken from farmers.  This issue will not go away.  In my time in politics I am not aware of any other decision taken that completely removed the capital value of land from farmers.  Such land with the potential to engage in forestry was worth &euro;4,000 to &euro;4,500 an acre.<\/p><p>Owing to the blanket ban on forestry on hen harrier designated land, that land is now virtually worthless.  I hope the scheme will bring some recompense, but it is a long way short of restoring the capital value of the land.  Farmers are entitled to have its capital value restored and the only way that can be done is through a properly funded scheme, but the &euro;25 million committed in the 2014-20 window will go nowhere near compensating the farmers involved.  There is a significant amount of land involved, some of which is in the Minister's constituency.  The farmers involved have been seriously discriminated against.  The scheme has been promised for a long time.  I hope some money will be spent in 2019, but it is not nearly adequate to restore the capital value of the land.  That is how the scheme will be measured.  If the capital value of the land is restored, we will know that the scheme has been a success; if not, it will have failed to honour the commitments made.  I do not see how it will restore the capital value of farmers' assets.  <\/p><p> There has to be a speedier way for farmers who have essential work to carry out, whether silage slabs or whatever else, to have their applications processed.  We were told that applications would be dealt with speedily, but that is not happening.  I know several farmers who urgently needed to get a silage slab down in May after the bad spring and found it impossible to have their applications processed in time to do the work before the first cut silage.  The system needs to be improved.<\/p><p> For two years I have had a problem with the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  Traditionally, farmers purchased equipment through the co-operatives, but they have been deemed to have broken the rules of eligibility for TAMS.  That issue has not been sorted out and there are several individuals who are seriously out of pocket because of it.  There is no hint of any indiscretion on their part; the co-op did what it always should do and help its supplier members.  It never had any problem qualifying for grant aid in the past, but the farmers concerned still have several outstanding issues.  The co-op would have financed the purchase of the milk tank for them and they would have repaid the cost over several years through their milk cheques.  This system worked well in the past, but, for whatever reason, this time under the criteria they have deemed to be ineligible for the scheme.  That issue has not been resolved.  I have raised it on numerous occasions with officials and farmers are getting extremely annoyed.  They believe they are being victimised again by the small print.  I urge the Minister to resolve the issue once and for all because the farmers concerned should have received grant aid for the purchase of milk tanks.  A few spoke, too, about running into trouble with the hire purchase of machinery.  In my constituency milk tanks are the primary issue.  If farmers are involved in lease arrangements for machinery, they should be catered for too.  That issue needs to be ironed out.  <\/p><p> My colleague has highlighted the underspend with reference to what was advertised at the launch of the scheme.  There can be modifications made to the three schemes.  There is scope under the sheep welfare scheme to cater for the tagging problem.  The hen harrier issue will not go away.  The landowners in the areas affected need payments immediately and a scheme that will restore the capital value of their land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#P00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentation which contains many summary statistics which can hide individual difficulties.  The departmental officials spoke first about the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, because it is the one most farmers have had issues and problems with.  The Department has acknowledged that there have been difficulties in the past few months and payments to farmers have been slow.  Granted, they are in a minority, but they are individual families who have bills to meet and payments to make and find it difficult when they cannot receive their payments.  Some farmers have still not received their GLAS payments and are being told that it is not their fault, that the fault is on the side of the Department and that the issue has not been ironed out because there are various problems with information technology, IT, systems or whatever else.  We hear this all of the time and farmers keep coming back to us.  I have heard the Department tell them that and they are not making it up.  It is the reality and I am not sure how it can be dealt with.  Perhaps there are too many delivery models of IT systems, not one overall system.  I do not know what the problem is, but it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  It was envisaged that 50,000 farmers would receive a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 per farmer under GLAS, but that has not been the outcome.  The big issue in politics is setting out one's intentions and trying to get the outcome to match it.  We acknowledge that it is not always easy to do that, but at the same time we are left with a certain underspend under GLAS because farmers will not receive the amount of money they expected to receive.  I acknowledge that there is an overlap with the rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  There are approximately 2,000 farmers still in the AEOS which will run out very soon and for a time they will be in no scheme.  Can these programmes be extended for the short period until a new environmental scheme is put in place?  They have finished the AEOS, cannot enter the REPS or GLAS and are stuck.  <\/p> <p>  There have been problems with the beef data genomics scheme, but there are fewer farmers engaged in it than anticipated.  When that happens, we expect a certain amount of money not to be spent.  One of the questions asked in the document supplied to us by the Department is whether money can be reallocated between schemes and the answer is yes.  It takes thinking, but it can be reallocated.  It needs to be because there are farmers who are under pressure under many of the schemes.  There will be money left over, as Deputy Charlie McConalogue and others said, and we need to find a way to deal with the matter.  <\/p> <p>  The suckler cow sector, about which we are talking, is the one under most pressure.  The Minister will acknowledge that the recent report from Teagasc on farm incomes showed that they were going up, but it was all in the dairy sector.  Suckler cow and sheep farmers continue to be under the most pressure and are the ones who depend most on the schemes.  The beef data genomics scheme would benefit greatly from being married to some element of a suckler cow scheme to ensure we could do something to enhance quality.  The beef data genomics scheme aims to enhance the quality of calves through breeding, but that can also be done through husbandry.  <\/p> <p>  It was said a certain amount of money would be spent under the sheep welfare scheme, but the amount will fall short by approximately &euro;20 million.  We heard two presentations on tagging which is the way forward and has to happen.  Everyone understands this and the majority of sheep farmers are happy enough with it.  They are under so much financial pressure that it is another cost, unless they can see some way to be compensated or assisted in meeting it.  The Department has stated it will give &euro;50 per farmer for the first year of the scheme.  If it could be added to the sheep welfare scheme, the farmer could receive a little more.  It would help to give farmers security.  The suckler cow and sheep sectors need a statement from the Department and the Government that they believe in and want to support them.  There is an opportunity there to do so.<\/p><p> The Leader programme was mentioned at the very end of the presentation.  Some &euro;250 million goes through that programme.  I have had this out with the Minister, Deputy Ring.  I believe a tiny proportion of that funding has been spent to date.  To be frank, these low numbers arise from the reorganisation.  It was brought to county councils and every bottle washer that could be found in the country was given a job that had something to do with the Leader programme.  It ended up meaning nobody can get money from it.  There are community projects all over the country that are frustrated in this regard.  It is time to go back and look at this again.  The old model delivered very well for communities around the country.  People could find individual cases with problems but they were very much in the minority compared with the excellent job done.  We can compare the way Leader funding was delivered to communities and the way they benefitted from that with the current state of the programme, which is a complete mess.  I appeal to the Minister to speak to the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, about this and go back to the drawing board.  They should work out a scheme to ensure the next round of funding from Leader is not delivered in the same absolutely stupid way.<\/p><p> We can have all the lovely ideas in the world but if they do not work, somebody must stand up and say so.  Leader does not work.  I travel around the country to speak to people in various county development companies and they say it is not working for them.  There are too many rules and regulations and too many people have to look over everything.  It ends with nobody getting any money from a programme that is simply not working.  That should be acknowledged.  We are not interested in beating up or blaming anybody but finding a solution.  The Leader programme has brought many benefits to communities in the past but the current programme has brought only frustration.  That should be acknowledged and we must ensure it works in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#Q00200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies McConalogue, Cahill and Martin Kenny for their questions.

It must be an uncomfortable truth for Deputy McConalogue that the D&aacute;il motion was predicated on support for the suckler sector coming from an alleged underspend in the rural development programme.

There is an overspend of at least &euro;105 million and if we include areas of natural constraint, it could be significantly higher, perhaps as high as &euro;227 million.  If the Deputy's support for the suckler sector is predicated on an underspend in the rural development programme, God help the suckler sector because there is no underspend.<\/p> <p>  A number of specific issues were raised.  It is said that the devil can cite scripture for his own purpose and I will play devil's advocate for that reason.  Not for the first time, Deputy McConalogue alluded to a press statement issued by the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, in which he announced the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  If the Deputy has the document in front of him, he will see that the Minister also stated that the scheme had a maximum of &euro;5,000, with a GLAS+ top-up of &euro;2,000.  It was estimated there would initially be 30,000 participants, with an additional 20,000 participants, leaving 50,000 people in the scheme.  That figure has been achieved.  That is clearly the extent of the commitment.  The Deputy seems to be implying that for some reason the rural development programme should not honour the contractual commitments that existed in other agri-environment schemes, including the agri-environment options scheme and the rural environment protection scheme, as the carryover from the previous scheme.  They were very substantial financial carryover obligations, as I mentioned in my opening remarks.  We originally estimated the expenditure would be in the region of &euro;630 million and the outturn is showing a figure of just under &euro;600 million.  The carried over liability is approximately &euro;599 million.  There was no uncertainty whatever in the Minister's statement.  There would be 50,000 participants, with a payment to a maximum of &euro;5,000 and a top-up for those eligible for GLAS+ of &euro;2,000.  If the Deputy quotes from a statement, he might quote from all of them in the interests of accuracy.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a number of other questions, including on the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  We reopened the BDGP and approved all applications.  No one was turned away.  We had greater ambition for the scheme but it is true that there were significant headwinds.  If I recall, the Deputy was not behind the door in encouraging those headwinds against the scheme and some of the farm organisations were equally critical.  They subsequently became champions of the scheme and campaigned to open it again.  The campaign against the detail of the scheme caused confusion about its merits, at the very least.  We would have liked to have had more participants but when the scheme was reopened, the number of applications did not match our ambition.  Currently, there are 24,600 applicants.  It is a good scheme, which will deliver for the beef industry in terms of carbon efficiency, profitability, etc.  We opened it and approved all applications.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked a specific question on GLAS carryover post-2020.  My information is that this would refer primarily to GLAS 3 applicants, of which there are approximately 12,000.  The cost of that carryover post-2020 will be in the region of &euro;50 million.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also raised a question about the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS.  We have a total outstanding commitment of more than &euro;100 million for 10,000 farmers who have current approvals issued but the work has not been completed or the Department has not been notified that a claim is to be submitted.  We moved from a three-year approval process to a process of 12-month approval.  With plant, the approval process is six months in duration.  This gives a better capacity to track who is doing what.  The first of the three-year approvals expires towards the end of this year.  This will give us a better opportunity to profile the demand on the expenditure.  We have just concluded an application round for which interest was substantial.  We recently closed tranche 10 and it is anticipated there will be 20 tranches under TAMS, each lasting three months.  We anticipate significant demand for capital investment of the type envisaged under TAMS and there are various categories, ranging from low-emission slurry spreading to young farmers to tillage.  There is a list of six or seven headings under which approval will be made.  Two further tranches will be opened this year.<\/p> <p>  I take Deputy Cahill's point about delays in approvals.  To be honest, it is difficult to envisage an application being submitted in the current tranche, which has only just closed, asking for approval to put down a slab for first-cut silage.  There is the old Irish saying \"N&iacute; h&eacute; l&aacute; na gaoithe l&aacute; na scolb\", or it is not the windy day you thatch the roof.  There is a period in which an application is processed.<\/p><p>We make every effort to do so but to be applying in the current tranche for slab for first-cut silage is a bit ambitious.  The departmental staff will try to accommodate people in most cases.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill raised the issue of sheep tagging and EID, which is the best available technology in the context of traceability, market access and food safety.  We now have the FSA report.  I have never hidden from saying there is a cost but there is also a labour saving device and it is much more effective for traceability than the current regime.  Transposing 13-digit numbers onto despatch documents is not conducive to accuracy.  We have engaged with a lot of stakeholders around all these issues and I am convinced it is the right thing to do and will deliver for the industry in the shape of market access and other gains.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill also raised the issue of the hen harrier scheme.  I have designated land in my constituency so I understand his concerns.  I am delighted to have reinstated a scheme which was dropped by a previous Administration in 2008 or 2009 at the height of the crash.  I never said it would be the sole vehicle to address the issue raised by Deputy Cahill as there is a blanket ban on afforestation, which is the subject of a long and tortuously slow threat response plan being delivered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I have been in contact with the relevant Minister and there has been engagement with stakeholders recently that might see some potential for afforestation in some areas, and though the details are yet to be spelled out I have always said a combination of both things could deliver a comprehensive response for landowners.  The Deputy also asked about TAMS assistance for milk tanks.  TAMS has always been a form of grant aid for purchase and that is the problem.  I know there is a tradition in the area of co-operative involvement.<\/p><p> Deputy Kenny referred to GLAS and we have engaged at length on GLAS payments.  While there are issues in the Department, the overwhelming majority of cases where payment has not been made are cases where we await the submission of documentation from clients.  There are a few cases that might have come through appeals processes or where there were changes in actions on particular plots and they all require resolution by the Department but the Department is working through payment details.<\/p><p> The Deputy spoke about an underspend but there is, in fact, a substantial anticipated overspend in the rural development programme of &euro;160 million.  People whose membership of the AEOS scheme is expiring had the opportunity to transfer into GLAS but because the rural development funding is overspent there is now no opportunity to reopen the scheme.  There is a hierarchy in terms of qualifying and in terms of the environmental assets which we prioritise and we told people in previous schemes that they could switch over.  With the funding now having been committed, however, we would have to take funding from other areas to reopen GLAS.  Due to the overspend of &euro;105 million and a possible areas of natural constraint, ANC, overspend of &euro;227 million, the latitude is not there now.<\/p><p> I have dealt with the suckler cow scheme.  Our shared objective is to support the beef sector and somebody referred to the recent Teagasc farm incomes data showing two faces to agriculture - one the very successful commercial dairy side, and to a lesser extent tillage, the other the low-income livestock and beef sector.  The challenge for the next rural development programme is to find the optimal way to support that sector and I look forward to engaging with this committee on the post-2020 CAP in this context.  The detail of the new schemes will be worked on in the immediate period ahead.<\/p><p> Deputy Kenny asked about the Leader programme.  I do not want to trespass on other ministerial areas and we effectively act as a postbox in relation to the Leader programme.  The funding comes through the rural development programme but it is spent and organised by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I know from speaking to Leader groups in my own constituency that it has been particularly slow but I suggest it is not so different from previous rural development programmes, which cranked up slowly and then took off.   I understand that about &euro;5 million of the &euro;250 million has already been spent, although I may be wrong.  There was a substantial reorganisation of the Leader groups because, with less funding being available, they wanted to reduce overhead costs and concentrate whatever scarce resources were available on projects at the coalface.  A lot of the reorganisation took longer than people anticipated but it has now been concluded and in my own area I have seen the beginning of projects coming through the pipeline and getting funding.  I suspect that will accelerate in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#R00500","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I recall the last round of Leader funding when the then Minister, Phil Hogan, had to redistribute funding from certain Leader companies that did not spend their money.  There were problems and some money was not being spent.  Some Leader companies even went to the wall, including one of the three in my area.  The money needs to be spent.<\/p> <p>  Earlier, we were dealing with electronic tagging of sheep.<\/p><p>I know the Minister is aware of this, but farmers are not too impressed at being asked to pay for this.  I wanted to make just one point about the equity of this, and I made it when representatives of the meat industry and Department officials came before the committee.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is issuing its audit report, which points to deficiencies in Department inspections of factories and the jobs the factories might do.  One can talk about inspections and paperwork and so on.  The reality is that this move will benefit everyone, but the only people paying the &euro;50 the Minister is talking about, which, wherever that money comes from, is taxpayers' money, is the farmer, ultimately, because it is a flat fee for him or her.  There is therefore a question about the equity of this and fees being piled on farmers again.  While &euro;50 is not the biggest sum in the world, it all adds up.  As I said earlier, we have sheep farmers where I am situated and we have suckler cow farmers, and they all say the next generation is not interested.  This just compounds it and, of course, we all know about the extended winter we had.<\/p><p> I wish to make a few points about the beef data and genomics programme.  As the Minister knows, a few weeks ago, we had the Irish Charolais Cattle Society and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, before the committee.  I think everyone in general agreed with the merits of a more scientific approach to breeding and looking at genetic information that can improve breeding.  That makes sense.  I think there are certain disputes over how the programme is operating, especially on the part of the Irish Charolais Cattle Society.  More to the point, seeing as the ICBF plays a pivotal part in the rolling out of the beef data and genomics programme and a commitment was given at the time that there would be a review of the programme by the Minister of the day after a number of years, I think concerns were raised.  My understanding is that the gist of this was that it is a very good idea but there is not enough genetic data or information at present to make the star ratings mandatory.  One point the ICBF made well is that on its board, which of course existed before this scheme came into being, the cattle breeders have a very small representation and feel they are not getting an input into the way in which that ship is being steered.  The witnesses at that meeting made some good points, bearing in mind that these cattle breeding societies also have an interest in excellence in breeding.  They raised some legitimate questions.<\/p><p> Going back to the sheep again, the Minister is basically saying there are no underspends in any scheme - nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#S00200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>No.  For the sake of accuracy, I am not saying there is no underspend in specific schemes.

He mentioned the option that farmers on AEOS had to move to GLAS, but the reality now under AEOS 3 is that farmers are leaving it and will probably be three years without getting a payment under a scheme or something similar.  There are also new farmers who are not getting any GLAS payments.  Is there a possibility to reopen GLAS in a limited fashion or do something similar with this balancing act the Department is doing?  Again, this would be in the interests of fairness.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps this next issue is very broad.  Freshwater pearl mussels are the bane of my life.  I do not think they are very rare at all.  Every time we go to build a road or bridge in County Mayo we are stopped because of freshwater pearl mussels.  Fifty per cent of our land is designated.  I think wild mushrooms are now rarer than freshwater pearl mussels because the latter are all over the county.  Money is being given for this scheme that is in place, which I presume is co-funded by Europe along with the Government.  Is the trade-off that we stick with these designations and we cannot build bridges or roads?  Is this really what this money is about?  Many people listening in who live in urban areas, when they think of designated land, tend to think it is virgin land or something.  We have a national primary road either side of which is designated.  The road itself is in a designated area, so we cannot move and are being crippled all the time.  Something must be done, and I will keep doing whatever I must do to try to change this along the western seaboard, particularly in County Mayo.  Many of us will have to come together or else rural Ireland is going nowhere.  It does not matter how much money we pump into Leader or this, that and the other; if we cannot get a road or bridge built, where are we going?  What is the situation in respect of the freshwater pearl mussel?  Can the Minister give me a little more information about it?  As I said, they are as common as muck in Mayo.  I was told not so many years ago that fellas used to come over from Scotland and take them out of the river and no one knew what they were.

Most of the issues in his statement have been covered by previous speakers, so I will not go over old ground.  I will ask some specific questions and perhaps get a little bit of an insight as to how this whole system is predicted by the Department, and I say this particularly because the system is very predictable.  No one is standing over anyone with a big stick saying, \"You predicted you would spend X amoung on a scheme and then there were only half the predicted applicants.\"  One cannot hoodwink or force farmers into applying for schemes, so it is only natural that in some cases, possibly all cases, there will be an underspend.  None of us has a crystal ball.  Conditions change.  Farmers with the best intentions might apply for a scheme today and, if their circumstances change, not apply tomorrow.  In the Department's thinking, when it comes to us with these headline figures, how are they arrived at?  What mechanism, if any, or contingency plan is there within the Department if the scheme does not achieve the predicted number of applicants and the Department can see an underspend coming down the line?  What is plan B in such a case?  The money has been set to one side, but one sees six months or a year in advance of the end of a scheme that it has not had the expected uptake and the Department will not reach the figure.  What happens then with the budgeted money for that scheme?<\/p> <p>  I would also like to know how many approved TAMS schemes were not carried out now that some of them would have reached their deadline date to have the work completed.  They were approved.  I do not want the overall number of applicants but the number of applicants who were approved and have now come to their completed deadline and were not taken up on.  I know there are a number of such cases.  I have some experience on the building side of the matter.  This is probably a side issue, but do the Minister and his accountants here from the Department think that the terms and conditions of many of the schemes, TAMS in particular, and the standards required to achieve the grants are over the top?  When the applicants, having applied and been approved, then sit down and start doing their costings, they see they may be better off going and doing the project and forgetting about the bloody TAMS grant altogether.  They see they can probably achieve as much for less output of their own money and forget about the State money they would have got.<\/p> <p>  I have already asked how the Department comes up with the headline figures.  Deputy Cahill has already mentioned the hen harrier scheme.  The Minister is saying &euro;25 million is allocated for the scheme, but if one sits down and does the sums on it, one finds that, if one had 100% take-up from every eligible qualifying stakeholder out there and they all achieved the maximum payment, which is not possible because of the way in which the scheme is set up and the tick-box exercise that must be done, it would come to &euro;17.5 million.<\/p><p>If we had 100% take-up on the maximum payment the figure would come to &euro;17.5 million.  Yet, the headline figure is &euro;25 million.  Can someone explain that to me?  There will be a shortfall in spending on the scheme unless something miraculous happens.  I am no mathematician or genius but I can predict that will happen.  How are the headline figures generated when schemes are being announced with details on what will be spent on them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#T00600","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Senator Mulherin raised the issue about sheep electronic identification tagging and the prospect that there could be an increased payment under the sheep welfare scheme.

I appreciate that the cost is borne by the farmer and I have never hidden from that.  If costs are reduced along the line and that results in diminished costs elsewhere, then there is a likelihood that some of the saving will be passed back to farmers.  This should help as well.  It is not a silver bullet but it should help with market access.  More market access is beneficial.  Let us consider the converse.  If we have fewer markets we become more of a price taker, whereas when we have more market opportunities we are better able to navigate the best opportunities for farmers, if one market goes down.  I firmly believe this is the right thing to do for many reasons.  There is a cost for market access but there are labour saving elements as well.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland report speaks for itself.  I believe it is the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of an evaluation of the beef data genomics programme.  That is under way.  I have no wish to go into too much of the detail but it is a data driven scheme.  The more data and information that is available to farmers about breeding practices in the beef industry, the better.  The same applies to any industry.  This has been proven in the dairy herd.  The more data available to farmers that is gathered from this programme, the better their chances of making proper decisions in their farms.<\/p> <p>  I would encourage the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation.  It is not a Department agency.  In fact, I believe it operates under a co-operative structure.  We do not appoint board members.  However, I believe there is a case to be made for the ICBF to be more engaging and proactive in terms of what I believe is a story that the federation needs to share.  As the federation gathers more and more data, the story will help the industry to make better informed decisions.<\/p> <p>  I have no wish to get caught in the crossfire between breeding societies and the ICBF.  They have different, if not conflicting, objectives.  Good luck to breeding societies.  Farmers should be able to make informed breeding decisions on the basis of data.  That is what beef data genomics programme aims to do.  That data must be legible, decipherable and consumable by farmers.  That is something the ICBF could take on board in getting its message out.<\/p> <p>  I take Senator Mulherin's point about the pearl mussel.  I have seen some of this stuff myself at constituency level as well.  There is a conservation element, as in the hen harrier scheme.  We need to be practical how it impacts with development objectives locally.  It is not especially useful to comment any further on that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly makes a point about how many will apply for the scheme and how we plan for it.  We are into numerous rural development plans at this stage.  We have form in respect of various schemes, including the agri-environment option scheme, GLAS and the rural environment protection scheme.  We have a reasonable handle on the appetite for such schemes.  Therefore, we can make an informed guess on the level of applications.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly mentioned the hen harrier scheme and asked what if everyone applied.  It is never the case that everyone applies.  The criticism I am getting on the hen harrier scheme is that farmers cannot get in fast enough with their applications.  There is a process that the scheme requires farmers to join at various stages.  There is form in terms of estimating the level of interest in any scheme.  We get representations from farm organisations as well and that is helpful.  We hear from all stakeholders on what schemes might be of interest.  All these things go into the mix in constructing the next rural development programme.<\/p> <p>  The policy objectives need to be met as well.  There is farmer interest in schemes.  In the context of the next rural development programme a major challenge will be to align them.  Our requirement will be to align more of our rural development programme and our pillar 1 spending on climate-related projects.  That is clearly a policy direction of travel.  We need to be able to find a way to do that in a way that works for farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#U00800","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The Minister said himself that the Department seldom has 100% take-up.

The Minister indicated that he was confused at my opening comment on why we were at the committee discussing this matter.  The Minister indicated it was his understanding that it was the view or wish of the Business Committee of the D&aacute;il that this should be dealt with at the Joint Oireachtas committee and that the Minister was complying with that desire.<\/p><p>I will clarify the position.  The motion passed by the D&aacute;il required the Minister to carry out a review of the rural development programme within two months and report on the spending commitments made and the participation rates for the schemes, but he did not do so.  When he failed to do so, I wrote to him and the Ceann Comhairle about his failure to comply with the motion.  The Minister responded to me by letter to the effect that he had answered questions about the rural development programme at a previous meeting of the committee and believed that in so doing he had done all that was required of him.  I then wrote again to him and the Ceann Comhairle.  When the Business Committee next discussed the issue, this committee had already written to the Minister asking him to appear before it to account for his failure to follow through on what was requested of him in the motion.  We are here on the basis of his failure to comply with the motion to carry out a review of the rural development programme.<\/p><p> The Minister has indicated that support for the suckler cow sector is predicated on there being an underspend under the rural development programme.  During the debate on the motion Fianna F&aacute;il called for support for the suckler cow sector, which is under massive pressure.  There are parts of the country where engagement in suckler beef and sheep production is the only suitable farm enterprise.  We need to work together to support the farmers involved to continue to make a living.  The motion sought to establish whether there was an underspend under the rural development programme and, if such underspend was identified, to ensure it would be directed towards providing support for the suckler cow sector.  The motion also stated that, regardless of the underspend, the position on which needed to be clarified in the immediate term, we needed to work together in the next CAP negotiations to support the suckler cow sector.  That was Fianna F&aacute;il's position on the matter.  The Minister has since been dismissive of any need for support for the suckler cow sector.  Earlier this year he floated the idea of an early slaughter premium to support the sector, but a couple of months later he said he no longer supported that proposal, such that we are now not certain of his position.  That has been his track record on the matter.<\/p><p> The Minister indicated that Fianna F&aacute;il was of the view that we should not honour a commitment in respect of carryover from a previous rural development programme.  That is not the core of what we have been saying; rather, we have been saying the Minister should honour his commitments in respect of the programme, including the commitment of &euro;1.4 billion for GLAS.  We are saying he should honour no more than his own promises, instead of trying to cloud the position in terms of what was in place previously.  Previously, he committed to providing &euro;1.4 billion for GLAS, but he is now saying that figure included a transitional payment from the REPS and the AEOS.  <\/p><p> On the spend under GLAS, the Minister referenced that the former Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, had indicated in a press release that there would 50,000 participants in the scheme and made the point that in not referencing that there were 50,000 participants I was only giving half the story.  In other words, I was referring to the commitment to provide &euro;1.4 billion but not to the 50,000 participants.  The Minister's point is that because the scheme has been taken up by 50,000 participants the Government has fulfilled its commitments.  I never said there would not be 50,000 participants.  I acknowledge that figure has been achieved.  I was focusing on the commitment given by the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, that there would be &euro;1.4 billion specifically for GLAS within the period of the rural development programme from 2014 to 2020.  The Minister is now saying the &euro;5,000 per participant figure was the maximum payment and that it was never intended that it would be an average sum.  That was not the position of the former Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  His position was that that he expected it to be the average figure.  <\/p><p> I am not the first person to raise this as an issue or fight this battle.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was very much to the fore in highlighting that the Government was not following through on its promises.  At Question Time in the D&aacute;il, when he and the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, were debating whether the Government's funding commitments would be followed through, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked the then Minister whether the average figure of &euro;5,000 would be achieed and whether the full spending commitment would be met.  In response, the then Minister said the maximum payments under GLAS and GLAS+ would be &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000, respectively.  It was always expected that the average payment would be close to the maximum figure of &euro;5,000 because the majority of farmers would be eligible to draw down the full amount.  It should be borne in mind that some would be receiving &euro;7,000 under GLAS+.  The then Minister went on to say that, on the basis of the number of entrants up to that point, he had no doubt that GLAS would succeed in attracting 50,000 applicants over the lifetime of the scheme and that it was projected that expenditure of about &euro;250 million per year would be required when the full 50,000 applicants were participating in the scheme.  That gives an average figure of &euro;5,000.  That is what the former Minister said.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, is now backtracking and saying the sum of &euro;1.4 billion announced by the former Minister for GLAS always included the figure of &euro;400 million and that the Government was always clear on this.  The Minister was never clear on it.  It was always hidden.  In fact, it was made clear that &euro;1.4 billion was being provided for GLAS.  It has now been clarified that that is not what was being delivered and that farmers were sold a fib at the time.  <\/p><p> On the next rural development scheme, can the Minister outline the projected spend on GLAS in 2021 and 2022?  As we already know the number of participants in GLAS and how much they are being paid, the Minister need only make a simple calculation to provide the committee with the projected spend in those years.  He referenced a spend of &euro;4 billion under the current rural development programme.  When one takes from that figure the &euro;600 million for the transitional arrangement under the previous rural development programme, the figure for the 2014-20 rural development programme amounts to only &euro;3.23 billion.  Will the &euro;104 million the Minister referenced as being the overspend be taken from the allocation for the next rural development programme because included in the &euro;104 million is the additional &euro;25 million of national financing for the area of natural constraints scheme.  There is also the additional &euro;100 million of national financing for the sheep welfare scheme.  The Minister sold these increases in funding to farmers as Exchequer payments over and above what was being provided for in the rural development programme, yet he is saying today that the overspend of &euro;104 million under the current programme will be part of a transitional arrangement and clawed back under the next rural development programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061900002#U02200","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529418600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The Deputy is engaged in selective quotation.

The NERI has also found that the average 18 to 24 year old worker earned one tenth less in real terms in 2016 than in 2008 and that the average 25 to 34 year old worker saw a real increase of just 1.4% in this period.<br\/><br\/>The public finances are improving, but they are still marginally in deficit a decade after the start of the crisis.  Congress concurs with the European Commission's assessment set out in its 2018 Ireland country report that addressing infrastructural bottlenecks is essential for sustainable and balanced growth in the future.  Public spending <i>per capita<\/i>in Ireland is just 85% of the weighted average in similar high income western European countries such as France and Germany, as well as the Benelux and Nordic countries.  This amounts to an underspend of &euro;12 billion a year compared with these countries.<br\/><br\/>Repairing public services, overcoming infrastructural shortcomings, addressing the consequences of a growing and ageing population and responding to the impact of new technologies, Brexit and other emerging risks all require a substantial increase in investment in the coming years over and above what is envisaged in the Ireland 2040 strategy.<\/p><p>Repairing public services, overcoming infrastructural shortcomings, addressing the consequences of a growing and ageing population as well as responding to the impact of new technologies, Brexit and other emerging risks require a substantial increase in investment in the coming years.  This increase must be over and above what is envisaged under the Ireland 2040 strategy.  In particular, we need to invest more in social and affordable housing, early years services, education, public health, water, rural broadband, clean energy, public transport and motorways as well as research and development and innovation to ensure sustainable, balanced growth over the longer term.  Given the many challenges facing Ireland, it is our firm view that tax cuts are simply not affordable, would only prevent Ireland from achieving the sound and stable public finances necessary to meet the needs of 21st century Ireland and pose a risk of overheating the economy.<\/p><p> As advocated in the European Commission draft country-specific recommendations, budget 2019 should limit the scope and number of tax expenditures and broaden the tax base.  The reality is that the Government simply does not collect sufficient revenue through general taxation and social insurance to ensure the public services on which people in peer countries can rely.  This is mainly due to the lower employer social security contributions levied here than in those countries.<\/p><p> ICTU is proposing a number of measures to raise additional revenue next year.  In particular, it is time to end the \"temporary\" reduction in VAT for hospitality introduced seven years ago.  This alone could raise over &euro;500 million, which would be enough to build 2,500 homes or dramatically increase investment in early years services.  The congress pre-budget submission for 2019 will set out our priorities to ensure that workers and their families receive a fairer share of the economic growth taking place - it is forecast to continue over the short term, at least - and ensure that people who suffered more than most during the crisis are supported to live a life of dignity.<\/p><p> Budget 2019 should seek to improve the social wage.  This is comprised of the non-wage returns to workers in the form of decent early years care and education, health, education, transport and housing services.  It should improve the provision of high quality childcare, as advocated in the European Commission draft country-specific recommendations.  Government childcare policies must address the problem of poor pay and conditions for workers in the sector.  Policies must ensure that adequately qualified workers are attracted to and remain in this key sector.<\/p><p> Hundreds of thousands of people are affected by the housing crisis, as highlighted in the ICTU housing survey issued last week.  Budget 2019 should prioritise the increased supply of social and affordable homes, the improvement of services and measures aimed at supporting homeless people, the use of vacant homes and sites and swifter progress towards a cost rental system.  Congress is specifically calling for a local government-led social housing programme involving the construction of at least 10,000 units per annum.<\/p><p> Budget 2019 should aim to make progress towards a well-funded, universally accessible, single tier health service, as outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, especially with regard to the expansion of primary and community care services.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute has found that public investment on a per student basis in education is low compared with peer countries, especially in primary and lower secondary education.  Public investment in education would have to increase by nearly &euro;2 billion to reach the peer country average.  Budget 2019 should prioritise investment in the DEIS programme, further reducing early school leaving rates and the number of young people not in employment, education or training - this figure was 13% of young people in 2016 - as well as in lifelong learning and basic digital skills.  Social welfare payments should be increased by at least a higher percentage than forecast inflation next year.  In addition, the most regressive cuts imposed during the crisis years should be reversed, especially those affecting young people, lone parents and older people.<\/p><p> The living wage, currently cited as &euro;11.70 per hour, is the minimum that all workers should receive.  The minimum wage, however, is four fifths of this amount.  Moreover, &euro;400 million will be spent this year supporting low-paid workers with children through the working family payment, formerly the family income support, and &euro;300 million on the housing assistance payment.  These and similar payments represent the subsidising in many cases of low-paying employers.  The national minimum wage should be brought into line with the living wage.<\/p><p> Brexit poses a considerable threat to the jobs of thousands of workers, especially those in agrifood and traditional manufacturing.  These workers are mostly based in rural areas.  We are proposing the introduction of a specific measure, a Brexit adjustment assistance fund, aimed at supporting these workers now rather than in a few years when they might lose their jobs.  This should be built on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has helped 11,000 workers in the Republic over the past decade, as well as the US trade adjustment assistance programme, which is similar to the European globalisation fund but with a stronger emphasis on income support.<\/p><p> ICTU wants to see Ireland embark on a path that sees at least 0.7% of output devoted to official overseas development aid by 2025, a target that is already exceeded by a number of peer countries.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King for her opening statement.

When we issued our pre-budget submission to the Oireachtas in May we asked members to cast their minds back to the summer of 2008.  Back then, new house prices were only &euro;18,000 off their 2007 peak but they were not plummeting.  The soft landing was on its way and the dismal scientists had got it wrong.  Shortly afterwards, things started to happen in America and we had a 31% fall in new and second-hand house prices.  The rest is history.  Back then, we had national debt of only &euro;50 billion.  We were able to borrow our way out of the hole then.  Today, our debt is more than four times higher, excluding our pension debt.  We will not be able to borrow our way out of the next crisis.<\/p> <p>  In our pre-budget submission we pointed out the many macroeconomic risks to Ireland.  There are arguably more internal and external risks to the health of the State now than there were in the run-up to the 2008 recession.  Unfortunately, in the current political environment we see little appetite to acknowledge and confront these risks.<\/p> <p>  Our country and its citizens are too heavily in debt.  At the same time, Ireland has suffered a decade of underinvestment, which is being felt in the state of housing, health, education and childcare.  Yet, the clamour for spending is all weighted to the current side.  Despite a persistent gap of 40% between the wage bill of public and private sector workers, the majority of our so-called fiscal space is being diverted into the public payroll.  This impacts our public competitiveness, which has disimproved from sixth to 12th place according to the recent IMD World Competitiveness Center measure.  Our pre-budget submission called for this gap to be closed to 10% by 2025.  The public-private sector pay gap is not to be found in any other advanced economy in northern Europe.  If Ireland is to thrive, there must be a rebalancing of our spending priorities and the way we address the cost of living and cost of business issues.<\/p> <p>  We are entering an era of unprecedented volatility in international trade and our relationship with our nearest neighbour, yet everything we are doing domestically is reducing our ability to compete internationally.  Despite investing in the creation of the National Competitiveness Council, we ignore its findings, as if allowing the council to simply write reports is an adequate outcome.  Ireland is a high wage economy, the fourth highest in Europe in employer-borne wage costs.  The issue is not our domestic wage levels but rather the cost of living for Irish workers.  Ireland is consistently the fourth most costly European economy to live in.  The spending of our citizens is 23% above the EU average on a like-for-like basis, but there is little appetite to understand the reasons.  The cost of accommodation for our workers is now a material deterrent to those workers living in Dublin.  It is nonsense to think that this cost of accommodation issue can be bridged by employers paying more.  That money will simply pass from employers to the owners of accommodation via their employees.<\/p> <p>  Our electricity prices are the fourth most expensive in Europe.  Yet, our regulator is considering further increasing the public service obligation levy, a charge which makes it more difficult for businesses to invest in low-carbon technology.  We are the second worst performing country in Europe in greenhouse gas reduction.  Our insurance costs remain farcically high because we refuse to tackle known issues with our legal system, Central Bank insurance data, insurers, the book of quantum and our Judiciary.  Other countries tackled these problems decades ago.  We simply pass the costs to business, charities, sports clubs and citizens in ever higher insurance costs and health costs.  This rent-seeking behaviour by the legal profession is not merely immoral; it is having a detrimental effect on the health of our children, for example, through no-running policies in schools, and on our social and civic fabric of life.  Most of the remedies to these issues are legislative.<\/p><p> We remain dangerously overdependent on a small number of pillar banks, whose only priority is balance sheet repair.  Meanwhile, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, if they can access working capital, are paying significantly more to access it than their competitors in other countries.<\/p><p> We agree with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, that Ireland has the highest rate of people who are not in education, employment or training, known as NEETs, in Europe, yet all our focus is on our underfunded university sector.  We need fewer, better universities and a far greater spend on skills, technological training, vocational training and lifelong learning.<\/p><p> We regret to observe that successive budgets have prioritised multinational corporations rather than indigenous SMEs.  This is despite the fact that SMEs employ 950,000 people, almost three times as many as the multinational sector.  Our businesses are local, native, and ubiquitous, but since the Culliton and Telesis reports we have had no independent strategic review of our industrial policy.  Indigenous enterprise will not be tempted to move out of Ireland by changes in US corporation tax rates.  We ask the committee to bear that in mind as it considers budget 2019.  Measures introduced previously, such as the employment and investment incentive scheme, the knowledge development box, and the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, are so complex that small business cannot use them.  <\/p><p> Our pre-budget submission for 2019 asks the committee to \"think SME\".  In view of the political and economic threats that are present today, we believe it is extremely important that it does so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Committee on Budgetary Oversight for the invitation to discuss priorities for budget 2019.  Dublin Chamber values its ongoing engagement with parliamentarians of all parties and is appreciative of this opportunity to present its preliminary recommendations for budget 2019.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Chamber is the largest chamber of commerce in Ireland.  We represent more than 1,300 firms throughout the greater Dublin area, employing some 300,000 people nationally.  The firms range in size from small start-ups to major multinationals.  Our diverse and cross-sectoral membership base gives the chamber a keen insight into the needs of both businesses and their employees in the run-up to the budget.  <\/p> <p>  The chamber takes a holistic view of the commercial environment.  In our policy agenda, we strive to reflect the complementary needs of business and society.  Many of the members of the committee will be familiar with our Dublin 2050 initiative from a number of years ago.  Last year, we ran the great Dublin survey.  It had more than 1 million impressions on social media and received more than 20,000 responses from residents of the capital to discern their hopes, needs, dreams and aspirations for the future.  From that survey we devised a vision for the future of Dublin as a city that will be globally renowned for its economic vitality and quality of life.  It is with this vision in mind that we approach budget 2019.  <\/p> <p>  Our budget recommendations have been approved by our elected policy council and shaped by ongoing engagement with our membership base and the work of our budget and taxation task force, led by Mr. Vincent Harrison.  While official estimates of available Exchequer resources next year have not been available for long, we hope to inform the work of this committee by outlining our strategic priorities and preliminary recommendations.  The context of the budget shows that Ireland's small open economy has continued to perform strongly despite rising international risks.  Robust economic growth is continuing, and there is healthy consumer sentiment.  Meanwhile, the labour force is steadily approaching full employment.  Dublin Chamber research suggests that more than half of firms expect staff numbers to rise in the third quarter of 2018.  Such figures offer reason for optimism, but we also caution against an overly expansionary fiscal policy.  Headline indicators are positive, but the underlying position is precarious.  Internal risk factors include high Government debt, the inadequacy of economic infrastructure, the productivity gap between Irish and multinational firms, and reliance on a narrow segment of tax receipts.  These weaknesses leave Ireland's globalised economy highly vulnerable to external shocks.  Budget 2019 must take action to address these weaknesses, while avoiding inflation.  Dublin Chamber notes the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, observation that there are already signs of overheating in the economy, and echoes recent International Monetary Fund, IMF, advice that Ireland should exercise caution with its fiscal policy in 2019.  <\/p> <p>  Informed by these realities and business feedback, Dublin Chamber recommends that the fiscal space should be used to prepare Dublin and Ireland for the challenges ahead, by strengthening the fundamentals of the economy, namely, our infrastructure, indigenous businesses and labour force.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>As Ms Mary Rose Burke outlined, Dublin Chamber advocates a targeted approach to the use of available resources in 2019.  I will discuss these under three headings, each of which represents an imperative for government, namely, investment in Ireland's infrastructure, growing Ireland's businesses and investment in Ireland's human capital.<br\/><br\/>The inadequacy of our infrastructure stock is perceived as the most important barrier to doing business in Ireland, according the World Economic Forum survey.  Infrastructure ranks as the most important policy issue for businesses in the greater Dublin area and is identified as the greatest challenge facing competitiveness of the region.  In a survey of Chamber members carried out this quarter, almost half - some 48% - chose investment in infrastructure as the top priority for budget 2019.  Dublin Chamber welcomes Project Ireland 2040<i><\/i>and the accompanying national development plan, NDP.  Alignment of spatial and capital investment planning is to be commended, as is the longer-term approach adopted in the NDP.  The first test of budget 2019 will be whether it meets the Government's commitments as outlined in the NDP.  This will require &euro;7.3 billion in Exchequer funding for public capital expenditure.  While the Chamber is heartened by the NDP, stable and timely implementation will be crucial.  The recent pattern of capital expenditure in Ireland is among the most unstable in western Europe, and it must avoid slipping back into this traditional pattern of boom and bust.  Given the importance of infrastructure delivery, the rainy day fund should be used as an insurance policy for the NDP.  Dublin Chamber recommends that when economic growth dips below the level required to fund delivery of the NDP, drawdown from the rainy day fund should be permitted to ensure steady implementation.<br\/><br\/>The success of Dublin is critical to the success of Ireland.  However, contrary to widespread perception, the capital city is significantly underfunded relative to other regions.  For example, Dublin received the second lowest level of capital investment per head from central Government of any county from 2009 to 2016.  According to a survey conducted earlier this year, more than two thirds - some 68% - of firms in Dublin believe that not enough is being done to improve infrastructure in the city.  Traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area already costs the economy &euro;350 million per annum.  This figure will rise to a cost of &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033.  In this context, projects to relieve the growing pressure in the capital must be prioritised for delivery.  Chief among these are MetroLink, the DART expansion programme, BusConnects, and the Shannon water pipeline project. <br\/><br\/>To secure its future prosperity, Ireland must remain attractive to multinational investors while also taking action to avoid excessive reliance upon a narrow number of multinational businesses.  This will require the strengthening of the indigenous business base.  There is little sense among businesses that progress is being made in this area.  A recent Department of Finance and OECD study highlighted the widening productivity gap in the economy, with productivity being increasingly driven by foreign dominated sectors such as ICT, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications.  <br\/><br\/>Budget 2019 will be the last budget before Brexit.  To provide a competitive context for our proposals on entrepreneurship, Dublin Chamber has undertaken a comparison of the island of Ireland and the UK.  The table displayed on the slide is included in our preliminary recommendations document and I invite the committee to consider it.  While progress on all these fronts is not feasible in any one fiscal year, there is room for Ireland to make a serious statement of intent in 2019.  First, Ireland's offering to entrepreneurs is starkly uncompetitive when compared with the UK offering, which includes a lifetime cap of &pound;10 million on qualifying gains for entrepreneur relief from capital gains tax.  This is worth approximately &euro;11.4 million in current market prices.  This compares with a &euro;1 million cap in Ireland.  To send a strong signal that Ireland intends to compete with the UK ahead of Brexit, Dublin Chamber recommends upgrading entrepreneur relief to surpass the relief available in the UK.  The cost of bringing the lifetime limit applicable here up to the nominal UK equivalent of &euro;10 million, as promised in the programme for Government, has been estimated at &euro;54 million, using the non-dynamic costing model employed by the Department of Finance.  A further increase in the limit to &euro;15 million would incur an added annual cost to the Exchequer of just &euro;2 million, according to the same model, while positioning Ireland at a clear competitive advantage against the UK.<br\/><br\/>Second, Dublin Chamber proposes a scheme to encourage greater investment in existing Irish SMEs.<\/p><p>As a matter of principle, the capital gains tax rate should reflect the risk profile of the investment concerned and its contribution to the Irish economy.  In practice, however, the flat 33% rate of CGT effectively incentivises passive investors to invest in large blue chip multinationals at the expense of investment in higher-risk Irish start-ups and SMEs.<\/p><p> Dublin Chamber recommends introducing an investor relief along the lines of the UK model, offering a lower CGT rate of 20% on all investment in unquoted companies to encourage the growth of indigenous businesses. <\/p><p> Dublin Chamber calls on the Government to consider a lower rate of income tax on dividends for entrepreneurs in order to reward entrepreneurship at all stages in the business life cycle.  To develop prospering indigenous businesses on a large scale, Ireland must offer rewards to entrepreneurs for staying on to scale their businesses rather than offering divestment as the only path to extract large-scale value. <\/p><p> Consideration should also be given to making the research and development tax credit more attractive to SMEs by allowing an up-front claim and increasing the credit rate to 30%.  This would begin to address the low levels of innovation in the indigenous sector.  <\/p><p> With regard to investing in Ireland's human capital, Dublin Chamber recommends that the Government takes measures to attract, retain and develop talent in the Irish labour force.  This is crucial to check rising costs, maintain Irish attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment and support indigenous business growth.<\/p><p> Access to skilled labour is a rapidly growing challenge facing businesses in the greater Dublin area.  Almost two thirds of chamber members now report that they are searching for employees with a particular skill set but struggling to find them.<\/p><p> This challenge will continue to mount in the context of a buoyant labour market.  As the OECD has recently noted, Irish labour costs threaten to slow business growth and undermine competitiveness through inflation, making it difficult for SMEs to compete with larger firms for skilled employees.  While inward migration will continue to play a valuable role, population growth in the capital carries its own challenges in terms of managing overstretched infrastructure and the housing stock.<\/p><p> The female employment rate in Ireland is 10.4% lower than the male rate.  This represents untapped potential in the Irish labour force that can be utilised without increasing demographic pressure.  One in five Dublin Chamber members has specifically identified easing female labour market participation to help them access the skill sets that they require.<\/p><p> There is clear evidence that the gap in female labour participation is due to the burden of child-rearing falling upon women in a context of high childcare costs.  Female labour force participation diverges sharply from male participation around childbearing age and fails to catch up before retirement. <\/p><p> This is increasingly supported by business feedback.  Over three quarters of Dublin Chamber members now report that the cost of childcare has a material impact on their business.  Noting recent IMF advice, Dublin Chamber recommends a significant expansion of fiscal support for the new single affordable childcare scheme to ameliorate the problem in 2019.<\/p><p> Dublin Chamber has a number of other recommendations to improve the skills base in Dublin and help SMEs to attract the skilled specialists they need to grow.  These are included in our submission. <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the Deputies for their kind attention and the committee clerk and other committee staff for their assistance.  We are keen to hear the members' feedback on our strategic priorities and recommendations in advance of our final submission to the Department of Finance.  We look forward to discussing them with members in more detail this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Harrison","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harrison very much.

My questions are on the real capital expenditure on infrastructure over the next few years.  The Government is currently beset by ongoing difficulties associated with housing.  While the level of building a private houses has certainly picked up, there is almost no significant progress being made on social housing or, indeed, affordable housing.  In that context, does each group believe it is correct to establish a rainy day fund <i>per se<\/i>when the Government could establish a housing development bank or corporation that would use funds, including projected dividends from NAMA, to fund local authority social and affordable housing?  Money would be repaid to the development bank fund via social housing rent and mortgage repayments on affordable social housing.  Do the various groups believe that simply putting money on deposit in a rainy day fund, which would be placed on deposit around the world, is the best use of a very scarce capital resource at this time when we could follow the example of countries that have found other mechanisms?  We are no longer restrained in the way we were over the past ten years in terms of capital investment as a country.<\/p><p>My second question concerns the summer economic statement, which has just been published, and the amount of &euro;2.6 billion, which has been committed in terms of the &euro;3.4 billion envelope that the Minister for Finance has identified in terms of next year's budget.  Could ICTU, in particular, comment on the plight of people employed by section 39 organisations who in many cases voluntarily took reductions in pay in line with the public sector but who have failed in seeking to restore pay parity?  I do not see any reference in any detail in the summer economic statement to any restoration being committed to specifically by the Government.  Has ICTU or its member unions reached or developed any further understanding with the Government on making this one of the priorities in sorting out issues that arose in 2008 but which have yet to be rectified?<\/p><p>On the health service, have any of the organisations considered how to increase dedicated funding to the HSE and Tusla?  As we know, the Government has pretty much experienced fairly constant crises in different elements of both of those organisations for the past two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#E00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I will make reference to the rainy day fund.  It is raining cats and dogs for thousands of people every day.  I refer to people who find themselves living in hotels and totally unsuitable accommodation.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for any Administration or set of policymakers to convince those people about the taking of a dollop of money.  Every accountant and economist is asking, \"What heresy does this woman speak?\"  I am sure there is merit in putting money aside for the rainy day but we have horrendous social problems that just need to be addressed.  There are many people who get very frustrated over what seem to be anodyne responses to the matter in some cases and, in other cases, over people just not getting it in respect of the daily suffering of those affected.  Therefore, it is very difficult to say one should take this money, lodge it in a rainy day fund and not have any real proposal or prospect for those coming out of the circumstances to which I referred.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister for Finance will take the opportunity to lay out in concrete terms the Government's proposals to deal with this issue.  In 2017, 780 local authority houses were built.  I was born and reared in County Wicklow.  For the last three years, not one social or affordable house has been built in Wicklow despite the lengthy waiting list for housing in the area.  It will be hard to convince people on the housing waiting lists of the need for a rainy day fund.  Approximately 19,600 houses are to come on stream via the private sector and the housing assistance payment scheme and other schemes, much of which accommodation is below par for people on the social housing lists.  We are so far off getting it right, such that the focus should not be on what amount could be put into a rainy day fund.  <\/p><p> The Deputy is correct in what she said about the section 39 organisations.  However, I would not in that regard have necessarily used the word \"voluntary\".  People had no choice.  The Government told the HSE and the Department of Health they had to implement the same levels of cuts on staff wages of these organisations as were applied throughout the public sector.  The HSE and the Department fully fund most of those organisations and so staff therein were subject to the same level of cuts.  However, no provision was made in the Lansdowne Road agreement restoration process to replenish the wages of staff of the section 39 organisations.  Currently, we are in a form of industrial foray with the HSE and the matter has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission.  The industrial action is deferred on the basis that talks are afoot.  I do not know if they will be successful and I would not like to say anything that might impact on the discussions that are ongoing as we speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Would the ISME representatives like to respond on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#F00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>On social housing, I am not expert on this topic but it is clear we have a housing issue in the country.

If we get the data right, we can then make better decisions.  I imagine the purpose of the rainy day fund is to ensure there is a fund of money available for spending when in a counter-cyclical environment spending needs to be made on the public side.  When private sector investment is down the spend is from the capital account and in that instance the Government would possibly use a rainy day fund.  I recognise the requirement for infrastructure investment.  There are other capacity constraints, including in terms of finance, which is a major issue on the private sector side in particular; and in terms of skills.

We can try to fund that through payments back to local authority housing.  We do need to spend money on housing now but we also need to stop spending in the round because we are going to run out of money quite soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Would Ms Burke like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#F00500","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>We believe that the most immediate threat to upward pressure on wage costs in Dublin comes from inflation, the cost of accommodation and the lack of residential capacity in high demand areas.  This is the most egregious example of under-investment in Dublin's infrastructure, including in the housing sector.  We are experiencing a real accommodation crisis, with the highest ever number of households on the social housing waiting lists and the highest number of households reliant on social housing supports such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rent supplement.  Despite that Dublin has the greatest housing need in the country it received the lowest capital investment in housing from central government in the period from 2009 to 2016.  We believe there are a number of issues that need to be considered in addressing the issue.  We need a commitment to density in high demand areas.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce has long been an advocate for the economic, social and environmental benefits of greater urban density.  We also need market stability.  Every time the Government signals to the market that it is looking at changing building regulations there is a drop in activity levels.  We need a period of time to adjust to new regulations, particularly in the apartment sector.  We need to build more social housing.  We believe that social housing provision should shift from the counterproductive policies of private home acquisition and rental support to the construction of purpose built social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2018 committed to the provision of almost 6,000 new social housing units next year but that is an increase of only 31 on the number committed to last year.  At the same time, more money is being put into the housing assistance programme.  We believe this is exacerbating the problem and that this money would be better spent in the direct build of new social housing.  We also need to look at initiatives to better manage vacant homes.  On the rainy day fund, we believe it should be available to smooth out the stop and start in capital investment, including in the build of social housing.  We need a sustained programme of capital investment and the rainy day fund should be available to maintain the base level of construction that is needed in housing and other infrastructure and to prevent the stop-go type of investment that we have seen in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their responses.

My first question is to Ms King.  She mentioned a Brexit adjustment assistance fund.  Perhaps she would elaborate on what is proposed in that regard.  On the 9% VAT rate, which Ms King advocated be returned to its previous level, the argument from industry is that that would cost jobs.  In my own constituency of Mayo there are many hospitality workers and I would be concerned about the impact of an increased VAT rate on businesses in the area versus the Dublin sector.  In addition, in light of Brexit, there is concern that there will be a reduction in the number of tourists from the UK. <\/p> <p>  Ms King also listed a number of priorities and areas that she feels need to be addressed.  There is nothing in her statement with which I disagree.  Ms King mentioned the need for investment in health, housing, early years education, broadband and so on.  What are her two priorities for budget 2019?  I take it housing would be one of those priorities.  I am particularly interested in investment in the early years education sector and the impact that would have in terms of female participation in the labour market.<\/p> <p>  My next question is to the ISME witnesses.  On skills shortages, have ISME members raised with the organisation concerns that they will be affected in this regard over the next two to five years and what sectors will be most affected?  On the public-private sector pay gap, how does ISME propose it be addressed in the upcoming budget?<\/p><p> I agree with the witness on insurance costs.  The speaker will be aware that Fianna F&aacute;il, particularly Deputy Michael McGrath, has done a considerable amount of work on insurance costs, not just this year but over the last several years.  We are working very hard on that, but if the witness has any specific recommendations for budget 2019 in that regard it would be great to hear them.   <\/p><p> I would agree with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce that Dublin's success is Ireland's success.  As somebody from a rural constituency on the west coast, I still think our capital needs to thrive and do well.  There are many people from my own constituency working and living in Dublin.  I did that myself for several years.  However, the witnesses spoke about using the rainy day fund as an insurance policy for the national development plan.  In Fianna F&aacute;il, our view is that the rainy day fund is there to prepare for a downturn if it happens.  In any budgetary process, from household budgeting to Government budgeting, it is always prudent to have some funds in reserve for when the unexpected may hit.  That is one area where we will need to keep some funds in reserve.  The national development plan as proposed should be funded separately to that, and there should be funds in place to ensure its continuance year-on-year and Government-on-Government. <\/p><p> In regard to the gap in female participation in the labour force, how is that specifically affecting the Dublin Chamber of Commerce's membership, and do the witnesses have any specific recommendations as to how we might address that in budget 2019? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#F00800","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I will address some of the queries and then bring my colleagues in.  When it comes to the buffering effect on the national development plan, we are very cognisant of the fact that in the recent crisis, 80% of the savings to the Exchequer came from stopping capital expenditure.  That is not a costless decision.  We are suffering the consequences of that now with a bottleneck arising from that lack of infrastructure spending.  When we refer to the rainy day fund, we feel that there should be a commitment to capital expenditure that is funded, and that there should be provision in the rainy day fund so that those projects can go on if there is a challenge to the Exchequer.  First, that would ensure that they actually get delivered.  However, we also have to be able to signal to large operators that upskilling and scaling up in Ireland are worth their while because there will be a pipeline of infrastructure projects and it will not be stop-go based on which stage of the economic cycle we are in.<\/p> <p>  We echo concerns about the 9% value-added tax, VAT, rate for the hospitality industry.  Obviously occupancy rates and prices in Dublin are fairly buoyant, but we are cognisant that it is not the same for the hospitality sector throughout the country.  We feel that this needs to be there to make sure that we continue to get regional balance.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Sharpe to address the participation rate and how we see that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Regarding the impact of low female workforce participation on members of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, we should say at the outset that there is a lot we could achieve here compared to our northern European counterparts.  The gap in labour market participation between men and women is currently 10.4%.  That is around the EU average, but that does not take into account the fact that there are wide variations in the EU, particularly between northern and southern Europe.  There is a gap of about 25% in Malta, while in Northern Europe countries like Denmark and Sweden achieve a gender gap in labour market participation of about 5%.  Our gap is double that.  If we could even get that 5% into the workforce, it could ease a lot of pressure in terms of skills availability and wage costs.<\/p> <p>  There is certainly a lot of business feedback to support the impact this is having on business.  Overall, more than three quarters of Dublin members report that the cost of childcare has a material impact on their business.  It affects both cost and availability of staff for 40% of our members.  It solely affects the availability of staff for a quarter of members and solely the cost of staff for one member in ten.  That is according to our most recent business risk outlook survey.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our specific asks, we welcome the single affordable childcare scheme as a positive step in the right direction.  We would like to see a significant expansion in fiscal support for that scheme in the coming year, specifically with a view to increasing female labour market participation.  Second, we would like to see an examination of the impact of the tax system on the decision of a second earner in a household to return to work.  This is something which tends to affect families and working couples, particularly at a higher income level.  Based on our engagement with officials in the Department of Finance, whose counterparts in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs we will engage with in the coming week, there has been no official study looking at the impact of this on female labour market participation.  We would like to see a proper examination of how the tax system serves to discourage second earners from returning to the workforce and how that will interact with the new affordable childcare scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Sharpe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>With regard to the question on the VAT situation, I would not disagree with the member.  A lot of the discussion around the 9% VAT rate relates to hotels in Dublin city centre.  The same clearly does not apply to rural hotels.  The 9% VAT rate cannot be seen solely with respect to hotels.  The 9% rate and the old 13.5% rate essentially related to labour-intensive Irish indigenous companies.  It went across a broad range of sectors, and I think that if we made that decision in one fell swoop without thinking of the consequences it would be a very difficult situation for an awful lot of people.<\/p> <p>  For example, I read last weekend that there was an Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report looking at productivity in the multinational sector and the indigenous sector.  In the small to medium enterprise, SME, sector, profit is 30% of wages on average.  If wage costs account for 30% of a company's cost structure and profit is 10%, most people would not regard that as unreasonable.  In other sectors however, profit could be a multiple of wages.  The ability of SMEs to withstand significant reductions in sales, through VAT increases or increases in costs such as insurance, is very limited.  We do not have a highly profitable SME sector in this country.  That is a fact.  We need to be really careful about putting it out there that if we make this change we will get &euro;500 million and there will be no impact on the SME sector.  That is complete nonsense.<\/p> <p>  A member asked about the public sector pay gap.  It is a tense topic when it comes up.  I think the first report of the Public Service Pay Commission was supposed to include international comparisons its scope.  The last time I looked there was one page on the international comparisons in the report.  There is a bunch of European studies on this topic.  There are some ESRI studies.  The ESRI did a report called \"Comparing Public and Private Sector Pay in Ireland: Size Matters\" by Elish Kelly, Seamus McGuinness and Philip J. O'Connell in 2012.  That is worth looking at.  I think the European Central Bank wrote some papers on the topic.  There are at least two or three European papers on the topic.  The research is there.  If the Public Service Pay Commission is going to write a paper, it should really put all the evidence and data in there.  If we are going to make decisions on this stuff, let us make value decisions.  Let us not just make it up as we go along.  Let us look at the evidence, see what it says and if we are going to make a decision, make that decision.  However, we should do it in full knowledge of all the evidence available to us, both within Ireland and in the European context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Coghlan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>To round out that point, the international comparisons we were promised in phase one of the Public Service Pay Commission need to be finished before any further reports are generated.  We are not naive.  We know there is not going to be a reduction in public service pay.  However, there needs to be a recognition of the value of public service pensions.  Second, when the pressure comes on it is fair to ask public sector workers for efficiencies and modernisation in exchange.  Across the board, members know the pressures that are there in health. education and justice.  There needs to be change.

I will make three points if I might, to try to deal with the questions raised.  The VAT rate was introduced when it was in order to pass on to customers.  The crash had just happened and it was an attempt to try to keep life in the restaurant and hospitality sector in the main.<\/p><p>The National Competitiveness Council, in its most recent report, points out that this is what has happened in the hospitality sector.  One of the largest increases in prices was in restaurants - up 8.4% between 2013 and 2017.  Irish hotels and restaurant prices are now 20% above the EU 28 and eurozone average.  The CSO estimates that inflation in restaurants and hotels was twice the rate for all items between 2010 and 2017.  It certainly did not succeed in doing anything on price.<\/p><p> As to whether it will deal with jobs, there are lots of statistics, not only on Dublin, on bedroom price rates, etc.  The Irish Hotels Federation has published its own statistics on this and one can see where this is not only a Dublin issue but happens right across the country.  The price levels in the west and the mid-west are not the same as those in Dublin but there are price hikes in all of the hotels.  The hospitality sector is doing well.<\/p><p> On the jobs issue, a majority of the firms in this sector earn a small proportion of sector turnover and, in fact, do not employ large numbers of people.  The reason I say so is many of them do not have a turnover.  Those referred to in the constituencies mentioned do not have a turnover that requires them to register for VAT in the first place and, therefore, it does not apply to them.  That is the first point.  The second point is that two thirds of the revenue in this sector goes to 5% of firms with an annual turnover of more than &euro;2 million.  That tells one the reduced VAT rate is being sucked up by big profitable global companies in this country which do lots of fast food and all the stuff I am sure I am not allowed to mention.  The committee members know the companies I am talking about.  They are loving it and they are eating it up.  That is the main part.  If one goes to any Revenue, CSO or other statistics, one will find that is the case.  We are handing them a reduced VAT rate and they are loving it.  Every year, they make more profits than they made the year before.<\/p><p> The tourism sector and Tourism Ireland will tell the committee in any presentation they make that the profile of tourism in Ireland is changing a great deal because of their work.  Tourism Ireland is going to Asia, etc.  The statistics for the UK are available.  One in 20 who visits from the UK is an Irish person.  Half of UK visitors are visiting family and friends.  Those are the statistics.<\/p><p> On the Brexit fund, we have had discussions with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to try to get to a situation where, for instance, in agrifood, which, as the Chairman and I both know from sitting on the Brexit stakeholder forum, is the first vulnerable sector according to the indications of all the figures, we have worked out a strategic plan which either reskills or retrains those workers or supplements job acquisition in other sectors as with the Globalisation Fund, and that we have that ready rather than waiting to go to a canteen and tell 50 workers their jobs are gone.  We want to be ready with that Brexit assistance fund.  We, as a movement, can work with employers to identify those employments and to identify the ways and means of doing it.<\/p><p> Finally, on the participation rate, data tells us that instead of looking holistically at unemployment we should be looking at what is the participation rate.  Ireland's rate is lower than that of most in the EU.  We are at 67% for female participation.  No doubt a major contributory factor to this is the high cost of childcare.  We are second highest when it comes to couples.  We are highest in terms of the provision of childcare for lone parents.  It is one of the strongest features in dealing with participation.  Of course, young girls are better performers than young boys in school.  They are coming out of the education system with good skills yet we end up in a situation where we are losing.  It behoves everybody to deal with the female participation rate in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a number of the questions that I had an interest in and they have been covered.  I thank the three organisations for their interesting presentations.<\/p> <p>  None of them mentioned single people with no dependants who make up 25% of the workforce.  I am always intrigued by this.  It is a significant cohort of the workforce.  Such people probably have more demands on them because they cannot share those financial demands.  I would be interested in their feedback on that.  No one ever mentions the single person.  As I said, if they do not have dependants, then every outgoing is dealt with singlehandedly by them.  What is their view on that?  It is not particularly connected with any of their contributions.<\/p> <p>  I would not favour ISME now opening up the public and private sector debate at all, to be honest, because it is provocative.  In its contribution, ISME states \"the majority of our so-called fiscal space is being diverted into public payroll\".  That is factually wrong for this year.  When one goes through what is available in the fiscal space, that does not stand up in terms of payroll.  ISME needs to correct that because it will start a debate.  Even in respect of the words \"the majority of\", is that 90% or 63% of it?  From the figures that have been presented thus far, it is factually wrong.<\/p> <p>  Everybody is talking about Brexit and getting Brexit-ready, but nobody is talking about the USA and what is already happening in terms of trade wars.  It has begun and it is beginning to have an impact on what we talk about in foreign direct investment.  That is why I want to come back to what ISME has said about successive budgets prioritising multinational corporations.  ISME asks us to bear that in mind as we consider budget 2019.  Certainly, I am taking that on.  I would like to see enterprise measures proposed or some kind of thrust towards that.

We all know people in the public sector.  All my family are in the public sector and it is not a popular topic to raise at home.  This is not an issue of absolutes.  This is an issue of priorities.  The issue for us is what happens when one has the sorts of problems that we have identified in health, in housing and in childcare and when one knows that that gap, as a matter of fact established by the CSO, exists.  I have ended up in barneys about this previously.  One need only look at the monthly earning statistics.  It is a matter of fact.  We are saying it is up to the members, as legislators, to prioritise but we think the priority needs to be on the capital side.  If this will get sucked out in the so-called \"restoration\" debate and into areas of public pay expenditure which attract pensions with a long tail effect, we do not consider that is a wise long-term proposition.<\/p> <p>  On the Brexit and USA question, in fairness, we started off in our pre-budget submission trying not to \"Jonah\" when we say it.  We do not want to give the impression that the sky will fall in and, therefore, we have phrased it carefully.  We acknowledge the trade situation.  What is coming out of the United States is every bit as threatening as what is happening in London.  We have previously said we identify some of the Commissioners in Brussels as having an agenda that is inimical to our current economic policy.  Frankly, we see threats around us.  We have spent a bit of time in our pre-budget submission on the sorts of measures that would work for our indigenous enterprise.  Dublin Chamber has covered many of them.<\/p><p>We ask the committee to consider the issue of intergenerational transfer, in particular, in the area of capital gains.  We have this figured out for agriculture.  Whereas a capital gain is not considered to arise when a farm moves from one generation to another, the Revenue considers that a capital gain arises when a business moves from one generation to another.  What is actually happening in both cases is that a going concern is transferred from one person to another and a capital gain does not arise unless the asset is liquidated.  Our tax system needs to recognise that.  I am conscious that the next group before the committee will recommend an increase in capital gains tax.  Such an increase would be revenue negative for the State.  If the State wants to increase revenue from capital gains, it needs to reduce capital gains tax because the rate is far too high and is applied inconsistently compared with other countries.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>The Deputy did not address any questions to me and I am sure the Chairman will not allow a debate on the public and private sectors - if only he would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I will not do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#J00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>There we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>As we have only ten minutes remaining in this session, we will not finish on time.

It is appropriate that Irish businesses are being encouraged to open establishments in the UK to prepare themselves for the period after Brexit and we are also inviting UK businesses to open establishments in Ireland.  This is where competitiveness and some of the differences in tax treatment move from the theoretical to the wholly practical.  To develop a business of scale in Ireland, it is necessary to move outside the Irish market.  The UK is typically the first location to which companies move to grow their business and markets.<\/p> <p>  On the tax system, we propose an increase in entrepreneur relief.  The current structure of the relief incentivises cashing out of a business early in the cycle.  Our proposal to increase the lifetime cap to &euro;15 million would encourage Irish investors to maintain their base in Ireland and grow their business.  We also propose allowing income tax relief on dividends to entrepreneurs, perhaps within the same cap.  This would focus the relief on the entrepreneur retaining an involvement in the business, rather than having all of the tax incentive generated at the time of the disposal of the business.<\/p> <p>  Our proposals address the stage at which businesses might be considered for sale and the practical issues of establishment in the UK.

The key issues are related to evaluations and, in practical terms, the obligation to issue share options at market value, which creates a compliance burden and a legal risk for SMEs.  While guidance was issued, only one paragraph was published and this is creating uncertainty and discouraging many SMEs from engaging with KEEP.<\/p> <p>  A second issue is the restriction on the total market value of share options offered to an individual to not more than 50% of his or her annual remuneration.

While I agree with that - I do not see how anyone could disagree - I do not understand, based on the submissions made by ISME and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, where we will get the money for this expenditure.  The witnesses argue for reductions in taxes to incentivise small and medium enterprises.  If we provide further research and development tax credits to SMEs, open up the knowledge development box to SMEs and reduce VAT and capital gains tax, as the witnesses propose, where will we get the money for all the infrastructure and housing we need?  Something does not add up.<\/p> <p>  My answer to all of this is straightforward.  In my view, tax expenditures are not the best way to help the domestic economy.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  We are losing large amounts of money through tax reliefs.  Surely we are foregoing far too much revenue through tax reliefs.  Even the European Commission has made that point.  The major beneficiaries of tax reliefs are the big multinational corporations.  Property speculators are also doing very well and making enormous profits.  Why would we give away more in tax reliefs when common sense suggests we should reduce them?<\/p> <p>  I was also slightly confused by the statement in the ISME submission that a \"collective amnesia of how the fiscal and property crashes of 2008 occurred in Ireland has infected the trade unions, the public services, and a plurality of Oireachtas members.\"  While I fully agree that there is amnesia about the fiscal and property crash, I do not see how it is largely manifested in the trade unions or public service.  I am not sure what the expression, \"a plurality of Oireachtas members\" means.  The amnesia appears to be largely in the Government and relates to what happens when property speculators are allowed to control the housing market and given tax incentives to do it all over again.  They are evidently engaging in rampant speculation and profiteering, while delivering little affordable housing.

Our judgment is that there should be a massive effort now regarding the construction of social and affordable housing and that it should be at the level of 10,000 units per year.  It is clear that what is being done falls far short of that if one considers that the number of social houses built in 2017 was 780.  That is far off the mark.  From our point of view, any plan should entail the construction of 10,000 units per year.<\/p> <p>  Under HAP, the private market is expected to provide social housing.  As market rents increase, the same bad accommodation is available at a higher price.  The State is strongly engaging in the market now and is partially responsible for the rent rises because there is such a scarcity of new units coming on stream to provide social and affordable housing.  The State is moving around in circles.  It has identified public lands and states it has identified money for housing construction.  If it has the main pieces in place, why not just go ahead and do it?  That sounds like a simple question but it deserves an answer from someone.  From our perspective, we hope and expect that the budget will start to provide an answer to that question.  We agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on the misdirection of funds through HAP and various schemes.<\/p> <p>  I will not deal with the issue of amnesia.  Some groups on the employer side make statements about us which I do not give much credibility because they are nonsense.  I do not have time for them.

When it comes to the issue of affordable housing, we absolutely agree that expenditure on housing assistance does not increase the stock of housing.  The problem is one of supply and demand.  The lack of supply is causing the problems.  State intervention in the private market to acquire or rent private accommodation does not help matters.  We could get a much greater effect from the moneys being spent if local authorities built social and affordable housing.  That must be part of the solution.  Expecting the market to solve a housing issue is the reason we are in this position.  Solving housing problems is not the purpose of the market.<\/p> <p>  On labour shortages, we have the results of surveys showing the number of our members who anticipate taking on new hires and the number of open jobs in small and medium enterprises and major multinationals.  We have a labour shortage and there are issues surrounding recruiting abroad, particularly for skilled candidates.  Sometimes these roles are filled and the employee leaves after three or six months because he or she cannot find housing.  Housing is the single biggest barrier to people moving here to take up roles.  It is also a barrier to Irish people being retained in jobs.  Housing is, therefore, a highly topical issue.<\/p> <p>  As we indicated, the impact of affordable childcare on female labour market participation is a key issue.  This is a cohort of the population whose members generate considerable costs in terms of education and development and then suddenly leave the workforce because tax or childcare issues impact on the rational decisions of the couple or family in question.<\/p> <p>  On our proposals for tax reliefs for entrepreneurs, we are mindful of the over-reliance on foreign direct investment in our industrial policy.  While this policy has served us well to date, given the changes with Brexit and in the US, we need to focus on growing indigenous businesses.  The proposals we have made are modest in terms of their cost but address the issues.  Entrepreneurs are choosing to exit businesses too early because it is the only way for them to realise some of the value.  Alternatively, they choose to move to Northern Ireland or the UK.  We are, therefore, already seeing a loss to the Exchequer in terms of revenue that would be gained if these businesses were allowed to grow and develop in scale here and provide employment.<\/p> <p>  Some of the issues we have addressed concern signalling to the market.  We have been very successful in our industrial policy in respect of foreign direct investment, FDI.  Our success in this area has been well recognised internationally.  However, we now find ourselves in a position when it comes to indigenous business that the UK is more attractive on every single measure.  We are suggesting not only that we attain UK levels of competitiveness but that we exceed them when it comes to small and medium-sized enterprises.<\/p> <p>  All of the measures we propose are set out in the preliminary recommendations document.  One measure, the proposal to adjust the cap on qualifying gains for entrepreneur relief from capital gains tax from &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million, would generate a cost of &euro;2 million.  While the cost of the relief would increase from &euro;54 million to &euro;56 million, the adjustment would sent out a signal that Ireland is a place that welcomes and supports entrepreneurs.  Our proposal on the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit, would not generate any additional costs as it is a timing issue.  It is a matter of whether research money is provided upfront or is reclaimed over a period.  While the total cost would be roughly the same, for a cash-strapped start-up company, it is important to access research funding early as it could go out of business within the three years for which it must wait for it.<\/p> <p>  The costs of our proposals are not material.  What is significant is the direction of travel and the signalling to entrepreneurs that this is a country where it is attractive to set up, grow and retain a business and one which does not incentivise entrepreneurs to exit early.  All of those provisions are in the recommendations document.  The recommendation on capital gains tax, CGT, is to encourage people to invest in high-risk Irish businesses rather than international blue-chip businesses.  The issue for us is more the impact of the recommendations than their cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Rose Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>The amnesia to which we refer in a very broad, Catholic sense of the word concerns the tax base.  Back in the day - and this is why we were asking people to think back to 2008 - we had a known exposure on transaction taxes.  Lo and behold, when these revenues disappeared, we were left in the position in which we now find ourselves.  Our exposure is on income tax, particularly sectoral income taxes, and corporation tax, which I know is a whole other issue and there are dangers that could potentially undermine that.  The question for the members, as legislators, is if these two tax heads came under severe strain, we will return to the pain and suffering faced by the public sector, in which an awful lot of pain was absorbed ten years ago, and the private sector, which absorbed 300,000 redundancies.  That is what the word &quot;amnesia&quot; refers to. <br\/><br\/>Regarding tax reliefs, which is what I believe Deputy Boyd Barrett was referring to, oddly enough, we probably agree with him on that point.  I think he is reading us wrong on this because our point is that these reliefs are being structured for multinationals.  The Department of Finance admits there is no penetration of these reliefs.  If the Deputy listens to what Dublin Chamber of Commerce and ISME are saying, he will understand that there is no penetration of the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, the employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, the knowledge development box or any of these schemes.  They go straight over the heads of small businesses, which are not able to avail of them.  Therefore, arguably, while the members, as legislators, are meant to design tax reliefs that have socially desirable outcomes, they are not having these outcomes for the sector that is employing half the working population.  That is our dilemma.  The schemes need to be structured.  We are not saying we should get a pass on tax.  There is a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>in that the State and society would also get something useful.<br\/><br\/>Lastly, regarding income tax, Deputy Boyd Barrett asked where the money would come from.  This will be a difficult issue.  We have made no secret of the fact that we effectively cut and paste the Irish Tax Institute's 20 key asks into our submission.  We reconfigured them in the order that our members found most valuable.  Income tax is levied in such a way that once a person's income exceeds the average industrial wage of &euro;36,000, his or her tax bill starts going upward very quickly.<\/p><p>In many ways, that productivity is a good thing but above &euro;70,000, one is at Nordic and German rates of taxation.  The difficulty is when one goes back the other way, where we are at low or no taxation.  We know we have huge, long-term issues such as the pension deficit.  We will not necessarily openly agree with the trade union sector on this but we know that social spending and the social insurance take have to increase.  It is likely that that will have to be paid by the individual.  People will have to pay for themselves in the long term because they live so much longer after retirement age.  The Deputy will probably hear responses that he will like from the employers' sector on this but we need to think about how we will have a sustainable tax system in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank the various groups for coming in and for their presentations.  Some were very specific and others were quite broad.  It is coming near to the time where we have to be much more specific, especially when one sees the statement made by the Minister for Finance today.  It behoves us all to look at the realities that exist and make recommendations based on the realities that we can work within.  We also have to be mindful that we are talking about a budget for 2019.  We are not necessarily talking about the next five or ten years, or anything like that.  When one looks at the specifics and hears what the witnesses have been saying, it boils down to three things.  Those are: housing; the cost of living and the cost of business, particularly with regard to insurance and housing and its impact on the ability to generate jobs, especially in cities where costs are exorbitant; and the area of infrastructure.  Looking at what is available and how we address those issues, if one compares and contrasts what was envisaged last year, it was &euro;3.2 billion, while the Minister talked about &euro;3.4 billion today.  It is really &euro;3.9 billion, because &euro;500 million is a given for the rainy day fund, something that we stitched into our agreement with the Government, and it is not up for discussion, as far as we are concerned.  Thereafter, the Minister talks about &euro;2.6 billion already being committed.  That is made up of &euro;1.5 billion for the national development plan, &euro;400 million for demographics, &euro;400 million for public pay and &euro;300 million as a carryover.  We are now at &euro;2.6 billion.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses, my constituents, those in my party and I need to know about the &euro;1.5 billion committed to the national development plan in 2019.  Where, specifically, is that being spent and what, specifically, is that being spent on, so that the witnesses can evaluate whether that is value for money and if it will yield progress in areas in which the witnesses have concerns?  We will ask the Minister to elaborate on that in the short term so that the witnesses can evaluate that and make further contributions if necessary.  That leaves &euro;800 million, notwithstanding the commitment that has been made at our insistence about the public pay issue for new entrants.  That is a &euro;200 million cost in one year.  Whether that is agreed between Government and the unions over one, two or three years, we will support that.  That is a given.  It might well be back to &euro;700 million.<\/p> <p>  Now we are talking about priorities.  Where are the priorities?  We all recognise and acknowledge that there is a crisis and emergency in housing.  It not only impinges on the poor unfortunates in the midst of that with regard to social and affordable housing, it also impacts on jobs, the ability to attract jobs and to allow people to meet the demands placed upon them.  We do not want that transferred to wage demand.  We want the Government to address that with regard to the cost of living that the witnesses mentioned.  From what ICTU is saying and in response to the questions put to us by others, it is not necessarily an issue whereby one increases the level of funding towards the provision of housing, whether social or affordable.  It is how it is spent.  It is not being spent wisely or appropriately, and it is not yielding a return.  What do the witnesses believe the solution to this is?  It is not just throwing more money at it and saying that local authorities will build them.  Unfortunately, they are not building them.  We believe an agency is needed to attract not only Government funding but private funding that can take charge of State lands, build these units and lease them back to local authorities for 100 years.  That is the sort of innovation that we want to hear and see rather than more of the same.  It is easy for me to say that local government is only spending 20% of what was spent on social housing in 2008 and to increase that by 20% would improve it all of a sudden.  It does not.  We saw that with health in the past.<\/p> <p>  To get back to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, its issue is with infrastructure and improving the atmosphere in which business can flourish, and how development and specific spending on the capital side can improve that, whether on the Luas in Dublin or public transport issues in less populated areas, how that is improved and how business in those areas can improve.  One cannot be in a qualified position to make judgment on that until provision for the extra spending in the development plan is qualified and quantified.  Have the witnesses any specific proposals?  I welcome what is being said about insurance costs and the concrete proposals put before us.  We would like to see more of that.  My colleague asked a question with regard to ICTU.  Start prioritising.  We would all like to see improvements that I hope will happen over time but, with regard to the 2019 budget, we have a job to do in this committee, and thankfully it is being done in an open and transparent manner and people can see that nothing is going on behind closed doors, so do not be afraid of making firm, concrete proposals that we can analyse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#L00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I ask the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the first response to Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#L00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I ask my colleague, Dr. Ger Gibbons, to deal precisely with the issues of housing that the Deputy has raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Our proposals were devised before the summer economic statement so we have not had the opportunity to look at that in sufficient detail.

That amounts to an underspend of approximately &euro;12 billion a year.  We will not get to that.  That will take a number of years, a decade or so, if we decide to achieve that level.  We agree that the underspend of what is proposed, the net fiscal space this year, is considerably less than what it should be.  In our pre-budget proposals, we will propose additional revenue measures of approximately &euro;1.3 billion.  That would include things such as the abolition of the 9% VAT rate that the Department of Finance has estimated would raise approximately &euro;500 million.  We propose that approximately &euro;500 million in additional spending be allocated to social and affordable housing next year.  In rough terms, that could build over 2,500 social and affordable homes next year, if we decided to do that.  It was done in the past, in the 1940s and 1970s.  It should not be beyond us.  We went from 600 homes in 1946 and 1947 to approximately 11,000 in 1950 and 1951.

When one rounded up the discussions there, their ills were all blamed on the Department.  I had several discussions with officials from the Department.  When that was all rounded up, where did that go?  I am saying this in simple, plain terms.  It is not easy to resolve.  The committee is, in my opinion, homing in on a very strong point of issue that needs to be dealt with by the establishment.  There is an extended labour-employer economic forum which will start in July and one module will be housing, at which the trade unions will take the opportunity, working directly with officials and the Minister involved, to see if we can unlock some of this and at least have people identify what the obstacles are.

We would welcome more detail on the breakdown of spending under the national development plan in the coming year.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce has been clear on its priority projects.  I take the Deputy's point that we are taking a one year view, rather than the full lifespan of the plan, but many of the projects we are discussing are a decade long and we believe much of the funding plan needs to start soon.  Metro north is a key project, to serve both Swords and the growing population of the county of Fingal which now has the third largest population in the country, as well as to connect the airport and the city centre.  It includes the DART expansion programme which includes the DART underground project which has been postponed repeatedly and redesigned for about half a century, as well as the electrification of the Hazelhatch and Maynooth lines.  These are things that could be done in a shorter timeframe.  Specifically, on the DART underground project, the National Transport Authority has been keen to maintain enough funding for it to be kept live, which would be an achievement in itself in the coming year.  BusConnect is important, as is the eastern and midlands regional water supply project.  Members will have heard about recent events in Skerries and fears about further water shortages in the capital in the coming days.  That is an issue that must be addressed urgently.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry Cowen is correct about the effectiveness of spending on social housing.  We have been very clear that there has to be a shift from reliance on the private sector to deliver a public good, namely, social housing.  Reliance on the housing assistance payment, HAP, and continually pouring money into it is not a solution.  It adds pressure on the private rental sector without improving the size of the overall housing stock.  We would be open to having an agency.  Our submission to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government last year during the review of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan suggested something along these lines.  We suggested residential development in the greater Dublin area which is the epicentre of the accommodation crisis be joined with infrastructural planning and that there be a central agency for that purpose.  We are agnostic on its structure, but there should be a point of co-ordination.  Our hope is the metropolitan area strategic plan which forms the subsidiary level of the national planning framework will be the means by which it will be brought together, but we would love to see a single point of accountability to drive it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Sharpe"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sharpe.

That stuff worked well for many years and is still doing so, but perhaps it needs to be tweaked a little.  However, this is the time to have a strategic review of industrial policy and perhaps add a third leg.  IDA Ireland is doing a great job when it comes to foreign direct investment, Enterprise Ireland is doing good work when it comes to exports and local enterprise offices, LEOs, and so on when it comes to microbusiness, but where is the policy on small and medium-sized enterprises?  There is none.  Our big statement is that it is time we had a strategic review and to think ten years out.

I might send it to the chamber as I would like to hear its opinion on it.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Sharpe answered the question about the national planning framework.  <\/p> <p>  In response to Ms King and Dr. Gibbons of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Government spending must prioritise spending aimed at mitigating risk and enhancing resilience in the economy.  If the reduction in the VAT rate for the hospitality sector was to be removed, coupled with an increase in the national minimum wage, what negative effects for the industry would they anticipate?  I ask the question in the context of the 148,000 people employed in the hospitality sector, including 15,500 in the Border counties and 50,000 in Dublin.  It is easy to make a sweeping statement without understanding what the outcome and knock-on effect would be.

If we were to look at the fiscal rules and adhere to them, particularly the expenditure benchmark - the benchmark that has been implemented for the past number of years - they are there for a reason and that is to prevent this boom-and-bust cycle of the economy.  If we were to meet the expenditure benchmark next year, and the Government even states this, we would have an additional &euro;900 million on top of this year.  I am talking about this year and I am just giving the facts.  By adhering to the fiscal rules and meeting the targets under the expenditure benchmark, we could have &euro;1.7 billion rather than &euro;800 million.  If we take the rainy day fund the Government proposes, which is &euro;500 million and with which I do not agree because we need to spend the money now, we could potentially have &euro;2.2 billion extra allocated next year and still meet the targets under the fiscal rules, as opposed to &euro;700 million under Fianna F&aacute;il.

I thank the committee for this invitation.  We are grateful for that and for the opportunity to meet the members of the committee and present some ideas.  We have supplied the committee with a copy of our Budget Choices policy briefing, which sets out a fully costed budget, comprising all the expenditure and all the sources of financing, producing a balanced budget at the end of the day.<\/p> <p>  Budgets at the end of the day are about choices and they are critically important to shaping the future of society.  The reality is that ten years ago we had a crash of serious proportions.  The damage done through the economic and budgetary crisis of the last decade is still being felt by Ireland's vulnerable people.  Despite the tremendous recovery in the economy with our getting close to full employment, low unemployment and having tremendous success on a variety of different fronts, the reality still is that almost 800,000 people are living in poverty, the largest proportion of whom are children.  We still have a housing crisis, which has removed the most basic of social nets from those living on the edge, and we still have not found the political courage to say that Ireland is a low revenue economy that needs to raise some new taxes, not for it to become a high tax economy but to fund vital social infrastructure.  <\/p> <p>  Interestingly, 15 years ago when we as an organisation were trying to get the Government of the day to deal with the then housing situation and to address some other issues, we were constantly warned about the danger of making those kinds of proposals because they would kill the goose that was laying the golden egg of the Celtic tiger but that goose got cooked.  We cannot make any kind of investment because we do not have that money.  I remember preparing a detailed policy briefing and meeting the then Secretary General of the Department of Finance for an hour and a half.  He said there was no way they could deal with the housing issue to which I replied that a few years down the line we would have housing issues.  I was told they were not dealing with it and there was no engagement of any kind.  The time for dealing with it was apparently wrong again then.  <\/p> <p>  Now we are in a new space.  We hear that everything is flying but we also hear that we should not spend money because the danger is that it could overheat the economy.  That raises the question as to whether the time is ever right.  We as an organisation are saying that now is the time; this is the time.  We need to address the key infrastructural deficits we have.  Ireland has the resources and the capacity to build a fairer future for everybody.  That would involve us raising a certain amount of additional tax over a period of time.  We have set out on page 3 of our briefing document the way in which we calculate that.  It would not even change our position with respect to our relative total tax take.  If we compare all the taxes across Europe, our proposal would not turn us into a high tax country, it would just maintain our current position.  We believe that over a few years we need to raise an additional &euro;3 billion to deal with matters such as the demographic issue, the fact we will have many older people, the housing issue, infrastructural issues such as public transport, rural broadband and a number of other issues.  Now is the appropriate time to do some serious work on that.  <\/p> <p>  We talk about the importance of vision.  Every politician would acknowledge that they have some vision of what the future should be.  We suggest that people need to work for five outcomes - not in any particular sequence but they need to be worked on together - if we are to have a society that values human dignity, equality, human rights, solidarity and sustainability and those types of principles.  It is not a question of getting the economy right and everything else will follow.  We have been there over and over again and that does not work.  The five outcomes to be worked for are a vibrant economy, just taxation, decent services and infrastructure, good governance and sustainability.  On page 3 of our briefing document we set out in some detail what that means, which I will not go into now.  In the context of where we are at, we would strongly argue that budgets need to be both economically sound and socially fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1529420400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Deputy Colm Brophy resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>We are very strong on the choices in our proposals, which when put together are economically sound and socially fair.  The European Union's country-specific recommendations for the 2019 budget propose that we should limit the scope and number of tax expenditures, broaden the tax base and prepare for age-related expenditure increases, with all of which we agree.  We also welcome the emphasis on the need to improve infrastructure and skills, with which we agree.  We also agree with the EU's focus on the need to pay special attention to digital skills, taking account of the new digital strategy and the way the world of work will be transformed by artificial intelligence and so on and the implications of that.  We do not believe the Commission has put enough emphasis on the need to address poverty, social housing and healthcare on the scale required.  It mentions them but does not give them the priority required.<\/p> <p>  The sustainable development goals are another matter we consider to be very important.  Everybody is familiar with the chart in that respect, which is very colourful setting out the 17 goals, the detail of which we have all grasped.  Ireland played a major role as co-chair of the group that put those goals together for the United Nations.  Now they are three years old.  There are not supposed to be merely a chart on a wall or a desk, rather they are meant to be  implemented.  All countries have a responsibility in that respect.  Let us do that now.  We do not believe the plan that the Government has put in place to implement them is sufficient or on the scale required to address them, but it is a beginning.  There will be a voluntary report made to the United Nations in July.  We are part of a group putting together a shadow report to assist in that.  When the Government makes policy decisions, we recommend it should badge each policy decision by the appropriate sustainable development goal.  In our policy briefing, which sets all our proposals on the budget, at the top of every page we list the relevant sustainable development goals that apply or that are being met with those particular things.<\/p> <p>  We propose a slight increase in taxation and investment, particularly in one-off items that do not recur such as social housing, public transport and so on.  The proposals we have included are detailed later in the briefing document which I will cover later.  We propose an investment of an additional &euro;1.25 billion in social housing, bearing in mind that we have close to 90,000 households on waiting lists for social housing.  As for the idea that if we provide 3,500 social housing units, that would be great gaisce, the scale of what is required needs to be seriously taken on board.  The current programme for housing is not of a sufficient scale to deal with the problem that exists.  Substantially, that would be our top investment.<\/p> <p>  Our second would be on healthcare and disability.  We propose an investment of more than &euro;1 billion, including a one-off allocation of &euro;500 million to get Sl&aacute;intecare up and running.  We also propose an investment of more than &euro;500 million in a rural development programme to provide for regional development with a very strong focus on resourcing communities because communities have lost out badly.  They have not recovered the types of funding they had ten years ago.<\/p><p>On the tax side, the key issues are standard rating all discretionary tax expenditures, removing the tax refund element of the research and development tax credit and introducing a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 6%.  We also recommend that taxation on diesel and petrol be equalised, that VAT on the accommodation sector be raised to 13.5% and that VAT on food be raised to that level next year.<\/p><p> There is a detailed run-down of our proposals on expenditure, income and tax changes on pages 16 and 17 and a balancing thereof on page 18.  We are happy to answer any questions on those figures.  We have a policy framework to deliver the five outcomes I discussed - a thriving economy; decent infrastructure and services; just taxation; good governance; and sustainability.

We appreciate the opportunity to offer our input.<\/p> <p>  TASC is an independent organisation and is not politically affiliated or associated with any institution.  We examine issues related to inequality and democracy in Ireland and the EU.  The research to which we will refer today and which is in the presentation sent to the committee was largely conducted in partnership with the Foundation for European Progressive Studies in Brussels, which receives money from the European Parliament.  Because of who we are as an organisation and our interests, we wish to emphasise in our remarks the importance of addressing the causes of economic and social inequality in the budget.  Inequality is not the same as poverty, although reducing poverty rates is a critical objective.  Inequality relates to differences in income and access to resources in general such as housing and jobs, which in turn provide economic security and enhanced well-being.  We are focusing on inequality because it concerns the relationship citizens in Ireland have with each other and the opportunities they have to improve their lives.  It also affects how people view themselves and society, their emotions concerning their social position and their individual self-confidence and ambitions or hope for the future.  As shown by the data we sent to the committee, Ireland's inequality rates are approximately average for the EU but, as we noted in our Cherishing All Equally reports and the presentations we sent to the committee, that standing is due to the high level of income transfers from the State to the bottom 40% and the income distribution.  As mentioned in the previous session, it can be misleading to compare Ireland to other European Union countries as they have very diverse economic and political histories.  In the table presented to the committee, we focus on comparing Ireland to other countries with small, open economies and the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  We believe the budget should aim to address at least some of the obstacles to economic opportunity and the achievement of individual aspirations.  Despite the uncertainty of Brexit, as mentioned in the previous session, and the current political and economic challenges to the European Union, Ireland's economic growth is strong and the Government is in a position to invest in areas needed to help individual citizens and households gain more security and establish goals.  It is the right time to seriously address economic inequality in the European Union.  The table illustrates that our inequality research has shown that the top 10% pay the least in comparison to similar other small, open economies but receive the most in governmental income transfers amongst these countries.  Transfers paid essentially refer to taxation, especially the category tax on income and social insurance contributions.  The low share of transfers paid by the top 10% in Ireland reflects their low levels of social insurance contributions.  The transfers received comprise mostly State benefits such as the old age pension, unemployment benefit and family and child allowances.  The top 10% in Ireland particularly benefits from child and family allowances in comparison with the other countries, probably because of the fertility rate in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The bottom 40%, on which TASC is focusing, depends heavily on transfers because of low wages and-or lack of secure employment.  The research, which compares Ireland to other EU economies, shows it is an outlier because of the low percentage of wages within overall income.  Labour income is close to half of pre-tax income in most of the other countries studied but in Ireland it is only a quarter.  In the United Kingdom, the most inegalitarian country we have studied, the bottom 40% earn just over a third of their income through the labour market.  The flip side of the weak earning power and low wages in the labour market in Ireland is the high levels of transfers received and the low levels of transfers paid.  The bottom 40% in Ireland receive almost three quarters of their income in transfers from the State and pay just 4% of their income in transfers or taxes.<\/p> <p>  We recommend addressing this imbalance by investing in public services such as childcare, which was mentioned frequently in the previous session, that enable more people, especially women, to work and investing more in social housing.  To save time, I will not go into that in detail.  I wish to emphasise that investing in public services such as childcare or healthcare avoids the stigma of means-tested benefits in income transfers which tend to segregate  particular income groups.  Inequality creates social divisions and addressing it requires a strategy to promote social solidarity.  It also affects growth.  The report sent to us on gender budgeting cites the International Monetary Fund, IMF, as stating that inequality can promote growth and, in particular, labour force participation by women.  To save time, I will not address female labour force participation in Ireland as the statistics were mentioned quite frequently in the previous session.  The gap in the participation rate between men and women in Ireland is close to the European Union average but, of the EU 15, only Greece, Spain and Italy have a larger gap between men and women, so it is an issue in Ireland.  Furthermore, going back to the point on low wages, the National Women's Council of Ireland indicates that 70% of part-time workers are women, which prevents them from saving or accessing the necessary support services to improve their position.  That again raises the issue of childcare.  Not surprisingly, approximately one quarter of the Irish female population is at risk of poverty.<\/p> <p>  We make four recommendations based on our research.  The first is to invest in childcare, although I will not go into the details of that because of what was mentioned in the first session, and to build more social housing, which was also dealt with.  On childcare, a point that was not made is that it is good for children and is not just about women's labour force participation.  The Government early years strategy report, Right from the Start, published by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2013, identified enhancing and extending quality early childhood care in education services as one of its five priorities.  It made a number of recommendations, including that investment in early childcare and education services increase incrementally each year to achieve the international benchmark of 1% of gross domestic product, GDP, by the end of the strategy.  The report was published in 2013 and current investment is under 0.6% of GDP.  Childcare should not be thought of solely in terms of women's participation in the labour force and it should be remembered that it is good for children.<\/p> <p>  We did not recommend a figure for healthcare because that was dealt with in the first session.  However, we wish to point out that increased access is required, according to our research.  Many of the people with whom we have been in touch through our studies do not have access to healthcare because they make too much money but those people may have insecure employment or wages that are too low, so we need to figure out a way for them to access universal primary care in particular even if their wages exceed the threshold to qualify for the medical card.<\/p> <p>  We recommend two revenue-raising mechanisms.  Mr. Sweeney will deal with questions on the first recommendation, which is to raise &euro;294 million by adding a third rate of income tax, of 43%, for incomes above &euro;120,000.  The second recommendation is to raise revenue of &euro;1 billion by standardising pension tax relief at 20%.  I will conclude by further explaining the pension tax relief.  We want to protect universal payments, about which there is no argument, and we believe there is scope to reduce tax subsidies which disproportionately benefit those in the top income brackets.  In particular, approximately three quarters of tax relief on private pension contributions benefit the top 20% in terms of income distribution, which group is arguably least in need of such relief.  One could say that pension tax relief is ostensibly a way of incentivising savings but it functions more to shelter the incomes of the already privileged.  In terms of cost to the Exchequer, the Irish system is among the most expensive in the OECD in spite of our relatively young population.  Recent analysis by the ESRI shows that granting tax relief at the standard tax rate of 20% rather than the marginal rate of 40% would yield savings of approximately &euro;1 billion.  It further notes that the impact on savings behaviour is likely to be minimal.  One does not want people stuffing their pensions full of income because they are trying to protect it from taxes.  Our recommendation is to generate revenue through changing the tax relief.  I will conclude as I know we are short on time.  We welcome any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shana Cohen"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cohen.

I agree completely on the revenue-raising exercises they are talking about.  It might be worth elaborating on the logic of how they came to their proposals.  It is not talked about much by the Government or the main Opposition party or even some of the think tanks.  They talk about prudence, sticking to the rules and not overheating the economy.  What is completely left out of the debate most of the time is the need for and viability of increasing the fiscal space through raising extra taxes on sectors that could actually afford it.  That could involve the tax reliefs and expenditures currently going to big business and the very wealthy or the fact that higher incomes could be taxed more without taxing those people out of existence.  It is great that the witnesses raised those points.  Do they not think that we could be a bit more ambitious in that regard?<\/p> <p>  We need a lot of money to go into public housing.  Dr. Healy is right to say that.  The list is 144,000 if we include people on housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, transfer lists.  If we do not have a housing programme that aims to get close to building that amount of housing, we are not going to solve the problem.  Should we not be more ambitious in our revenue-raising efforts?  Why stick at 6% for the minimum effective corporate tax rate?  Our current rate of 12.5% is low by international standards and, as we all know, nowhere near that is actually paid.  It is currently more like 2% or 4%, so why only go to 6%?  Why not set a minimum effective rate at 12.5%?  Fianna F&aacute;il will definitely scoff at that.<\/p> <p>  On the higher incomes, we should have one band over &euro;120,000 according to TASC's proposal.  Why not more?  I honestly ask if anybody really needs an income of &euro;200,000 to &euro;500,000.  To my mind, we should have a much more steeply progressive tax system.  There was a time, going back to the 1950s and 1960s, when very high incomes had punitive tax.  I think a Labour politician once said he would tax them until the pips squeak.  Why not be more ambitious in that regard?  Have the witnesses any comment on financial transaction taxes?  It is a big area in which I think we could raise extra revenue.  <\/p> <p>  On housing, there is quite a bit of debate on what the hold-up is at the moment.  I would say it is that on public land, the Government is in insisting on a mixture of social and affordable housing yet it refuses to define affordable housing, which means no schemes can get going because nobody knows the official position on affordability.  That thinking is based on the idea that we have got to have mixed tenures but now it is becoming a reason for nothing happening.  I believe there is a stigma attached to building public, social housing.  That has been the excuse for the various public private partnerships, PPPs, selling off bits of public land, mixed tenure and all that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#Q00100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>As to whether we could be a bit more ambitious on the total tax take, we are being fairly ambitious with the total we are proposing.  It moves us closer to the European average although we would still be below it.  As to why a 6% minimum effective corporate tax rate, we see that as a <i>pro tem<\/i>item.  Our view is that the European Union is moving towards a consolidated situation with regard to corporate tax and that we are likely to head towards a corporate tax rate of 17.5%, much as that might hurt everybody in the Irish political system.  Through all the crashes and everything else, the one thing they would never give way on was the 12.5%.  It is a kind of icon.  I think it will eventually be 17.5% and then I would put the minimum effective corporate tax rate at 10% or 12.5% - we could argue about that.  There should be a minimum effective corporate tax rate.  If it was put at 6%, it would bring in an additional &euro;1 billion.  That is an extraordinary amount.  It would come from a relatively small number of sources that are currently paying 1% and 2% by their own admission.<br\/><br\/>We have not suggested any increase in income tax because we do not believe it is necessary.  We are very positive about the financial transaction tax.  We did a lot of the research that is behind the proposals for the Irish Government to take it on board.  We have not included it here simply because we need to implement it jointly with eight or ten European countries of substance.  There are about ten European countries interested in doing this and it will be much easier once Brexit has taken place, whatever kind of Brexit we have.  The main resistance to it in the European Union has been from the UK.  France and Germany were positive about it.  <br\/><br\/>On the other tax issues, we have suggested things like applying standard rating to those non-pension discretionary tax breaks that cost more than &euro;10 million a year.  That would yield &euro;480 million in 2019.  That is a very substantial source.  Another suggestion is to remove the tax refund element for unused research and development tax credits.  We consider the capacity for corporations to pick up unused tax credits to be really scandalous.  There is &euro;168 million in that space.  We are all in favour of giving the research and development tax credit but one should not get it unless one puts the money in.  There is an issue there.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked what we think is the hold-up on the housing question.  I think there is almost an ideological resistance to public builds.  It seems to me that it has to be done by the private sector in some way or other, according to the Government.  As for the resistance to doing work at local authority level, my opinion comes from discussing the housing issues with local authority officials, who believe all of that is going to be taken away from local authorities in the same way that they saw water being taken away.  They do not want to put in a big investment and make a big effort and then see it all gone.  They are saying to the Government that if it is going to take it, it should take it.  The Government does not seem to be ready to take it.<br\/><br\/>I agree with the comment made in the previous session that we need a housing agency of substance.  We ourselves have made some very concrete proposals, including the first serious effort at designing a cost rental system that would allow the public and private sectors plus housing associations and other stakeholders to work together.  We have made a very serious effort at putting together a proposal that would not be negatively addressed by the fiscal rules, in other words, the Government would not have a veto on the thing.<\/p><p>That would mean in effect that the money would not automatically all go on to the Government's balance sheet because it would be run as a company.  I would see NGOs, the private sector and housing associations involved in it, as well as the Government because the State has much to offer in that space too.  There is much that can be done in housing.  The failure to deal with what is happening is a scandal because of the fact that supply is not keeping pace in any way with demand.  We need to crack this.  I have no problem with radical different ideas about how to do it.  It just needs to be done.  It will cost us money and we have to be prepared to invest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>On the question of why we are not more ambitious, TASC, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, decided to focus on areas which we have been researching over the past year, namely, childcare and social housing, as well as health.

There are many ways to raise revenues to fund social programmes.  We decided to advocate the things we did because they are pretty uncontroversial.  On the issue of pensions, as Dr. Cohen mentioned, most of the subsidies go to the already better-off.  The ESRI analysis showed it would raise around &euro;1 billion.  Similarly, on the top rate of income tax at 43%, those figures come from Revenue.

I am not surprised people think we are a tax haven and we get all of this bad press as a result.  There is an issue with that.<\/p> <p>  On diesel and petrol duty, we made a mistake because we believed what we were told about diesel being more sustainable and environmentally friendly.  In turn, we then created this space between the cost of diesel and the cost of petrol.  We are saying this needs to be rebalanced.  We need to increase diesel duty by six cent per litre and reduce petrol by six cent a litre and bring them together.  A commercial diesel rebate scheme of five cent a litre should also be put in place because so much of the transport of goods and so forth is diesel powered.  There is a hit involved but it is of a scale which is doable without causing significant problems.<\/p> <p>  We make an argument that the basic tax credits that PAYE workers get should be made refundable.  In other words, people should benefit from the full value of them if they do not currently do so.  That is an initiative which should be targeted only at the low paid.  We have 100,000 people in poverty who have jobs.  That grouping needs to be targeted.  It is a straightforward way of actually putting a fair bit of money in that direction.<\/p> <p>  In the earlier session, there was a large focus on auto-enrolment and pensions.  I see that as little more than a mechanism for putting more money into the private pensions industry.  We need a public pension scheme.  We have a contributory and non-contributory pension.  Many people do not get the full contributory pension because they did not make enough contributions or get enough credits in their work life.  We suggest turning the old age pension into a universal State pension, paid at contributory old age pension rate.  Most of the funding would come from standard-rating the pension break.  TASC and ourselves suggested this should be eliminated because it is a targeted at the top 20% who are the real beneficiaries of that.  The pension should be turned into a universal pension with no gaps and no people falling through it.  That would be a much better investment in pension policy.<\/p><p>Subsequently I would be quite happy to see the Government develop funds that people could invest in against their pension or to build up a private pension.

At our full year results in February we showed progress across a number of key areas.  We had an adjusted operating profit of &euro;109 million.  There was an operating loss of &euro;151 million, which reflected conduct and loan sale provisions we took at year end.

Consistent with the industry-wide regulatory requirement to reduce non-performing loans, we included an impairment provision in our 2017 results to allow for potential sales of loan portfolios that are in long-term arrears.  This difficult decision comes a decade after the financial crisis began and the continued extension of forbearance cannot be maintained.  Not all mortgages are sustainable and we are obliged to reduce the level of non-performing loans on our balance sheet.<\/p><p>For mortgages that are not sustainable, additional forbearance will not bring them back to a performing position.  The portfolio for sale that we have announced comprises Republic of Ireland mortgages, split into approximately 45% buy-to-lets, BTL, and 55% personal dwelling house, PDHs, by value.  The face value of the loans is currently &euro;1.6 billion, but that will continue to change as we move towards completion of a sale, and engage with customers as part of that process as well.<br\/><br\/>Table 1.1 breaks down the loan portfolio.  There are 3,600 PDHs and 2,900 BTL accounts in that, worth &euro;900 million and &euro;700 million, respectively.  The average arrears of customers in PDHs is &euro;52,000, while for BTL customers the average is &euro;31,000.  The average missed payments in the PDH category is 43 and, for BTL, it is 15.  The average number of forbearance arrangements that a customer has been in is three for PDHs and three for BTLs.  The average number of months spent in arrears is 44 for PDHs and 45 for BTLs.  <br\/><br\/>In the PDH category, some 73% first went into arrears between seven and nine years ago, and all are currently in arrears.  In the BTL category, 75% have been in arrears for more than 12 months during their lifetime.  It is worth noting that the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank made the following comments recently on loan sales: <\/p><blockquote>[On the impact of non-performing loans on the economy] the continued high level of non-performing loans makes banks highly vulnerable to future economic downturns, from both the existing non-performing loans, and potentially new defaults.  While all the Irish retail banks are significantly better capitalised than pre-2008, they are more vulnerable than those without this legacy to future economic shocks.&rdquo; <\/blockquote><p>In this context, the Central Bank also noted: &quot;Portfolio sales are a legitimate and necessary approach for banks to use to address non-performing mortgage loans.&quot; <br\/><br\/>I will briefly cover the tracker mortgage examination, as we will go into more detail later.  Of the 3,490 customers identified in our phase 2 report, we remediated 2,500 by the end of quarter one 2018, in line with our commitments.  We will meet the deadline for remediation for the vast majority of the remaining customers in this group by the end of June, with a small number completed in July as they require manual calculations and, therefore, additional levels of assurance.  There will be an exception for approximately 100 additional customers whom we have as yet unable to locate, despite our best efforts.  Every effort is being made in that respect.<br\/><br\/>Following a further file review, we confirmed in April 2018 that up to 2,000 additional customers are impacted by the examination.  The exact number is subject to completion of the bank's internal file review process and assurance by the external, independent third party, KPMG.  The majority of these customers retained their tracker mortgage but because of various different administration errors were on wrong rates.  The remediation payments will be of a significantly smaller magnitude than for those customers who should have been on a tracker rate but were on another product types.  We are currently working to correct the rates of these newly identified customers, and this will be complete by the end of quarter three 2018.  We expect to substantially progress the redress and compensation payments to these customers by the end of quarter three, with all of these customers to be completed in quarter four.<br\/><br\/>While we are working to conclude the remediation phase of the examination by year end, the appeals process will be available to customers beyond that point and for 12 months following receipt of remediation.  We fully acknowledge the time it has taken to put this right for customers and apologise unreservedly for it. <br\/><br\/>On business lending interest rates, we have been conducting a review of business practices, processes and customer journeys with a view to ensuring that any legacy issues are put right for customers.  As part of that review we have identified inconsistencies in documentation relating to 18,000 commercial loan accounts.  In summary, in March 2012, the bank advised customers via letter and in the national media that it was changing its definition of &quot;cost of funds&quot;, a variable component of the interest rate charged on their accounts.  At the time we believed the documentation applied to every account and that it allowed for this change.  However, in conducting our review, we have since identified that the facility documentation of these 18,000 customer accounts potentially did not allow for this change in definition and they were, therefore, overcharged.  The overcharge is less than 0.3% per annum over the lifetime of the overcharge, and the average refund due is less than &euro;2,000.  However, the amount of overcharge will vary depending on the time a loan has been outstanding, and the amount of the loan itself.<\/p><p>The calculation of the overcharged interest is a complex exercise, but we expect to complete remediation for the majority of customers by the end of 2018, with the most complex cases completed by quarter one 2019.  Customers are not required to take any action; we will write to all impacted customers and provide remediation in due course.  Should customers have any queries, we have a dedicated customer helpline and team in place to respond to queries from customers which is available on our website.<\/p><p> With regards to GRG, we have provided the committee with detail on this issue previously.  I would like to emphasise that there are a number of avenues open to customers who believe that they were treated unfairly in any way.  This involves the normal complaints process of the bank and a separate independent process.  We would encourage any customers with concerns about their treatment in GRG during the relevant period, including any matters relating to Republic of Ireland banking regulations at the time, to get in touch with our helpdesk, details of which can be found on our website.  Following a review of customer files to establish whether they were charged complex fees - an issue which has occurred within GRG - Ulster Bank identified 17 customers eligible for a refund of the complex fees they paid to us.  We have also received 63 complaints and these are being assessed through our complaints process. <\/p><p> On the recent customer transaction issue, on 24 April customers reported that debit and credit transactions with a date of Monday 23 April were no longer showing on their accounts.  These transactions had previously been visible from 6 p.m. on 20 April onwards.  We will speak about this in more detail during the rest of the session, but to clarify, this issue occurred as a result of human error and was not related to an IT systems failure.  The affected accounts were unfortunately impacted for 24 hours.  While working to resolve the matter as quickly as possible, we put in place support for our customers, making emergency cash available in our branches or via telephone.  The next priority for us was to ensure that all impacted customers were remediated as quickly as possible.  To ensure no customer was left out of pocket due to this event, we refunded all fees and charges applied on all customer accounts for the day the issue occurred. <\/p><p> On our retail transformation programme, over the last few years we have seen huge change in the way our customers are choosing to do their banking.  We are seeing more and more customers using online and mobile applications for day to day banking as opposed to the more traditional branch-based transactions.  All of this behaviour is driven by the desire for quick and convenient access, when and where customers want it.  Importantly, we expect this type of change to continue.  That is not to say that branches and counter service do not have a role to play.  They remain an important part of our customer service offering and approach, which is why we are taking the opportunity to invest in an improved look and feel in our network.  While we are not closing branches in 2018, as I have previously indicated, this remains under constant review.  <\/p><p> On mortgages and mortgage products, we launched our First Five mortgage campaign with a range of benefits tailored to meet the specific and practical needs of first-time buyers.  It offers five key benefits, including &euro;25,000 life insurance cover at no cost to the customer; 50% off home insurance so that customers have the right level of cover to protect their home and family; low fixed rates from 2.85%; a &euro;1,500 contribution towards legal fees; and free valuations.  We have also reduced the rates on a number of our fixed rate mortgage products, offering the lowest rate in the market, at 2.5%; simplified our mortgage loyalty offering; and, increased the interest rate on our one year fixed term deposit account.   <\/p><p> We remain committed to our ambition to serve our customers and attract new ones by becoming number one in customer service, trust and advocacy.  Reflecting the ongoing Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, commitment to Ulster Bank and the work we have done to strengthen our business, Standard &amp;amp; Poor's upgraded its long-term credit rating for Ulster Bank to BBB+ or positive outlook.  This follows the recent affirmation by the other credit ratings agencies, including Fitch's credit rating at BBB with the outlook revised to positive on 18 May, and Moody's upgrade to BAA1 or stable outlook on 1 May.  All three major credit ratings agencies have taken positive action, reflecting the progress we are making on our strategic priorities, particularly the strength, sustainability and the simplification of the bank and supporting our growth.  We also reached an important milestone in building a more sustainable bank, raising &euro;1 billion from a recent sale of mortgage-backed bonds which will provide more funding to lend in to the Irish economy.  Our focus remains on ensuring that Ulster Bank is best positioned to compete and grow for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, while seeking to regain customer trust by addressing and learning from the mistakes we have made in the past.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I look forward to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Stanley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529411400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Rather than allow this to continue through the meeting, I want to draw Mr. Stanley's attention to the fact that despite what he says about the tracker mortgages and how Ulster Bank is dealing with them, we have substantial correspondence indicating that customers have not been dealt with.

I am not saying that I feel sorry for Mr. Stanley, but what he has been describing to us is a fairly sorry tale.  The Chair pointed out what would otherwise have been my first point.  I have more than ten different items of correspondence that were sent to all members via the generic email address for the Joint Committee for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Those who wrote the correspondence say they have received 60-day holding letters, that their experience has been very frustrating and they want to know the bank's stance on former First Active customers.  They also provide updates on their own situations, saying that they have been given certain amounts of compensation but are very unsatisfied with the response.  They refer to loopholes affecting people who have gone to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO, and come back to Ulster Bank.  Can I get a commitment from the witnesses that each of these items of correspondence will be examined and responded to directly by someone on their team, with feedback forwarded to the committee?

I can give some context.  As the Senator might imagine, we are constantly updating and upgrading our systems across RBS and Ulster Bank.  We typically tend to do it over the course of a weekend.  The weekend preceding this customer issue, a change was made in RBS in the UK that was specifically for the UK.  It was linked to a regulatory change there that was different from our regulatory environment.<\/p><p>The change was confined to the UK.  A UK operator was involved in the change over the weekend.  There is a schedule of events that take place over the two or three days or the over the course of the weekend.  At one point, in that change over the weekend, the operator made a genuine human error that inadvertently impacted Ulster Bank.  I shall explain the error to the committee in order to help members understand what happened.  The operator, even though he or she should not have done so, inadvertently took down a part of the process within Ulster Bank that transmits files in our overnight batch system.  I am happy to answer follow-on questions on that point but I shall keep it at this level for now.  The operator inadvertently took it down but did not re-enable it properly.  Due to that specific act an issue unfolded from early morning on Tuesday, 24 April.  As Mr. Stanley has said, once we became aware of the issue our priority was to respond as quickly as possibly but first we tried to understand the problem.  As one can imagine, the environment is complex so one must first understand the extent of the issue.  All of our other systems, such as branch and mobile systems, behaved normally that morning.  We quickly set about understanding and containing the problem.  Once we had done so we knew what we had to do to fix the problem over the course of that evening.  We discussed whether to fix it intraday, during the business day, or fix it overnight.  Again, I am happy to explain all of that to the Senator.  <\/p><p> I want to clearly point out the following to the committee and our customers.  It is totally unacceptable that this happened.  I understand the impact it had on our customers and their concern about balances being moved.  My friends and family asked me what happened so I genuinely understand the matter.  I am sorry that this incident happened to our customers.  I thank our staff who are located up and down the country in various branches, telephony centres and business centres who worked diligently to deal with the issue over the course of 24 hours. <\/p><p> We set about resolving the issue and resolved it that night.  As the Senator would expect, we commenced a review subsequently.  The review is ongoing because we want to thoroughly examine this matter.  We have put in place specific controls that will ensure that if such an error occurs in the future it will be caught, or we would be alerted to same, before it had an impact on our customers.  <\/p><p> I shall pause there, if that is okay.

The bank should have realised that were it to carry on what it was doing, its actions would be illegal and would amount to overcharging by approximately &euro;36 million, or &euro;2,000 from each customer on average, without a contractual right to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061900002#N02000","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529411400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>We acknowledge that was clearly a mistake; we should not have done it.

By way of understanding, 1 May is a bank holiday across Europe, or at least in most countries across Europe.  Since the Single Euro Payments Area was brought into place in 2013 or 2014, any payments have to go via the European Banking Authority, EBA.  For example if I was to transfer money from bank A to bank B, from Galway to Limerick or from Mayo to somewhere else in the country, the payment would go to the clearing system and come back in.  That is the way it operates.  The European clearing system was not operating that day.  Any inter-bank payments were delayed by a day - direct debits, mortgages, etc.  <\/p><p> I believe the Deputy is referring to the fact that on that day there was a problem on one of our specific channels.  It did not arise on all of our payment systems, to be clear.  There was a problem on the mobile app that day, which arose if an Ulster Bank customer made a payment transfer between Ulster Bank accounts on that app - not a mortgage transfer, but a transfer from one account to the other.  The app was behaving in the same way for intra-Ulster Bank transfers as it was for inter-bank transfers, if that makes sense.  Clearly, that should not happen.  It should not behave that way.  That issue arose specifically on 1 May, specifically on the mobile app.  All the other channels, including branches, Internet banking and telephony, were all behaving in the way one would expect. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061900002#O02600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529411400,"counter":532,"content":"<p>If a customer had a direct debit going from an Ulster Bank account to another bank, for example an AIB account, to pay their mortgage on 1 May, did that go through?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061900002#P00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529411400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>It would not have gone through.

In his opening remarks, Mr. Stanley said that in the context of the resolution of these issues that it is essential for customers to build trust with the bank.  However, a sample of emails that I received since the last time Mr. Stanley was before us paints a different picture.  Ulster Bank customers are telling the bank that its helpline is helpless and that despite communicating with the bank on numerous occasions, they are being told the same thing, namely, that the review is ongoing and that the bank will be in contact with them in due course.  Some customers believe that it may be the end of September 2018 before they are contacted.  The bank did wrong; customers are trying to work with it but they are not getting the sense that the bank is working with them.<\/p> <p>  In another example, Ulster Bank compensated a customer at Christmas time in 2017 but immediately went back to accruing charges in the old way in 2018.  That case has still not been resolved.  In another case, a customer went through a process within the bank whereby the original terms of a contract were changed, in terms of what was being offered now, and the bank refused to budge.  My point is that the language that Ulster Bank customers are using to describe the bank paints a picture of an organisation that is dealing with these issues only reluctantly.<\/p><p>Last August this person was notified that they were impacted.  The bank had previously told this customer they were not impacted.  Since their initial correspondence they have not had a single contact from the bank despite them ringing the bank and trying to make contact with it.<\/p><p> Another person tells us that in July 2017 they were told things would be resolved and the bank would be in contact with them in a few months regarding redress and compensation.  Eleven months on and there has still been no update from the bank.  They are not an appending cohort to be examined; they have obviously been examined.  The list goes on and on.<\/p><p> Another woman has been waiting since 2016.  They were told this week that they would not even know if they were impacted until the end of September.

The person thought a deal was done only to find out that was not the case.  That is typical of banks, not just Ulster Bank.  He allowed a person onto his premises to do a structural survey for what he thought was to be a loan and the sale of the property to him, only to find out that in fact, a valuation of the property was being conducted.  It was not a survey at all, it was a valuation.  The day before Christmas Eve in a particular year he was advised that the building had been acquired by a vulture fund, even though the individual believed he was in negotiations with the bank.  He said the receivers and vulture funds are being allowed to rape and plunder decent, hard-working Irish companies that had no hand, act or part in the collapse of the Irish economy.  That is the experience of one particular individual.  He also pointed out that an offer to purchase was recommended for acceptance within the bank.  He said the main reason for time dragging on was caused by the banks and, lo and behold, the next thing he was told was the property had been sold to a vulture fund.<\/p> <p>  The same thing happened with a client about whom I spoke to Mr. Stanley at one of the previous meetings.  He had two buy-to-let properties and the rent from them was going to fund his home.  The bank knew it.  That was part of the deal that was done but the bank sold the buy-to-lets.  The minute the bank did that it was game over for the person.  Those are the types of stories about actions by the bank that cause me to believe that the underlying culture within the banks has not changed.  I would like more evidence through this committee in order to reflect on it and understand where the bank is going.  Between the GRG, business loans and so on, the banks collectively have ruined families and businesses in this country.  The banks can say sorry all they like but the evidence exists that they have entered into interactions with customers that have led them nowhere but disaster.<\/p><p>That is just unforgivable, in particular when I think of the amount of taxpayers' money that went into banks.  I have not changed my mind.  I am trying to be fair to Mr. Stanley but I find it shocking that that culture is still there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061900002#BB02300","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529411400,"counter":813,"content":"<p>As you have done already, Chairman, if you have individual cases you need to come to me about, please do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061900002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Stanley"},{"type":"speech","time":1529411400,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061900002#CC00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529411400,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I will do my utmost to get those sorted.<\/p> <p>  In terms of culture, the Central Bank has completed a culture review of the banks and that will feed its way back to the Minister so the committee will get some indication of it.

I am very pleased to meet the committee members.  I had met some of them previously, but it is an opportunity since my appointment as Secretary General in October 2016 and I look forward to our discussion.  I would like to introduce my accompanying colleagues all of whom are members of the management board.  Ms Breda Power looks after commerce consumer and competition, which covers many of the Department's regulatory agencies.  Mr. Dermot Mulligan is the assistant secretary looking after the investment and innovation division, covering the foreign direct investment side, and the science and innovation side.  Mr. David Hegarty covers the strategic policy division which encompasses the Action Plan for Jobs for the Department.  The management board is relatively small.  We are missing three other colleagues who are away on business at the moment.  They cover Brexit, trade, workplace relations and indigenous industry.<\/p> <p>  Our previous statement of strategy, which covered the period 2016 to 2019, was only published in January 2017.  However, a new statement of strategy was required, under the Public Service Management Act, following the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  This gave us an opportunity to revisit and update our current strategy which was published in April 2018.<\/p> <p>  The Department, with six offices and eight agencies and working closely with the local enterprise offices and InterTradeIreland, has a broad remit across a wide range of areas of responsibility.  Our strategy summarises the outcomes to which we aspire and actions we hope to deliver under a number of broad goals.  I have appended to my statement a list of the offices and agencies of the Department.<\/p> <p>  Our job is to support the Minister, Government, Parliament and the many stakeholders we represent, both nationally and internationally.  I tend to think the work of the Department can be understood as comprising three main areas: enterprise; regulation; and workplace relations.  That is pretty much everything that impacts on companies in Ireland and working abroad.  We also have a significant international role, particularly regarding trade.<\/p> <p>  The work of the Department is structured across six divisions: indigenous enterprise development division; innovation and investment division; EU affairs, trade policy and licensing division; commerce, consumer and competition division; workplace regulation and economic migration division; and strategic policy division.  Each division is led by an assistant secretary and we meet weekly as a management board to oversee and monitor our progress.<\/p> <p>  The statement of strategy sets out seven goals.  I can summarise them as: facilitating our indigenous enterprises to grow, innovate and deepen export opportunities across all regions of the country and internationally; ensuring that we maintain a pipeline of foreign direct investment with particular emphasis on securing investment across all regions of the country; working with colleagues across all Departments to improve the competitiveness and productivity of the economy; promoting innovation and growth through investment in research and development; ensuring that our regulation facilitates business investment and development, competition in the marketplace, high standards of consumer protection and corporate governance; and safeguarding workers&rsquo; rights and facilitating a positive industrial relations environment, with well-functioning dispute-resolution mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  Our strategy aims to ensure that we build on the very strong progress achieved in recent years and sets a vision of making Ireland the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable full employment and higher standards of living across all regions of the country.<\/p> <p>  We acknowledge the increasing complexity in the global economic environment in which the Department, its offices and agencies operate and the international challenges that face us.  Economic uncertainty remains high and we have placed a heightened emphasis on ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are strongly represented and robustly defended in international forums.  It is also vital that we work to ensure that enterprise policy and other relevant policy areas, many of which fall in the remit of other Departments, are oriented towards achieving a strong and innovative enterprise sector, sustaining competitiveness and promoting our resilience in the face of challenge.<\/p> <p>  The decision of the UK to leave the EU and the related global trade uncertainty present immediate and significant challenges for Irish business and for all aspects of the Department&rsquo;s remit.  On this we work closely with colleagues in the EU and the World Trade Organization.  The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will have short-, medium- and long-term implications across a range of policy areas.  It represents a particular risk to some of our enterprise sectors.  In many cases, these sectors are particularly labour intensive, have lower profit margins and have a strong regional footprint.  Agriculture is a classic example.  This will require varied responses from the Department and our offices and agencies at a policy and an operational level.  Our strategy is to ensure the continued growth and resilience of enterprises post-Brexit by supporting companies to compete, innovate and diversify trade, and by working to ensure that we support Government to get the best possible outcome.<\/p> <p>  Our statement of strategy is underpinned by a number of other key strategies and frameworks.  These include Enterprise 2025 Renewed, which we revisited and renewed this year in light of global challenges; our annual Action Plan for Jobs, which was recently adopted by Government; and Innovation 2020, which outlines how we plan to move towards Ireland becoming a global innovation leader, driving a strong, sustainable, high-employment economy and a better society.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, many of our policies are dependent on working closely with colleagues in other Departments.  Some of the policy issues that particularly impact on the enterprise agenda, for example, tax, finance, skills, infrastructure, energy and climate change, are the responsibility of other Departments.  We work in an outward focused way and we work hard on ensuring a collaborative relationship and ongoing engagement with other all stakeholders at EU level and nationally here at home, helping us to deliver on our goals.<\/p> <p>  Our new statement of strategy reflects that a small number of functions have transferred from our Department to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, mainly in the areas of employment rights policy and related legislation, with effect from 1 September 2017.  It also reflects that we have now taken over responsibility and leadership for co-ordinating the Digital Single Market strategy from the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>  Throughout the statement of strategy, we have identified clear outcomes and we are committed to working collaboratively with others to achieve those outcomes.  Our annual business plans in the coming years are very much focused on the commitments we have outlined.  As a management board, we work collectively to monitor and review that statement of strategy.<\/p> <p>  I have been in the Department for just 18 months.  I am very proud of the team that I lead.  I have worked in six different Departments in my time.  I am very confident the committed and talented team we have, working with all our colleagues in the offices and agencies, will ensure that we deliver on the ambitious goals set out in the strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":836,"content":"<p>We will now take questions.

The Department is new to me, in terms of my role as spokesperson for my party.  I will start by making a few observations.<\/p> <p>  This country is now in a different economic cycle than heretofore and so too is the Department in terms of how it looks at the horizon and beyond.  Various Departments oversee competitiveness and the key ingredients of skillsets, training and innovation.  Their job is to ensure that we remain competitive and observe all of these disparate policies.  That is my observation and is not meant as a criticism.  Let us bear in mind that we all get up in the morning with a desire to do our best but sometimes Departments can become siloed.  That can happen within a Department and between Departments.  For that reason, I instance the skills, the skillsets and skill shortages that are very evident across the economy, primarily in trades, crafts and the wet trades in the construction sector.  Work permits have been allocated in recent times for the agricultural sector and the transport sector faces a potential crisis.  I do not use the words \"crisis\" and \"shortages\" lightly.  Problems in the construction and transport sectors will quickly lead to very serious competitive problems.<\/p> <p>  The Secretary General has said that foreign direct investment falls within the remit of her Department.  Amazon has announced that 1,000 additional jobs will be created over the next two years, and mostly in Dublin.  These people will have to live somewhere.  If we are serious about accepting that we are part of a globalised economy, and our competitors are from within the European Union and, possibly, from 29 March of next year, a third country located quite near to us will draw from the same labour pool.  In other words, people from the European Union who work in the UK may no longer be able to work in the UK and we also have a common travel area.  Therefore, Ireland could easily be seen as a place to find skillsets.  Our labour market could compete with the UK labour market in the areas of construction, agriculture and in all areas of the economy, including health and education.  Have we considered the matter in the context of Brexit?<\/p> <p>  I presume that the Department is Brexit proofing like every other Department.  I view a competitive labour market as a key area.  I realise that I have asked the Secretary General to analyse the potential impact of the unknown.  I assume that various strategies have been or are being put in place, depending on the outcome of Brexit.  One thing is for sure is that if we have a harsh Brexit on 29 March 2019 we will be on a cliff edge.  I mean a lot of European people will no longer be able to work in the UK and we have a common travel area.  Where will all of that leave our labour market?  The UK will have to resort to using our labour thus increasing wage costs.  Some people will benefit but such a situation may have a negative impact on the broader economy, particularly in terms of our competitiveness.  Such a situation will make us less attractive to foreign direct investors and, therefore, less able to sustain our economy.<\/p> <p>  People talk about a competitive economy and all that is required in a complex economy.  Our economy is very complex due to being so open and global due to its interdependence.  Skills and skillsets are part of the Department of Education and Skills yet, primarily, the impact of the failure or success by that Department is directly and more immediately seen in other areas like the construction sector and in the broader economy.  The strategy statement is a very bold document and we are good at writing documents in this country.  However, most of the details on how to implement the strategy fall outside the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in terms of the strategy's success or failure.  I ask the Secretary General to outline how she will ensure that the various Departments act in a cohesive fashion when it comes to implementing the strategy.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a final comment about consumer affairs.  I sometimes wonder whether we, as a country, are proactive enough or whether we depend too much on the European Union to nudge us when it comes to the protection of consumer affairs.  Can we be more proactive as people, as a Government and as a State, in terms of advancing consumer protection rights and entitlements?  Let us consider airlines and shipping companies.  In terms of the latter, recently as many as 19,000 families were badly discommoded.  Irish Ferries may not be directly at fault but it took the bookings and gave a guarantee to people that they could sail on certain dates.  I have been left to ponder the following matters.  Do we sometimes betray our own citizens by not having robust protection for consumers?  More often than not, we seem to depend on the European Union to encourage us to protect our own citizens when it comes to consumer rights.         <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#F00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I will reply to the questions and perhaps my colleagues can add to my replies.  As the Deputy said, there are a number of areas where we act as both partners and collaborates with other Departments but we do not necessarily hold the mandate.  On the skills side, in particular, we provide the secretariat to the expert group on future skills needs, which reports regularly on the what skills are needed by our economy.  I am a member of the national skills council chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Again, the council facilitates prioritisation across needs.  We have nine regional skills fora located across the country.  My Department is very involved with and is represented on each of those fora. <\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I work very hard with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills to make sure that we identify important areas.  We have a direct line, both ourselves and through our agencies, in terms of where skills are under pressure or under-resourced and we bring that expertise to the table.  Let us consider the roll out of the skills for growth programme by the Department of Education and Skills.  We would have been very involved in putting the spotlight on that work with our background.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, when we attend trade missions or deal with companies, a lot of emphasis is placed on people having to the correct set of skills.  We have found that there is only a shortage in a small number of sectors.  We are working very hard to resolve such shortages.  We conduct a lot of joined up work with institutes of technology through the Science Foundation Ireland and support and facilitate work in that area.  I do not feel that there is a lack of joined up thinking in that area and believe we are doing well.     <\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned work permits.  My Department review work permits and identify critical skills twice a year using a formal process.  We begin analysis by asking ourselves whether we can find the skills in Ireland and can we augment them.  We have heavily invested in new skills in some of the colleges.  Ireland will be the first country in the world to provide a masters course in artificial intelligence and we have new skills in digital aviation and right across the board.  I am sure the Deputy will be aware that we recently opened up the work permit system for agricultural workers, which relates more to low paid work where there is a labour shortage.  We are always very conscious of our own unemployed and inactive population, and that 18 million people are unemployed in the European Union.  That is our first port of call when trying to replace skills.<\/p><p>More broadly on infrastructure, there are clear challenges in housing.  There is a lot of policy in place and work coming on stream.  In terms of our competitors for investment, we are conscious that we are very comparable with other countries or cities such as Luxembourg, Brussels and Frankfurt, which experience similar issues to Ireland.  However, it is a challenge to the economy and we can feed in our elements and it is very important that we do so.<\/p><p> On the United Kingdom common travel area, CTA, people coming to work here will have to come within the CTA agreement and will not be competing as such.  The issue is more in regard to citizens of the United Kingdom. We are getting quite a lot of interest from such people, in particular those in the research community who would like to come and work in Ireland, especially those with EU backgrounds who may no longer feel as welcome in the UK as was previously the case.  It is an opportunity to strengthen our offering on the innovation and research sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":842,"content":"<p>If the UK no longer has a pool of labour available to it from the European Union and because we have a common travel area and could potentially still provide a pool of labour to the UK-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#G00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I apologise; I misunderstood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":844,"content":"<p>-----we could end up with a situation whereby the UK cherry-picks our pool of labour, including teachers, nurses and those with other skill sets.

I have a couple of questions.  Dr. Quinn mentioned that the Action Plan for Jobs falls under the remit of Mr. Hegarty.  The committee last year decided that it would travel around Ireland.  We have undertaken a significant body of work on the cost of doing business and have had many engagements with stakeholders including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, banks, Insurance Ireland, the Irish Farming Association, IFA, hoteliers, restaurant owners, shop owners and many others.  We undertook a huge body of work and will finalise and launch our document in July.  I am a Deputy who represents Waterford and was conscious that when the committee sits in Dublin, many of those who appear before it are Dublin-centric and more regional issues are not always addressed.  To compensate for that, the committee sat in Waterford to deal with issues relating to the Action Plan for Jobs.  The five county councils of the south east were represented by four cathaoirligh and a leas-chathaoirleach - one cathaoirleach was unavailable.  The south east is coming from a very low base and, for example, its unemployment rate is always stubbornly approximately 2% above the national average.  The area has not performed as well as many others.   Does Mr. Hegarty have cohesive plans to identify potentially underperforming areas, rather than those which are overperforming?  Is there a special focus in that regard?  I do not refer solely to my area but, rather, the country generally because although areas of Limerick and Cork are doing extremely well, many areas in all constituencies are not performing as well.  Is there a strategic focus on areas identified as not performing as well as others?<\/p> <p>  On the point made by Deputy Kelleher, the issues to the fore during our engagements on the cost of doing business were rates, insurance, the cost of finance and the lack of skills in the construction and food industries and, specifically, hotels and restaurants.  That came up a lot.<\/p> <p>  While it may not come under the remit of the witnesses, I was struck by the manner in which outside factors influence what happens in this country.  The collapse of Carillion led to the collapse of Sammon Contracting.  I wish to discuss smaller contractors, the small and medium enterprises which may only have one, two or three employees and may be a family firm.  Many smaller contractors are owed money by companies such as Sammon Contracting and Carillion but the chances of their receiving it are very slim.  A business person who provided painting services is owed &euro;58,000 and his company may not survive.  Is the Department focusing on such smaller contractors who may end up going to the wall because they are owed sums such as &euro;60,000 or &euro;100,000?<\/p><p>The witnesses understand the point I am making in that regard.  Is there a focus on that?<\/p><p> Finally, as far as I am aware, last year or the year before that the Department was focused on having data centres throughout Ireland and I believe it employed a company to examine that.  Is there any update on that?  It is important to the committee to see things moving outside the Dublin-centred area as well, and not just because we live in those areas.  There is an overheating and the other areas of the country can act as release valve in respect of housing and quality of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#G01000","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":852,"content":"<p>First, the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 at national level has a somewhat different emphasis from earlier action plans for jobs.  When the Action Plan for Jobs process was initiated in 2012, we were facing a national unemployment crisis with unemployment at approximately 16% of the labour force.  As you said, Chairman, the context has changed now.  That is reflected in the Action Plan for Jobs 2018, which has a stronger emphasis on the regional dimension.  In addition, it is important to point out that we have regional action plans for jobs with one for each of the eight NUTS 3 regions.  They are currently undergoing a refresh or reprioritisation and will be published towards the end of the year.  When we look at the employment performance of the economy overall, the picture is quite encouraging at regional level.  We have an overall target, and it is in the programme for Government, that each region would have an unemployment rate that is not more than 1% above the State average.  There are just two regions above that, the south-east region, which is your region, and the midlands.  However, both are within 2% of the national average so that is an encouraging trend.<\/p> <p>  In addition, employment growth has been fairly evenly spread across the country.  Four out of five jobs created in the year to the second quarter of 2017 were outside Dublin.  With regard to the performance of EI and IDA-supported companies, 65% of the jobs created in EI-supported companies last year were outside Dublin.  The Chairman asked if we have a focus on the problems of underperforming regions.  That is a key focus of the recently launched national development plan and the accompanying national spatial strategy.  They are about ensuring that growth is more evenly distributed across the different regions, with various investments in infrastructure to support that.<\/p> <p>  On the question of data centres, the Minister published a Government statement on data centres the week before last.  Some concerns have been expressed.  As data centres by their nature are energy intensive, they place a great deal of pressure on the grid.  The policy statement basically states the IDA will aim to prioritise the location of data centre at regional locations.<\/p> <p>  The Chair referred to the competitive issues with rates, the cost of insurance and the cost of finance.  When I was responding to Deputy Kelleher's questions earlier, I mentioned that those are the types of issues on which the National Competitiveness Council would focus.  She is correct that the cost of finance is a significant issue in Ireland.  It is higher than it is for our eurozone peers.  There are issues with rates and insurance as well.  Those issues are raised by the National Competitiveness Council, which is an independent body that reports to the Department.  As the reports of the National Competitiveness Council are brought to the Government, that ensures there is a focus on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1529420400,"counter":853,"content":"<p>My point is that it was probably the common denominator in all the presentations we received.

How often does the director or staff from the ODCE meet the Department or the witnesses?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on Brexit.  It is a difficult question because we do not know what the position is or what will happen and whether it will be a hard or soft Brexit.  It appears that the members of the Tory party have lost the run of themselves and that we are heading for a hard Brexit.  Do the witnesses share my concern about the low uptake of Brexit supports?  There are a number available.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question on this issue last week and it states that only 32 companies signed up to Enterprise Ireland's market discovery fund and there were only 110 Be Prepared grants since March 2017.  There were 277 InterTradeIreland's Start to Plan vouchers issued since June 2017.  There were no data available on the Brexit loans scheme.  What is happening with that?  It appears that 2,291 people have done Enterprise Ireland's Brexit scorecard since March 2017.  Are the witnesses concerned about the low uptake of the Brexit schemes?<\/p> <p>  My third question is about the Global Ireland initiative, which the Taoiseach raised in the D&aacute;il today.

We know that Brexit is coming down the tracks and is a threat.  However, my questions follow from questions such as that which Deputy Kelleher asked about our economy, how we react and the fact that every time we have reacted in the past, we did so from a position of weakness.  When the crash happened, we reacted.  Our competitiveness was being questioned in 2006 and 2007 in the context of wage inflation.  We took a hit in the multinational sector and then in construction, so it was a double whammy.  We have recovered and we are coming towards 5% unemployment which is very welcome.  We are now in a position of strength.  What is being put in place to see us through the likely threats in the next two to three or three to five years?  How will we keep our economy on edge?  How are we going to keep that edginess that has got us from 15% unemployment to 5%?  If we start resting on our laurels, we will be caught again.

Looking at global trade, issues such as tax and the United States have huge implications on the Irish economy.  We touched on skills, which is a major feature.  That is something  to which my colleagues might wish to add.  However, we must separate out what we can and cannot control.  We are takers of policy in certain areas.  For example, if there is a trade war between the EU and the US, we would be part of the EU discussion but our influence would be reduced than would be the case if the matter relate to a skills policy in respect of which we have a direct control and we could ensure that we invested in particular areas.  We tend to distinguish between the areas that we can absolutely control ourselves and matters in respect of which we are not policy takers but, rather, contributors to discussions.  The potential trade war is a big factor but we have also had huge investment from global trade.   New free trade agreements are coming through such as Mercosur, and those with Singapore and Japan.  Those will provide us with great opportunities.<\/p> <p>  Asia provides us with great potential.  I met 11 ambassadors from the region in Vietnam last month.  We sat down with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and had two days of planning for the Asia region and how to strengthen our presence there.  Some of it is described in the business footprint plan but much of it is about how we work well together.  When one travels in Asia, whether it is with Ministers or Deputies, doors open more easily, which is not the case in the United States.  We need different strategies for different regions.  We have an Asia strategy which we developed with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and which relates to growing Asia as a market.<\/p><p>Last year 300 companies went from Ireland to Singapore and Japan and many good contracts were established.  It was very positive.  An example I often give relates to our visit to the highest tower in Singapore.  The guy who was showing us the tower said the building is Singapore and the brains are Irish because all the electronics put into the tower came from Irish companies.  Sometimes we do not celebrate or know enough about the success of Irish companies abroad.  They are doing amazing work.  For us, it is about supporting them and giving them access.  Particularly in Asia, the trade missions work very strongly.  It is a question of supporting those concerned with the required skills sets and, as I mentioned, customs information and training.  It is a long game in Asia; it takes years to establish a presence and to get involved with companies.  That is what Enterprise Ireland is particularly excellent at doing.

It strikes me that for those involved in small or medium enterprises, Sparkasse banks would make a significant difference in some circumstances.  It is certainly relevant, but I take the point made.<\/p> <p>  I will talk about worker co-ops.  The Department stresses the importance of growing indigenous enterprises.  Worker co-ops account for a significant percentage of the economies of EU member states.  In Sweden they account for 13% of GNP; in Switzerland, 16%; and in Finland, a whopping 21%.  In recent years countries such as France, Italy and Spain have all moved to either introduce or strengthen their worker co-operative legislation.  It seems to be an area that has been neglected.  It is one at which the committee is hoping to look later in the year.  I have a number of questions about the issue.  What emphasis is the Department placing on the development of co-operatives, in particular worker co-operatives?  Does it intend to introduce legislation to recognise worker co-operatives as a distinct legal entity?  What knowledge is available within Enterprise Ireland of worker co-operatives?  Is it a form of enterprise that is being promoted in the Department?

The work permit programme for the fisheries sector was disgracefully run.  Two weeks ago the International Transport Workers Federation told us that one in ten workers issued with a permit had been the victim of international human trafficking, which is the most serious of charges.  It is absolutely horrific.

That review is due to be completed by the end of June.  In the interim, because there was such pressure on the agriculture sector, we looked specifically at horticulture, meat processing and the dairy sector.  The Minister made a change to the employment permit regulations to allow the agrifood sector to source workers from outside the European Union.  There were 500 permits for horticultural workers, 250 for meat processor operatives and 50 for dairy farming.  It was done on a pilot basis on the basis of a lot of interaction with the agriculture sector and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and using the evidence they provided for us.  The amendment to the regulations introduced a new minimum remuneration threshold of &euro;22,000 which was below the threshold for the normal permit but above the national minimum wage.  We also required a commitment from employers that permit-holders would have access to suitable accommodation and training, including language training.  We said we would look at the permit quotas again and allowing them to be retained if there was investment in innovative technologies.  It is a tricky area because, on the one hand, we want to maintain the quality of the workforce and, on the other, we have sectors that are demanding labour.  It is different from the case in the fisheries sector which comes under a different permit scheme run by the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have inspected 95% of the fisheries sector from the workplace relations side.

I sit on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and it is always scheduled at the same time.  I try to bilocate and I have not figured out how to be in two places at once yet.<\/p> <p>  My first question is about Brexit.  I apologise if the witnesses have already dealt with some of these questions when I was not here.  I caught some of the end of their answers to a previous speaker about the Be Prepared grant.  It is anticipated that 100 or so businesses might sign up to that grant.  If everybody took the maximum of &euro;5,000, it would only amount to &euro;500,000.  In the context of how huge Brexit is, it is probably not a huge amount of financial support from the State to businesses.<\/p> <p>  I am spokesperson on Brexit for my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, so I have looked at this a little more.  There appears to be a genuine lack of preparedness across the board.  I accept what the witnesses are saying is that, until companies or individuals are faced with the impact of Brexit, there may be a reluctance to prepare because if one has limited finances and wants to hire an extra worker, spend money on marketing one's business or whatever, it is difficult to justify spending money on the unknown that may never happen.  The approach our Government is taking is not to prepare too much so there is not a self-fulfilling prophecy.  That attitude is permeating our business community.<\/p> <p>  The key sector that we all agree will probably be worst-hit is the agrifood sector.  That may affect the regions more than the cities.  I represent a rural constituency in Mayo.  Agrifood and agriculture is a huge employer in the constituency, as it is across the west of Ireland, and indeed nationally.  I am not saying that the west is more affected than the rest of the country.  Coming from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight earlier, a suggestion from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which was the first I had heard about it, was to have a Brexit adjustment assistance fund.  I asked what exactly that is and how it might work.  The thinking behind it was that if we know for a fact that we will lose employment or that there will be fewer jobs in a sector, we need to have money and supports in place to help these employees to retrain for a different sector, to get into different areas of employment and to help businesses diversify.  I would appreciate the witnesses' response about what we could do to put something in place to help to prepare workers for a possible reduction in job opportunities in a particular sector, specifically agrifood.<\/p> <p>  My local enterprise office, LEO, is very good.  It is fantastic to work with.  I often refer budding entrepreneurs or small businesses that are looking to expand to it.  It has had some brilliant success stories.  What do the witnesses see as being the role of the LEO in a post-Brexit world where we want to diversify and get into new markets?  How do they see the role of the LEO working with regard to regional investment and jobs?<\/p> <p>  To move away from Brexit slightly, an area which we need to do much more work on which goes across a number of Departments and not just the witnesses' own, is the female participation rate in the workforce.  It is an area where we can make huge progress to the benefit of our businesses and country.  We know that in Ireland, we are at approximately 67% participation.  We have a big gap that we can work towards closing.  A key barrier to women and indeed some men returning to work is childcare and its cost.  A second area that was highlighted more recently is the impact of the tax system on a second member of the family returning to work.  While it is not directly under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, it can work with other Departments to formulate a policy and strategy going forward to address this.  We know that women coming through second and third level reach the highest standards of qualifications and do well with third level qualifications.  We then lose many of them come childbearing age and they do not really make up the gap when they return to the workforce.  It is much more difficult.  Key areas that we need to look at are childcare and related supports, the tax system, maternity benefits and how that might be worked on.  I would be interested to see what the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is doing in that area.  How is it working towards increasing the participation of women in the workforce?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#M00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":931,"content":"<p>To touch on some of the areas, we talked about Brexit earlier but it was focused on how we assist companies.

It is brilliant to see those high-tech jobs coming to Ireland, but my immediate reaction was to wonder where these employees will live.  I listened to a vox pop on Radio 1 yesterday where people who were looking for housing were interviewed on the streets of Dublin.  The Amazon jobs announcement was mentioned, and one of those being interviewed spoke of having to start looking for housing quickly because this would create much more competition.  Some 200 jobs are being advertised immediately.  Housing is definitely a factor.<\/p> <p>  A new advance factory was constructed in Castlebar, County Mayo.  I am perhaps guilty of criticising the lack of IDA visits to my local town and constituency, although others are guilty of that as well.  Obviously no company can be forced to locate in a particular area; we can only showcase what we have.  The feedback we get from companies already located in the area is that the biggest challenges they face are infrastructure, the road network and communications, specifically broadband and mobile phone coverage.  One of our local, very successful factories is the Allergan factory in Westport.  I met the chief executive and some of the staff at the company who said Allergan loses some of its product during transport because the roads are so bad that it bangs off the inside of the truck.  That is amazing to think about.  The Westport factory competes with other divisions within Allergan internationally for specific contracts.  I was told it is difficult to compete if it is pointed out that 2% of product is lost in transport.  It would be helpful, to give a regional area any chance of competing, if the basic infrastructure was in place to enable a company to choose Mayo over Dublin or Donegal over Cork in order to balance development.  All Departments should be applying pressure to have infrastructure provided because such competition will not be possible without broadband and proper roads, which I consider to be tier one basic infrastructure.  While it is great to consider extensions to the DART, the Luas cross city and a second runway at Dublin Airport, we should first have the basics in place everywhere before moving on to what I consider to be tier two investment.  The Department is probably hearing this all the time.  I am sure it is trying to get companies to come and view our wonderful new facility that is lying empty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018061900002#N00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529420400,"counter":944,"content":"<p>We make those points right across Government, but we have a programme of visits in place.

The regional thrust of the plan is important as a support to enterprise in regional locations.
