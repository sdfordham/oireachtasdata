At the very least, they show a very poor sticking plaster is being applied.  There is a complete lack of transparency, substance and, most worryingly of all, credibility surrounding these figures.  There is a bogus, spurious element to some of them and, indeed, a clear statement in the correspondence that they will not translate into reality.  With all the talk of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, the crisis in accident and emergency services, overcrowding, and the bed capacity review, in essence these figures and the correspondence between the HSE and the Minister show that the health service will at the very best stand still if not face more cuts to vital services in 2018.  Given that the pay agreements will absorb the bulk of the increased expenditure, there will be little for additional services.  The elderly will continue to suffer, the disabled will still be shortchanged in respect of access to therapies and services, the acute hospitals will remain under intense pressure, notwithstanding the experiences of December and January, and primary and community care will remain neglected.<\/p><p>Specifically, according to the HSE's own internal assessment, there are &quot;long waiting lists&quot; in respect of gynaecology and &quot;poor access to treatment [has] left thousands of women with a poor quality of life&quot;.  Regarding anaesthesia, the HSE states that &quot;Serious clinical risk exists because [there is only] one line of anaesthetic call&quot; in most general hospitals and accident and emergency departments.  The HSE states that there is &quot;a national shortage of critical care beds&quot; which is &quot;impacting on access to scheduled and unscheduled care services&quot;.  Ophthalmology theatre closures and waiting lists are &quot;affecting preventable deterioration&quot;.  Urgent targets will be missed in endoscopy and colonoscopy.  There will be a staffing deficit in 2018 right across the spectrum of cancer care for child and adolescents and in geriatric oncology, radiation, surgical and medical services.  The correspondence goes into other specifics, such as the need for 80 beds and five theatres in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the dialysis unit in Galway and so on.<\/p><p>Most damning of all, the so-called value improvements or cost savings have not been identified and are extremely vague.  The chief executive is stating large tranches of these savings will be very difficult to realise and, if we read the language, will not be realised.<\/p> <p> Does the Taoiseach agree these Estimates lacked transparency in advance of the budget and have lacked it since and, in essence, they mask a deteriorating situation in the provision of services to our citizens in 2018?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516716300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Before calling the Taoiseach to respond, I ask Members to extend a warm welcome to our distinguished visitors, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr. Noble McNeely, who is accompanied by the Clerk of the General Assembly, Reverend Trevor Gribben, and our friend from Lucan, Reverend Trevor Morrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300004#B00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516716300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is important that when we discuss health budgets we put all of these things into their rightful context.  We have this year the largest budget for the HSE and the health sector in the history of the State, at approximately &euro;15 billion, an increase of &euro;2 billion a year in the past three years.  It is increasing much faster than the population is growing or ageing.  We are now one of the top five spenders on health in the world, if we divide the health budget by the number of citizens in the State, notwithstanding the fact we have a young population.  Even during the recession, our health spending <i>per capita<\/i>was above average, so this idea we are only catching up on underspending during the recession does not support the facts.<\/p><p>The fundamental problem and crisis that affects our health service, in my view, is not solely lack of money or lack of resources.  It is much more about how money is spent and how resources are deployed, and monetising all problems does not actually bring us any closer to a solution.  There will, of course, be more money and more staff for the health service this year.  We already have record numbers of doctors, almost 10,000, working in our public health service.  In terms of nurses per patient per head per bed, we are very near the top of the league table.  However, those extra staff and extra beds, and all of the extra money, will not make a difference unless we have better management, proper clinical leadership, real accountability and proper responsibility from those charged with running and managing our health service.  I absolutely accept it is the Government's responsibility to make all of this happen.<\/p><p>If we take the entire spend of the entire Government, we spend approximately &euro;60 billion a year.  In a sustainable way, the most any responsible Government can increase spending is by approximately 4% or 5% a year.  Anything more than this is unsustainable and we would be heading into another crisis quite soon.  The most we can increase spending is by &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion a year.  If we take all Government Departments and agencies together, they requested an extra &euro;12 billion this year.  Anyone will understand this is not sustainable.  It is the normal process in the course of events for Departments and State agencies to request much more than they anticipate they will achieve from the Estimates process.<\/p><p>What is unique about the HSE is it estimates it needs &euro;1.5 billion extra every year, that is an extra 10%, to do nothing to improve patient outcomes.  That is not sustainable.  If we are going to turn around our health service and make reforms and changes, and if we have any prospect of implementing reports such as the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the starting point cannot be a 10% increase in the budget, an extra &euro;1.5 billion a year, to do nothing in terms of improving outcomes for patients, improving patient experience or improving patient care.  It is not credible or sustainable, and I accept it needs to change, because we cannot have this continual exchange of letters where all problems are monetised and then just passed on.  We will need a lot of changes and a lot more accountability, and that will be driven by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300004#B00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516716300,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not answer the question.  My question went to the heart of an issue of credibility and honesty in presenting the figures and challenges facing the health service.  The Taoiseach has been commentating on the health service since he was Minister for Health, with little outcome.  In 2014 and 2015, I identified dishonesty in the health service Estimates process and in the way things were working and operating in the Department and the HSE.  Essentially, I am asking the Taoiseach whether the Estimate put before us in the national service plan, is acceptable.  Irrespective of all of those issues about which the Taoiseach has spoken, one cannot put figures that cannot be realised into an Estimate.<\/p><p>That is what the chief executive of the Health Service Executive, HSE, is telling the Government and the Oireachtas at this late stage, after the budget has been passed.  In essence, the indication is that there is potentially a deficit of &euro;800 million.  Leaving that aside, there is a figure of &euro;346 million<i><\/i>for efficiency savings or value improvement.  He is very clearly saying that the last element of that is almost beyond implementation in the figures.  Essentially, he is saying that delivery of the &euro;119 million in priority theme two, in addition to the &euro;77 million from priority theme one, will be extremely challenging.  We all know what that means; it means it is a false figure and it should not be in there.<br\/><br\/>Let us have an honest debate about this issue.  The Taoiseach should stop coming in and saying that the Government will implement Sl&aacute;intecare; it is not going to implement Sl&aacute;intecare or anything in Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is the honest answer.  Let us have an honest debate about the challenges facing health not just on funding, but on reforms.  Let us not camouflage, mask and pretend while putting a sticking plaster over the figures for another year.  That has been happening for the past four years.  The Government realised hundreds of millions of euro in other savings last year while getting additional tax and so on but it has also prioritised where that goes.  We want an honest debate on the figures not after the budget, but in advance of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300004#B00400","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516716900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I always welcome an honest debate and if we were to have an honest debate about health, one of the first elements the Deputy would accept is that it is not credible or sustainable to argue for an extra &euro;1.5 billion per year for health care on the basis of it making absolutely no difference, with no improvements for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300005#C00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516716900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We know that.

He knows that during his period in government, there were service plans that included efficiency criteria and percentages for efficiency.  There is nothing unusual about that.<\/p>  <p>  In more general terms, there will not be cuts to the health service in 2018.  The budget has increased and staffing levels have increased.  All problems will certainly not be solved but there will be action in a number of very important areas.  For example, there will be an increase in funding for home care, with an extra 75,000 hours for that care.  It is very real.  Surgical waiting lists have been falling for most of the past six months because of investment in elective hospitals and investment through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That will continue.  We are also adding more beds to the system, with 170 additional beds opening so far this winter across a number of hospitals.  I would be happy to list them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300005#C00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516716900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I especially welcome our visitors and it is good to see friendly faces.  The Taoiseach knows another round of talks to re-establish the political institutions will start tomorrow in Belfast.  This will be the fifth round of formal talks since the power-sharing arrangements collapsed a year ago.  There have also been numerous informal and private exchanges between Sinn F&eacute;in and the other parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party, mostly on Michelle O'Neill's initiative.  The institutions need to be re-established on the basis of equality and parity of esteem.  Thus far, the Democratic Unionist Party leadership has resisted this imperative, and there is no doubt elements of that leadership are encouraged by the pact it has with the Tory Government in London.<\/p>  <p>  Many people in the North were pleased with the Taoiseach's recent assertion that nationalists will never again be left behind by an Irish Government, so his recent remarks on Clare FM were very disappointing.  This type of negative commentary has long been the hallmark of statements about the North from leaders in the South.  These include the Taoiseach's predecessor and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, who along with others present the difficulties as the fault of two problem parties.  The Taoiseach should try to avoid that temptation.  Whatever effect this negative approach has in elections here, it is certainly of no assistance to the talks process in the North.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is well aware of the issues, which concern rights.  In essence, all the rights being denied to people at this time are rights available to everybody else on these islands.  In his Clare FM interview, the Taoiseach stated that Sinn F&eacute;in is incapable of negotiating and compromising in the North.  This begs the question for the Taoiseach as to what rights should be compromised.  Perhaps Gaelg&oacute;ir&iacute; should forget about an Irish language Act or gay and lesbian couples should forget about marriage equality or the bill of rights.  These are not the questions I am asking today.<\/p><p>Instead, I actively encourage the Taoiseach to continue to meet people in the North, outside the political parties, to get a deeper sense of what is happening there.<\/p> <p> I have recorded my concern about the toxic atmosphere that has shrouded political discourse in recent times.  However, I welcome the announcement this morning by the group describing itself as &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann that it has ended its armed actions.  I especially thank and commend the trade unionists and community leaders who were involved in securing this outcome.  Meaningful change can only be managed and advanced through exclusively peaceful means.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's commitment and our record is there to see.  Martin McGuinness's letter of resignation is very clear about what must be done.  Grassroots opinion is also quite clear.  Will the Taoiseach recommit to engage energetically and consistently with the British Prime Minister to uphold the Good Friday Agreement and to help to get the political institutions restored as soon as possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300005#C00700","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516717500,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I join Deputy Adams in welcoming the announcement by the group styled as &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann of its decision to end violence.  I also recognise the involvement of trade union leaders, politicians and others in that engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, with the new British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, has initiated a new series of talks between the parties in Northern Ireland.  That will be facilitated by the two Governments and we will be strongly engaged in it, acting in our role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  Indeed, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, will be in Belfast tomorrow with the Secretary of State and will engage urgently with all the parties to seek a way forward.  Contact has also been made between the Prime Minister, Mrs. May's, office and mine.  Both of us will be attending the same conference this week and perhaps will have an opportunity to speak there.  In that context I will emphasise my commitment to the talks process and to getting the assembly and the executive back up and running, which all of us wish to see happen.  Certainly, if personal engagement by me and the Prime Minister will make a difference, we will be happy to do that.  We have made that commitment in the past.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and nationalist people who consider themselves to be Irish not being left behind, that is something I said and meant.  I will follow up on it by meeting non-political people and leaders from civic society in Northern Ireland in the weeks and months ahead.  I hold the view that there is no right that anyone enjoys in Ireland or Britain that should not be afforded to people of both communities in Northern Ireland.  People in Ireland and in Britain can marry their same-sex partners and there is no reason that Northern Ireland should be an exception in this regard.  The same applies to issues such as language legislation and language rights.  If these apply in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, they should also apply in Northern Ireland.  However, the best way to achieve that is not having it dictated from Dublin or London but through the parties elected to represent the people of Northern Ireland coming together to form an administration.  I hope they will do that.<\/p>  <p>  While I firmly agree that rights are important, and Sinn F&eacute;in has put rights at the top of its list of priorities, there are other important matters as well.  Brexit is one example.  It is essential that there is a Northern Ireland voice on Brexit as we enter into the talks on the withdrawal agreement and the agreement that will set out the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  There are other practical, day-to-day issues that affect Northern Ireland.  I have read about what is happening in the health service in Northern Ireland.  The issues there are quite similar to the ones we are facing.  Of course, the Sinn F&eacute;in leader in the North, Michelle O'Neill, was the health Minister in Northern Ireland up until a few months ago.  I also read about the problems in the public finances in Northern Ireland, which are very different from the ones here, and the big and difficult decisions that will have to be made by the parties forming the executive to put the public finances back in order.  A Sinn F&eacute;in person was in charge of those finances up until a few weeks ago.<\/p>  <p>  Yes, I absolutely agree on rights, but taking responsibility is also important.  We should never use demands for rights as a means to allow us not to take responsibility as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516717500,"counter":20,"content":"<p>None of us should underestimate the difficulties facing unionist leaders.

It is self-evident that locally elected and accountable politicians are best placed to tackle this and the other social and economic issues and to defend public services such as health and housing.  Those of us who want Irish unity also know that is the best way forward.<\/p> <p> I again appeal to the Taoiseach to support this approach, as he is obliged to do under the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements and to ensure, in so far as he can, that the British Government and Prime Minister do likewise.

Rents are now at an all-time high in Dublin, 14% above the previous 2007 peak.  The pilot affordable rental scheme will be of little benefit to those facing record rents and new leases.  The Government plans to reduce costs, build smaller apartments, reintroduce bedsits and have people use shared kitchens and other facilities.  We still do not know how many new homes were built last year but it is believed that fewer than 10,000 new homes were completed in that period although between 25,000 and 35,000 were needed.  The private market has failed to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  The affordable purchase scheme is light on specifics but the hope is that it will deliver between 3,000 and 10,000 homes.  It would provide developers with access to State-owned property and the State would fund the servicing of State-owned lands.<\/p>  <p>  The newly rebranded council loan scheme has also been announced.  The amount that people can borrow under the scheme has been reduced from 97% to 90% of the cost of a house.  Those who might apply, many of whom have already visited my constituency office, are already paying record rents and will now have to face additional costs in terms of a deposit.  For example, a person would have to save a deposit of &euro;20,000 to purchase a &euro;200,000 house.  The help-to-buy scheme may provide some assistance in that regard and fixing interest rates would be of benefit over the lifetime of a loan but the numbers benefitting will be small.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, yesterday said there is no need for a new agency with money, power, resources and control of land to build and deliver affordable housing.  The State intends to change building regulations to make apartments more profitable, to provide the land for affordable housing, to pay for infrastructure through the housing activation fund, to finance developers - as announced at the time of the budget - through Home Building Finance Ireland, to help people to put together a deposit through the help-to-buy scheme and now intends to finance loans to home buyers through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  In that case, why do we not establish a new housing agency to deliver affordable housing and use the 700 publicly-owned sites we have and the monetary resources the Government has allocated - more could be available through NAMA - to work with the local authorities and voluntary housing agencies to build and deliver these houses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300007#E00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1516718100,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Government's objectives on housing are threefold.  First, it aims to reduce the number of people who are homeless.  I am encouraged by the reduction in the number of rough sleepers over the Christmas period and into January and the fall in the number of families in emergency accommodation in January as a consequence of Government actions.  However, one fall is not a trend, so I do not want to make too much of that although it is encouraging that those two things have been recorded and recognised.<\/p><p> The second objective is to provide more social housing in order to reduce the housing list.  I am encouraged that the number of houses being built by local authorities and approved housing bodies is increasing, from fewer than 700 in 2016 to more than 2,000 in 2017.  It will be closer to 4,000 this year.  If we could ramp things up quicker we would, but it takes time to ramp up construction in the public and the private sector given the lost decade we have had.<\/p> <p> One of our very important objectives is to recognise the fact that the vast majority of people provide their own housing.  They save, get a mortgage and buy their house.  This is what they want.  They want to be able to buy and own their own home.  We have to assist people to do that.  This involves a number of things such as putting in place actions that will help the private sector and builders to start building again.  We do not have a perfect measure of the number of houses that are built in the State in any given year but it appears to have been between 15,000 and 20,000 last year.  This also shows an increase in construction.  The fact is that we can see this construction all around us, be it cranes or housing estates in our constituencies.  We anticipate new home construction rising to between 20,000 and 25,000 this year, getting to the point where things stop getting worse, as it were, and perhaps getting better again the year after.<\/p> <p> As well as building houses, people need to be able to get mortgages and this is why the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, brought the proposals forward yesterday.  It is for people who have not been able to get a mortgage from the bank so they can go to their local authority and secure a low-interest loan with a guaranteed interest rate for 30 years, which I believe is a positive offer.  I am aware there were a huge number of calls being made to the authorities about the Rebuilding Ireland loan and extra staff have been taken on because of the number of people contacting the helpline and accessing the Rebuilding Ireland loan website.<\/p> <p> With regard to the setting up of new agencies, I believe that the establishment of a new agency is often the default solution to every problem in Ireland.  It does not always work.  It is not something we would rule out but we must be realistic about it.  It takes nearly 12 months to set up a new government agency and that is what one spends one's time doing during that period, not building houses.  This new agency would presumably still have to contract out to the private sector.  Unless it is taking on builders, carpenters, plumbers and so on, an agency such as that would have to contract and do procurement so even after a 12 month set-up period, it would only then be starting on the process of issuing tenders.<\/p> <p> I would also be very cautious of doing anything that takes the pressure off local authorities.  We are putting councils and local authorities under enormous pressure to start building again.  Some of them are doing better than others and it concerns me when I hear the Opposition suggesting that in some way responsibility might be taken away from the local authorities and handed over to an agency.  There would be some councils or local authorities who would not mind getting out of this entirely and if they thought that another party was going to come along and relieve them of this burden and obligation, it would not be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300007#E00400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516718400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Housing is an essential element of any civilised society.

They will be aware that no funding was available for local improvement scheme roads from 2011 to 2016.  I always would be of the contention that the most important stretch of road in the country for a person living in a rural area is the stretch from his or her own house to the next main road because, even if it is a private road, wherever a person is going he or she will have to travel that road anyway.  For those five years, no funding was made available to the local authorities.  During the 70 or 72 days of the discussions for the programme for Government, I raised this issue continuously, as did others, because it was so important to have it included in the programme.  I welcome that the Government kept its commitment - there is no better person to fight for and secure funding at budget meetings for these roads than the Minister, Deputy Ring - and I welcome the funding that was allocated, which was approximately &euro;10 million.  In my county, it made an awful difference and was most welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I seek two things.  The first is to ensure there is an increase in the funding because it is money extremely well spent.  It goes back into our local economies.  It is evenly divided among local authorities and has a local impact on rural areas as, given there is nothing worse than travelling a bad road, it improves people's quality of life.  If a person and all his or her family members have to travel a bad road every day, or perhaps five, ten or 15 times a day, it means much to have the road improved.  One could not get over how much it means.  The money strengthens local areas as it is extra work for local authority workers.  It is money for those supplying the materials and the work that needs to be carried out.  It is a win-win every way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300009#G00600","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1516719000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Chalk it down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300009#G00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516719000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am, therefore, seeking an increase in the funding this year and that the Minister, Deputy Ring, would be allowed to secure at least &euro;15 million rather than &euro;10 million.

I included it in my manifesto when I ran for leadership of my party.  It is also in the programme for Government, which the Deputy was involved in negotiating, and is something that is very much welcomed in rural parts of Ireland.<\/p><p>While these roads and laneways are not public roads, they are very often the part that accesses a number of houses, farms, businesses and so on and people who live in those houses and own those farms and businesses are people who pay tax too.  Even though the road may not be officially taken in charge, people living in rural Ireland pay their motor tax, pay excise on petrol and diesel, pay VRT and now pay the local property tax.  It is only right that we set aside some money for the local improvement scheme and we do so every year.<\/p> <p> The Deputy asked two questions.  The budget is &euro;10 million this year but it is too early to add to the budget now.  We can review it later if there is spare finance, either in the Department of Rural and Community Development or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but it is too soon at the moment to reallocate money between Departments.  On timing, I can give the Deputy a favourable answer.  Last year, the decision to reintroduce the local improvement scheme was only made in the summer, so we were not able to make the allocation until the latter part of the year, but it is the Minister's intention to bring it forward this year and to make the allocations in the first half of this year, if not in the first quarter, which will allow local authorities to make decisions sooner and will allow the work to be done in better weather, when it is drier over summer and autumn.

It is only allowing asylum seekers who have been here for six to nine months to work, more or less on the same basis as somebody who is applying for a work permit, in addition to that access to self-employment.  This is just a first step.  We made a previous announcement some months ago that there would be much wider access to the labour market, including employment for positions that pay less than &euro;30,000 a year.  It has not been possible to do that, get the procedures in place and notify the European Commission that we are opting into the directive, so we are not going as far as we intend to go.

What was announced this morning is a reform and new legislation.  As Deputy Brady is aware, no new legislation can be applied retrospectively.  For the record of the House, the reforms we announced today mean that the length of one's working life will no longer be the key factor in determining one's pension payments.  One's total contributions, regardless of the number of years worked, is what will be key.  The reforms provide for the addition of a credit for home caring.  Whether the credit is for caring for one's children or an elderly relative or whatever else, it will be determined once the assessment has taken place.  Given that this is new legislation, the start date for the payments will be the same as that for all the other payments that will be increased on the day the budget changes come into play in the week beginning 26 March.  No back-payment is being paid.  The legislation that was introduced in 2012 will still be the current legislation until I introduce new legislation.  According to that legislation, payments to be made will start accruing from 26 March to 30 March 2018, with payments being made in the first quarter of 2019.

Many people have said, rightly, that the debate on the likely referendum on the eighth amendment should be conducted in a reasonable and respectful manner.  However, the fact is that in the past it has often been people associated with the church, often in senior positions in the church, who have tried to reduce the argument to phrases such as \"abortion is murder\", \"it is about the destruction of innocent life\" and so on.

It is important that the Taoiseach sends out a very clear signal that the Government expects those who are anti-abortion not to polarise the debate with such terms, which are really derogatory and do not respect the decisions of huge numbers of Irish women to seek abortions under very difficult circumstances, whether as a result of poverty, rape, mental or physical health threats or whatever other reasons, and expects the church to commit not to denigrate women in the debate that is likely to ensue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300017#P01500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1516723500,"counter":126,"content":"<p>These structured discussions with leaders of various faiths have been ongoing for approximately a decade and they are a recognition of the importance of churches and other religious organisations in the lives of so many in our society and in our country.  Unfortunately, there has been a tendency in different areas for Ministers to announce policy towards institutions managed by religious groups through the media rather than raising them first in these dialogues.  One of the side effects of this has been to slow down important developments such as the transfer of patronage of national schools.  In that case, years have been lost as a previously co-operative approach was replaced by one of mutual suspicion.  This certainly happened in terms of the patronage issue.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach given any assurance of consultation before major changes in policy towards schools are announced?  Specifically on national schools under the patronage of minority religious groups, the cutbacks which targeted smaller schools had a deeply negative impact on them.  The changes to staffing allocations forced on the Government through the confidence and supply agreement are helping, but long-term security is needed for small rural schools, particularly those of minority religious denominations.  This is something of which I was always very conscious as a former Minister with responsibility for education.  It is extremely important that the minority religions, in terms of their education, are protected and that their ethos is facilitated in that regard.  It is just as important a part of diversity in education provision.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at the voluntary secondary school sector.  I believe there may be a bit of discrimination going on in terms of the capital funding of schools in the voluntary secondary school sector.  I am aware of a school in Rochestown, St. Francis College, which has been waiting seven or eight years for a new build.  It has now been told it will be an extension.  Meanwhile, other schools are being built.  There is no difficulty with the other schools.  There should be parity of esteem in the capital programme, irrespective of the tradition or ethos of any school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300018#Q00100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516723500,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Was there any discussion in the Taoiseach's meetings with the religious leaders on the issue of the quality of sex education in schools?  As the Taoiseach is aware, the vast majority of primary schools are controlled and owned by religious institutions.  Approximately half of secondary schools are directly controlled by religious institutions, and it seems to me there is a Catholic ethos in many community and ETB schools.  Does the Taoiseach believe it is possible to have real fact-based sex education in schools with a religious ethos?  Would a teacher who was inclined to give such an education in all cases discount the question of ownership of the school, the ethos of the school and the question of a so-called chill factor?  I wonder how issues such as contraception and abortion are taught in these schools.  There is the question of the LGBT community and transgender young people.  The very fact these schools are segregated is itself a form of discrimination against trans young people.  What is taught in terms of transsexuality?  What policies do these schools have with regard to flexibility on uniform policy for trans schoolchildren?  Perhaps when the Taoiseach next meets the religious leaders it might be time to state it is time to separate church and State in the realm of education for many reasons, not least of which would be the provision of thorough, modern, fact-based education, including sex education, for the children of the nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300018#Q00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1516723500,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I will start with the questions on the attendance of Pope Francis at the World Meeting of Families in Dublin.  My Department, through its protocol division, is assisting the church authorities in the organisation and preparations that need to be made for that visit.  Even though it is not formally a State visit, the assistance provided to Pope Francis will be the same as if it were.  Pope Francis will be given the full support of the State in terms of protocol, security and any other matters.  I understand from Archbishop Martin that the Pope's major interest in the visit is, of course, attending the World Meeting of Families.  This is why he is coming to Ireland and Dublin.  He may do one or two other things, but the focus of the visit will be the World Meeting of Families and the events associated with it.  Any decision on whether he will also visit Northern Ireland is, of course, a matter for him and the Vatican.<\/p>  <p>  I certainly want to join others in acknowledging the worries and legitimate concerns of people in Ballivor in County Meath at the proposed opening of a Narconon centre there.  This is, nonetheless, a free country which guarantees free association to people and citizens, so I am not sure whether the Government can do anything if it has planning permission for the centre.  Certainly, if people are there by free will and their own decision and they are not been detained against their will, it is difficult to know what actions the Government can take.  I will certainly speak to my public representatives in the area to see whether there is a way forward.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to abortion, my role, and that of the Minister for Health, at the meeting was largely to outline the process to date.  The process was established by the Government, which set up the Citizens' Assembly which then made recommendations which were considered by an all-party Oireachtas committee.  The reports of the Oireachtas joint committee and the Citizens' Assembly are now being considered by the Government and the Cabinet will make a decision shortly.  It is fair to say the Roman Catholic Church was opposed to the repeal of the eighth amendment.  The Protestant congregations were a little bit more nuanced, but were not supportive of the proposals made by the Oireachtas joint committee.  I certainly agree, as did they, that the debate that will occur over the next few months about changes to our laws should be respectful.  They should not be personalised and nobody should be pressurised to take a particular view or decision.  I call for respect from all sides for all sides in the debate.  The people will ultimately make this decision and I trust the people to make the right decision based on compassion and empathy while not disrespecting human life.<\/p>  <p>  There were discussions on school patronage, but most of this will be followed up bilaterally between the congregations and the churches and the Department of Education and Skills.  The view of the Government was that what should be paramount are the wishes of parents, especially parents of preschool children who are not already attending school.  There will be appropriate consultation and appropriate collaboration in achieving any change of patronage.<\/p>  <p>  I very much agree with the views of others on the need to respect minority groups and to protect minority schools.  All of us have a small Church of Ireland or Protestant school in our constituency that is a very important part of the fabric of those communities and we very much support them.

That is what seems to be happening.  It is meant to be a ten-year plan but it will be the first without estimates or costing attributed to it.  Will the Taoiseach explain the exact criteria being used for the inclusion of projects in the plan?  Will he give a personal assurance that there are no cases of Ministers telling State agencies where projects are to be built in direct contradiction of expert advice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300019#R00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724100,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I will start with the question on employment rights.

The Bill was published in the first half of December.  It supersedes the Bill put forward by Deputy Cullinane.  I am keen to have it in the House as soon as the Business Committee can provide time for it.  When we deal with the legislation, it is important we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.  I refer to when provisions in contracts might make sense.  For example, emergency services operate on an if-and-when basis.<\/p><p>It can make sense to have a certain number of core hours and an if-and-when provision on top of that, so people are called in when the work is available.  People who work in transport, logistics, shipping and aviation say that the same applies in their areas.  The ship comes in when it comes in and it is not always possible to know the exact times when staff are needed.  It is important that what we do makes sense.  We must protect workers and ensure they have greater certainty about their hours and incomes, but we also must not have a situation where employers are paying staff not to do any work for a prolonged period and then cannot get staff when they need them because of excessively restrictive legislation.  This was discussed at Cabinet rather than in the Cabinet sub-committee.<\/p> <p> Regarding the housing crisis, there are many reasons for us having such a great challenge with housing in the State.  However, the underlying issue is a lack of supply of suitable homes, apartments and houses.  There are more people who can afford to buy than are able to buy at present due to the lack of availability.  I do not fully agree with the Deputy's analysis in that regard.<\/p> <p> I am struck by the number of times today that Deputy Howlin has asserted I said certain things that I did not say.  I certainly did not say that wage increases were the largest threat to the economy as that is not my view.  It is probably Brexit, but other threats to the economy may arise.  I did say something along the lines of unsustainable or excessive wage increases potentially being a threat to the economy.  If they are unsustainable they would have to be taken back at a later stage.  We should not repeat the mistakes of the past by giving people welfare increases, tax cuts and wage increases only to take them back from them when they most need them a few years later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300019#R01200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":148,"content":"<p>That hardly arises now, does it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I did not say it arises now-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Why mention it now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I mention it now because the Deputy raised it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>No, the Taoiseach's article did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S00600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":153,"content":"<p>It was not an article.

I am determined that this Government should not repeat the mistakes that were made by previous Governments, which operated the inflationary and pro-cyclical economic policies that caused so much damage in years gone by.<\/p>  <p>  I said that the Government is committed to improving living standards.  By any objective measure living standards have been improving for the past two years.  The most recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, numbers from the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, show unemployment is substantially down, pay is increasing, poverty and deprivation are falling and inequality is narrowing.  I said that we could improve living standards in a number of ways, but particularly in three significant ways.  One is wage increases, which are well deserved.  That is why we increased the minimum wage and negotiated pay restoration with public servants.  The second area is tax reductions.  That is why we reduced the USC and income tax in the budget and improved tax credits for the self-employed and home carers.  It should be borne in mind that while the Government can increase the salaries of public servants it cannot increase the salaries of people who are self-employed or in the private sector.  One of the best ways of putting money directly back in the pockets of the vast majority of people, that is, people who are self-employed or work in the private sector, is through tax reductions.  That is the reason I disagree with the view of other parties that we should not have any tax reductions and that only public servants should see an increase in their wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S00900","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":156,"content":"<p>We must move on to the next group of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Finally, the other way is through reductions in the cost of living, which is why we introduced the child care subsidies and reduced the prescription charges and are taking action on insurance to reduce its cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","time":1516724700,"counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01200"},{"type":"question","time":1516724700,"counter":159,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[54820\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his attendance at the EU Council in December 2017.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1516724700,"counter":160,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[55056\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the proceedings of the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 14 and 15 December 2017; and the bilateral meetings he had with Heads of Government on the margins of this meeting.","asker":"1360","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1516724700,"counter":161,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[2008\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has discussed phase 2 of Brexit negotiations with Mrs. Theresa May since 1 January 2018; and if members of his Department have attended sherpa meetings for the same period.","asker":"1436","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1516724700,"counter":162,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[3090\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his attendance at the December 2017 EU Council meeting.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1516724700,"counter":163,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[3056\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300020#S01700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has spoken to Chancellor Merkel recently about Brexit.","asker":"1360","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516724700,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  As I outlined in my post-European Council statement to the House on Tuesday, 16 January, the December European Council met in four separate formats over the course of the two days, Thursday, 14 December, and Friday, 15 December.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting on Thursday afternoon focused on social, educational and cultural co-operation, as well as security and defence.

A number of interesting points were raised, such as including the social agenda as part of the European semester process - although a decision on this was not taken at the European Council.  There was also a short discussion around climate change and the \"One Planet Summit\" in Paris.<\/p>  <p>  Under the leaders' agenda that evening, there was a lengthy discussion on migration.

The Taoiseach informed the House last week that we will now move to phase 2, regarding transitional arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  Although it was difficult to get to the end of stage one, that would seem to have been the easier part.  We have since noticed a difference of interpretation of the agreement reached between the European Union and the UK in December.  There seem to be different interpretations in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the European Union.  It is important for that to be clarified.  I note the Taoiseach has not been in contact with the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, since then.  It is important to again reiterate what we mean by that agreement and that, as the Taoiseach said last week, there can be no backsliding.

The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has put forward his own vision in that regard.  It is clear that he favours increased centralisation, greater co-operation and more integration.  The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is finalising a new coalition between the two largest parties in Germany, which it seems will also result in calls for deepening integration.  The Franco-German axis is very much to the fore, which could lead to more harmonisation, a new eurozone budget and fiscal policy and a single EU corporation tax rate.  Against that, there has been a rise of illiberal tendencies in parts of the EU such as Poland and Hungary, while there has also been a rise in the far right in member states such as Austria.  Where does Ireland stand on this debate?  As the Taoiseach is aware, further integration could require treaty change and a referendum in Ireland.  We need to be very clear on such matters.

Having met British Government officials and politicians, suffice to say there is a very significant difference, as Deputy Haughey said, between how London and Dublin view the agreement.  Those in London who met members of Fianna F&aacute;il were at pains to stress that they see the agreement in terms of North-South areas of interaction as limited to the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement.

It will be this way until the end of February or March.  We negotiate as the European Union.  We were successful in the outcome of the phase 1 talks because we stuck to the position of not negotiating bilaterally but negotiating as part of the EU 27.  For that reason, and having assessed the last few months, I do not believe it would be wise for any EU Head of Government to differ publicly on the EU's negotiating position or to speculate too much.  I can say that our objective is to ensure the guarantees in the UK-EU report agreed in December and to make sure they are made legally binding in the withdrawal agreements, which is essential over the next few weeks.  We want a transition period to give businesses and individuals a chance to adjust to any permanent changes.  It will be around two years or that is what is being considered.<\/p>  <p>  On the future EU-UK relationship, of course we want free trade in goods and services to remain as it is now but not in a way that undermines the Single Market.  We are very much open to the possibility or idea of unique arrangement for Northern Ireland, but only if it is needed.  If the EU-UK relationship is close enough it may not be needed.  That is there as a back-stop.<\/p>  <p>  I did not inform the House of my meeting with Mr. Orb&aacute;n because at that stage it had not been arranged.  It was not confirmed until the middle of December.  It is important to point out that Mr. Orb&aacute;n is a democratically-elected Prime Minister of Hungary and we are aligned on a number of very important issues such as Brexit, a future close relationship with the UK and on tax.  Hungary and Bulgaria, which I also visited, both have lower tax rates than Ireland.  They can be important allies for Ireland when it comes to corporation profit tax.  The two countries very much agree with free trade and free enterprise; they are not protectionist.  We are, of course, not aligned on other issues.  I raised the issues, for example, on the law on non-government organisations, NGOs, the restrictions on academic freedom and the issue of Hungary not accepting its fair share of refugees.  I believe in engagement, however, even with prime ministers and presidents with whom one might not fully agree.  I am delighted that Deputies Howlin and Miche&aacute;l Martin, who raised this also believe in engagement, often with leaders with whom they might not fully agree.  On 18 October when visiting the Communist Party of China on the occasion of its 19th congress, Deputy Howlin took the opportunity, on behalf of the Labour Party, to \"extend fraternal greetings and best wishes to the leaders of the Communist Party of China.\"  These are fraternal greetings to a Government that is not elected and around which perhaps there are some concerns regarding human rights and executions and so on.  Deputy Martin, when he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, had to engage on many occasions with people he did not necessarily agree with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I am not criticising engagement-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Answers to questions please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":182,"content":"<p>On a point of order, we were not criticising the Taoiseach on engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":183,"content":"<p>At least &euro;5 million is being spent on this unit, one would have to do something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U00800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I asked about the European Union's attitude to Poland and Hungary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U00900","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":185,"content":"<p>That quote was Googled so I did not need much money for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":186,"content":"<p>A sum of &euro;5 million has been spent so it has to produce something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":187,"content":"<p>We are looking for answers to questions please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":188,"content":"<p>There were some very nice words spoken about al-Assad, but I will read them later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has missed the point completely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Priority Questions","time":1516725900,"counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01500"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":191,"content":"<p>We will now move on to questions to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","time":1516725900,"counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01700"},{"type":"question","time":1516725900,"counter":193,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[3356\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the rationale for the decision to allocate &euro;0.9 million of the Creative Ireland programme budget to initiatives under the heading, citizen engagement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, on her elevation and promotion to the Cabinet.

As part of the 2017 Creative Ireland\u00a0programme, my Department undertook a comprehensive citizen engagement programme, to which the Deputy alluded, to showcase the range and depth of Ireland's cultural and creative offering.  This is to encourage participation in arts and creative activities as a means of individual, collective and societal well-being and to build awareness of the Creative Ireland programme, particularly in its first year.<\/p>  <p>  The vision of the Creative Ireland programme is that every person in Ireland should have the opportunity to realise his or her full creative potential.  This represents a new approach to creativity and cultural policy and therefore required a substantial and sustained communications programme in 2017.  A\u00a0combination of approaches and platforms were used to maximise impact taking account of the diversity of the target audiences.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the citizen\u00a0engagement programme was very much informed by the positive\u00a0experience of previous programmes, particularly\u00a0the approach taken in the Ireland 2016 centenary programme.  In addition, statistics relating to readership of national and regional newspapers, listenership to local radio and increased use of social media, especially by younger\u00a0people,\u00a0all informed the choices made.  The programme was also designed to have as wide a reach as possible,\u00a0including in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure included supplements and resource material published in national newspapers, features in the regional press and regional broadcast media, which optimised the Creative Ireland programme online presence via two bespoke websites and associated social media content.  It also was about building awareness of the programme among the Irish diaspora in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the opportunity was taken in the initial year of the programme to engage and collaborate with several key cultural partners at various significant national events and festivals to promote the objectives of the programme and encourage deeper appreciation of the role of creativity in Irish life.  It was also envisaged that where opportunities arose, the Creative Ireland programme would engage with specific initiatives throughout 2017 to communicate the objectives of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  A full breakdown of how the Creative Ireland programme budget was spent in 2017 including all the elements referred to above is provided on\u00a0my Department's\u00a0Creative Ireland programme website.  That breakdown of costs is available if Deputy Smyth is looking for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300022#U02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1516725900,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I appreciate the reply.  I have the 2017 end of year report in front of me.  At a very quick glance, one can see a huge proportion of the funds in total have been spent on media and the promotion of the Creative Ireland programme, especially under the heading of citizen engagement.  In 2017 the budget for creative Ireland was &euro;5 million.  Of this &euro;0.9 million was spent on citizen engagement.  Almost &euro;400,000 was spent on supplements and articles in national newspapers, &euro;245,000 was spent on advertisements in regional newspapers and radio stations, &euro;165,000 was spent on what is described as optimising the Creative Ireland programme's online presence and &euro;86,000 was spent on media management fees.  A further &euro;0.6 million was spent on web and digital media content.  Each cent of public money that is spent on slogans, images and social media advertising budgets is money that is directed away from the artists.  My main concern is that the money for Creative Ireland is not actually reaching the artists themselves.

The events, festivals and partnerships sector received &euro;490,000, digital content spend was &euro;400,000, international spend was &euro;200,000, administrative support received &euro;500,000 and other initiatives received &euro;260,000.

With that in mind, my Department is leading a working group of relevant stakeholders, including the OPW, Meath County Council, the Heritage Council and the Discovery Programme, with a view to developing a conservation management plan for the State-owned lands at the hill.  This working group met as recently as 18 January 2018 when a provisional roadmap was agreed which anticipates the revised draft plan being ready for circulation in mid-summer.<\/p><p>The new plan will focus on\u00a0conservation and will inform a list of priority conservation and site management actions and measures.

One of the measures is the holding of workshops and the closing date for tenders for that is 26 January.  There will be an emphasis on dealing with sexual harassment and bullying in those workshops, which will be rolled out over the coming period.  Also, the Arts Council will be issuing invitations to other cultural institutions and arts centres throughout the country to avail of similar training, which will help create awareness of the issues the Deputy mentioned.  The Department has also written to all agencies highlighting the nature of their legal obligations under employment legislation.  They are governed by employment legislation and they will have their own guidelines, but we have to make sure they are following the guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  We also want to accelerate a planned review of compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, and that process will start shortly.

The workers say there is no oversight of this tax break, no governance and no enforcement and that, as a result, anyone who asks for direct PAYE employment, for example, will be blacklisted, there is bullying and the working time directive is being flagrantly abused in the industry.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at this and meet representatives of the film workers, who are considering industrial action as we speak because they are so fed up with the situation in the film industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300030#DD01300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1516730400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that he got enough time for two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300030#DD01400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516730400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett is right.  This is a really important problem.  Training in the sector has no beginning, middle or end.  It has no certification whatsoever.  It is a box-ticking exercise for firms to achieve their section 481 tax break.  What it means is that people who are well qualified and well experienced are forced to go into the same positions over and over again.  I have spoken to every sector of the film industry, and they agree there is absolutely a problem here.  There is also a problem with the fact that most films and TV series are made with special purpose vehicles that exist only for the duration of work on the film so individuals are only employed momentarily in these organisations.  There is a forum in a part of the Irish Film Board.  The Minister should get the Irish Film Board to launch the forum to allow for all the stakeholders to work together to ensure they start to fix this.  I believe there is a will in the sector to fix this.  Secondly, I ask the Minister to ensure the actual workers in this sector are appointed to the Irish Film Board in order that they themselves have an opportunity to represent real issues to the Irish Film Board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300030#DD01500","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1516730400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I will take a final supplementary question from Deputy Boyd Barrett and then revert to the Minister, and that is it because I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300030#DD01600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516730400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thought I would hear from the Minister and respond briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300030#DD01700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1516730400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The Deputy takes advantage of my generosity.

There is, therefore, no question but that we must do something about it.  The recommendations of the economic analysis, which was commissioned by my Department and the Department of Finance and has just been finalised, and the Crowe Horwath report will provide inputs for the development of an industry-wide long-term plan for the production of film, TV, drama and animation in Ireland under Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme.  The issue of training, including section 481 training requirements, will be considered in the context of this proposed plan.  I agree with the Deputies on this matter.  It is a condition of the tax relief that the project must employ a minimum of two trainees for each &euro;355,000 of corporation tax credit claimed, up to a maximum of eight trainees.  We must ensure that those trainees are looked after and that there is quality in this regard.  I will look at this in detail.  I have spoken to my officials about it already.  We know that production companies seeking section 481 tax relief must meet a range of conditions and have procedures in place to ensure compliance before the Revenue Commissioners issue a certification for filming of a project.  However, I appreciate what both of these reports have found and I will certainly look at the matter in more detail with the economic analysis and see what I can do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300030#DD02000","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1516730400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Boyd Barrett to ask a short supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300030#DD02100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516730400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I will press for urgency on this.

One might be a trainee for a couple of years, at which point one is certified and then a qualified worker in the film industry and should be paid and employed accordingly.  The issue is not just one of trainees, but also one of people being taken on as contractors, a little like bogus self-employment in the building industry, whereby one is never actually directly employed.

No disrespect to him, but I was hoping to discuss it with the Minister of State who has responsibility in this area, Deputy Jim Daly, because I met him before Christmas and he knows how pressing and difficult the issue is.  Nevertheless, I will use this opportunity to discuss it, in the hope the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, will bring back the message and perhaps schedule a follow-up meeting for me with the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, after this discussion today.<\/p>  <p>  We have a lack of mental health services in Kildare and I will focus on the constituency of Kildare North, in particular the areas of Celbridge, Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock, Clane and Naas, which have a population of approximately 120,000 people.  The real issue is that services are not available on the ground.  I will give three brief examples of this, before I discuss a possible solution I am trying to pursue with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.<\/p>  <p>  The post of primary care child psychologist in Kildare was left vacant for more than two years and the appointment was made only last year.  When we balance this with how serious mental health issues are we must ask ourselves why such a critical appointment takes so long.<\/p>  <p>  Last year in Clane, an area very close to me, a 15 year old minor, who was on suicide watch, was taken into the care of the State but allowed to go from A to B unattended.  As a result he went missing twice, on one occasion for up to five days. This was despite the fact garda&iacute; were out looking for him.  When he was returned to the care of the State it was allowed to happen again.  This is a serious issue and it is a major concern.  As I stated, he was on suicide watch.  Another issue arose with a young individual who was affected by a brain injury.  He received treatment and care but was discharged without any follow-up treatment or care.  As a result, he was badly affected in September and October when he was sleeping rough, walking the streets and could not be found.  He was not at home.  Eventually, through the voluntary organisation which I will discuss later, we got him back into follow-up treatment and services.  Another individual reported to the public health service over Christmas for mental health services.  He was told in Celbridge that no services were available, that he could not be helped and that nothing could be done for him.  Eventually we got him seen and put him in contact with Pieta House.<\/p>  <p>  This is what is happening on the ground, despite all of the delivery and funding announced and despite all of the positive news coming from the other side of the House about these services.  They are not being delivered.  These are three brief examples because I am conscious of my time.<\/p>  <p>  In Celbridge, a voluntary group has been operating for the past ten years.  It provides counselling and dual diagnosis.  It has more than 40 cases on its books.  It operates purely from bucket collections and cake sales.  I have met HSE senior officials in the past 15 months.  I have met the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and his predecessor to try to get public support for the organisation and finances to help it.  To date it has received absolutely nothing.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that this is a good partnership approach.  Where an organisation works with professionally qualified people, providing a service that is not being provided by the State, the State should partner it and support it, once it operates in a coherent and proper manner, which this organisation does.  It has gone through the task force and it has engaged with senior officials in the HSE.  The paperwork is done and all the boxes have been ticked.<\/p>  <p>  It is disappointing the services are not being delivered through the public health service and that the agency working on a voluntary basis, despite all my efforts, still does not receive support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300031#EE00400","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1516731000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy are for raising this very important issue.  I am well aware the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has had discussions with him on the subject and will continue to engage with him.  He appreciates the Deputy's very constructive approach in dealing with the issue and he apologises that he cannot be here today to take the debate.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to this serious issue, the HSE National Service Plan 2018 commits to further develop all aspects of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, including acute bed provision, better out-of-hours liaison and reducing waiting times, especially for those waiting more than 12 months.  The demand for CAMHS has seen a 26% increase in referrals since 2012 and therefore CAMHS is a strategic priority action for the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the Government has provided for an increase of &euro;35 million in development spending for mental health.  Part of this increase will pay for developments commenced last year.  There also will be additional funding of &euro;22 million for pay-related costs.  This will result in a mental health budget of &euro;910 million, which reflects an increase of around &euro;200 million, or approximately 28%, since 2012.  Mental Health is also guaranteed a further &euro;55 million in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Additional resources and facilities means there are now 69 CAMHS teams, and three paediatric liaison teams, supported by 70 operational CAMHS beds nationally, with further beds planned to come onstream as approved staffing posts are filled at local level.  It is envisaged that the increased funding will help develop the CAMHS service overall through provision of: a seven day per week service to enhance supports for vulnerable young persons in line with Connecting for Life; eating disorder specialist community teams; day hospital provision, in-patient admissions, and more appropriate supports for community teams; and enhanced access by older adolescents to specialist mental health services and, for those requiring acute admission, their continued appropriate placement and care.<\/p>  <p>  The acute CAMHS unit at Linn Dara, Cherry Orchard, covers the Kildare and south-west Dublin areas.  There are three consultant-led multidisciplinary community CAMHS teams serving County Kildare.  The north Kildare team is based in the new Celbridge primary care centre, the mid-Kildare team in Sycamore House, Millennium Park, Naas, and the south Kildare team is based in the new Kildare primary care centre.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations contained in A Vision for Change, a fourth team is coming into operation in Kildare from mid-February 2018.  The fourth team has been established to meet the increasing population of the county.  The new team will facilitate a realignment of catchment areas of existing teams, in line with the new primary care networks.  It is planned that this team will be co-located with the south Kildare team, pending the completion of a CAMHS suite in the new Clane primary care centre.  Six posts have been recruited for this team.<\/p>  <p>  There are also plans to increase the consultant staffing in the Kildare area to allow further service development.  The Linn Dara community teams also have access to a dedicated adolescent day programme and, from February 2018, to a specialist eating disorders team.  Both of these are located on the Cherry Orchard Hospital campus.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that CAMHS will continue to receive priority from the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, the Department of Health and the HSE.  One aspect in particular that the Minister wishes to develop is improved cross-referral within the HSE, and better inter-agency links between the executive and the education, disability, and child care sectors.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, will ensure that, in light of the significant funding provided in budget 2018 for mental health, CAMHS will continue to be prioritised by the executive, including improvements relating to Kildare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300031#EE00500","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1516731000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the detailed reply.<\/p><p>I do not disagree with the Minister of State's comments and I would not even suggest for a second it is down to a lack of funding.  It is a lack of accountability, people taking responsibility and delivery on the ground.  I accept everything the Minister of State spoke about in his statement but if it is the case, who is responsible for not delivering the service in just the three cases I have outlined to the Minister of State today because I was short of time?  With the last case I mentioned, the individual was turned away from the Celbridge primary care centre between Christmas and the new year, when he showed up with mental health issues.  He was told they could not help him as they had no services or resources.  He made contact with me and we got him into Pieta House.<\/p> <p> I am not coming after the Minister of State, the Government or the Minister because of a lack of funding.  I do not doubt them for a minute.  I have spoken with the Minister of State about other matters in his Department and despite the funding, we can clearly see cases that are not isolated.  When I raised this with the Taoiseach, he said they were isolated cases but they are not.  There is a trend here and the reality is services are not being delivered on the ground.  Can we get to the people who are responsible and accountable in the Health Service Executive, HSE, for not delivering these services?  Will there be consequences for not delivering them?  Why was a minor allowed to roam on his own last year?  He went missing twice on suicide watch.  This is happening and it is a reality.  We must find out why if there is no issue with funding.  The Minister of State has indicated the resources are there and more are coming, which is great news, but why are services not being delivered on the ground?  Why are there gaps in the service and why are we seeing such massive problems?<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State extend an invitation to the other Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to come to Celbridge to visit the Abbey Community Project, which has done wonderful work for the past ten years?

It is <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>as this is the fourth time I have had a Topical Issue on pretty much the same matter and the Minister has not yet turned up.  Senator Paul Gavan and I requested an urgent meeting with the Minister but we have not had a response to that either.  I ask the Minister of State to request the Minister to meet me and Senator Paul Gavan as soon as possible.  I am disappointed that the past few times I have had a Topical Issue on practically the same matter, the Minister has not been available.  As I say, I have tried to raise a number of times the serious position in this hospital and the way patients are treated.<\/p><p>Today, there are 60 people on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, with 668 people on trolleys nationally.  That is almost another outrageous record.  Almost 10% of patients on trolleys across the State are in one hospital in Limerick.  The hospital consistently has the highest number of people on trolleys across the State's hospitals, and it was the most overcrowded hospital in the State last year.  University Hospital Limerick saw 8,869 people on trolleys last year, which is absolutely disgraceful.  My constituents are entitled to an excellent facility that is not chronically overcrowded, the same as all other areas.  Unfortunately, it seems they are bottom of the priority list for the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p><p>When the new accident and emergency department was scheduled to open in May last year, I tabled a Topical Issue and the Minister, Deputy Harris, was not available at that time either.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, took the question.  I indicated the nurses had a serious concern before the opening of the planned accident and emergency department that 24 patients would be accommodated on trolleys and chairs from the get-go in the new department.  At the time, the Minister of State rebuffed what I said, dismissing any such suggestions.  He said there was no basis for any suggestion that 24 patients would be accommodated on trolleys in the new department.  He said that on 25 May 2017 but it has not been borne out as true.  Almost every single day there are more than 24 patients accommodated in trolleys in the new accident and emergency department.<\/p><p>The Minister of State may be aware that these problems stem from the downgrading of Ennis, Nenagh, and St. John's hospitals' accident and emergency departments and establishment of a so-called centre of excellence.  That has not worked and the facility has been overwhelmed.  One might walk into the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick today and explain to the 60 people on trolleys how the plan has not worked.<\/p><p>I raise in particular the full capacity protocol.  The Minister of State is well aware this was designed to be an emergency measure to deal with overcrowding and is not supposed to be used every day.  It has consequences and it results in patients being put in inappropriate areas of the hospital, leading to overcrowding in wards, cancellation of elective procedures and aggressive discharging.  It is not intended to be used every day and become the norm.  In University Hospital Limerick it has, unfortunately, become the norm.  It was used on 361 days last year, compared with nine days in 2014.  Yesterday, we learned the number of patients waiting for outpatient appointments in University Hospital Limerick has increased by a massive 6,786 people in just one year to an astonishing 32,632 people.  It is a 26% rise in one year.  The Minister has said he has a handle on the health crisis and I am sure that will be in his response when he gets back to me.  The number of patients being forced to wait in excess of 18 months for treatment has more than doubled in one year, rising from 1,517 to 4,124.<\/p><p>I commend the nurses, doctors and staff who work in University Hospital Limerick in what can be extremely challenging conditions.  I am running out of time but I could stand here for another 20 minutes highlighting the issues.  What action will the Minister, Deputy Harris, take to ensure the full capacity protocol is not implemented in University Hospital Limerick almost every single day, which it was in 2017?  How will he ensure it is only ever used when there is a genuine emergency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300032#FF00400","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1516731600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  It is unacceptable that patients must wait on trolleys for long periods, especially those who may be elderly or vulnerable.  The full capacity protocol was devised in order to redeploy hospital resources towards surges in demand for emergency care, thereby reducing emergency department waiting times.  I accept the argument that the department in University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with approximately 67,000 attendances annually.  Demand for emergency department services at the hospital continues to rise, with an increase of 6% in attendances at the hospital in 2017 compared with 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware that overcrowding at the hospital's emergency department has been a concern for some time.  It is frequently working above capacity using full capacity protocol and this contributes to inefficient ways of working and poor patient experience.  In recognition of this high demand, funding of &euro;24 million was provided for the new accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, which opened in May last year.  The new facility is triple the size of the old department and immeasurably improves the experience of patients in terms of their comfort, privacy and dignity.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, visited the department on its opening last year and was very impressed with the pod-based design to streamline patient pathways.<\/p><p> I accept the Deputy's point.  The emergency department at UHL continues to be challenged and sees too many patients on trolleys each day.  The Minister has been in direct contact with the director general of the HSE, the hospital group chief executive officer, the group clinical director and the head of the HSE's special delivery unit to express his concerns about high trolley numbers and to seek assurances that action is being taken to address the situation urgently.  The special delivery unit has been working closely with hospitals currently experiencing emergency department pressures with a view to improving patient flow and reducing the number of patients on trolleys.  At the request of the Minister, Deputy Harris, UHL has submitted an emergency department performance improvement plan which sets out in detail how performance will be improved.  The plan is currently being implemented and I expect to see incremental improvement.<\/p> <p> To alleviate overcrowding pressures, 17 new surge capacity beds opened in the old emergency department in UHL in September 2017.  These beds will be converted into a medical short-stay unit in 2018 which, again, is a measure to combat the requirement of using the full capacity protocol.  UHL was also chosen as a pilot site for a national HSE programme designed to improve patient flow across acute hospitals and the wider health service.  This programme is aimed at developing and assessing different approaches to the improvement of patient flow.<\/p> <p>To conclude, the Minister is acutely aware of the current situation in UHL in terms of using the full capacity protocol and is monitoring the situation closely.  The Department, the HSE and the University Limerick hospital group are carrying out measures to improve this situation and reduce the need to utilise the full capacity protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300032#FF00500","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516732200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I agree the new emergency department in Limerick looks great but, unfortunately, the concerns we raised before it opened have come to pass.  Huge numbers of people are waiting on trolleys and for unnecessary durations of time.  My fear is that I will be in the House again next year highlighting the same problems in that hospital.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, brought a bed capacity review to the Cabinet today.  However, we do not need any more reviews, studies or investigations.  What is needed in UHL is more money, extra beds and more staff today, not ten years hence, to accommodate the number of patients presenting at the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State might be aware that the interns and non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, are to ballot on industrial action in the hospital next week.  We do not know when the 96-bed extension will be up and running.  It will alleviate the problems but it is years late.  There is no point in constantly talking about it.  If the work begins immediately it will be years before there are extra beds for patients in the hospital.  Has the funding for the 96-bed extension been allocated?  It has been talked about for a long time but when will it be built?  Obviously, if the Minister, Deputy Harris, were present he might be able to answer that question but perhaps the Minister of State will relay my concern to him.  What interim measures are being put in place to bring down the hospital trolley count or will the Minister just sit back and hope that the influenza passes, which will bring down the numbers?<\/p>  <p>  The main question in this Topical Issue, however, is: what measures will be introduced to stop the use of the full capacity protocol?  Does the Minister think that using the full capacity protocol - having extra trolleys in the hospital every day in 2017 and every day so far in 2018 - is safe and does he stand over the fact that it is happening?  Will he confirm if any additional staff will be assigned to deal with the outpatient waiting list, which has grown by more than 6,000 in a year?  These problems are massive and urgent.  They require comprehensive solutions.

Before our time in Government, the accident and emergency departments in Ennis and Nenagh were closed.  This was part of creating a logjam in the system.

However, it sums up my feelings for my native town.  The Minister of State has visited it many times on a personal basis.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the town has been brought to its knees due to flooding on three occasions since 2009, the last two floods happening only weeks apart.  I acknowledge the amazing heart and extreme resilience of the people of Bandon.  They got up and fought back each time.  The Minister of State will be aware that a &euro;16 million flood relief scheme for Bandon is currently being undertaken by the Office of Public Works in partnership with Cork County Council.  This badly needed scheme is expected to alleviate the serious flooding that has blighted the town for many years.  The work has been progressing well to date, but local residents and business owners are becoming extremely anxious as a result of the weather conditions we have been experiencing lately.  On 19 January last, the town was again on flood alert.  I acknowledge the fantastic work done that day by the fire service and council workers who kept the flood at bay.<\/p>  <p>  Quite simply, residents and business owners are at the end of their tether and unable to deal with the devastation another flood would cause to their properties, particularly in circumstances where they are unable to get insurance.  Bandon experienced a severe flood in 2009.  We were told then that it was probably a one in 99 year experience and we hoped that was the case.  Unfortunately, it happened again in December 2015 and, unbelievably, again a few weeks later.  After 2009 many residents and businesses were unable to access flood insurance so the next two floods left the people in Bandon devastated.  People in many towns in west Cork, such as Bandon, Clonakilty, Bantry and Skibbereen, cannot get flood insurance.  Although this is a matter for another day, it would be only fair that after the flood relief works are carried out in these towns people should once again be able to get flood insurance.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative that the main drainage scheme in Bandon commences on schedule, which we understand will be in the second quarter of this year.  The drains in Bandon are extremely old and are no longer fit for purpose.  When there is heavy rain the drains are unable to cope.  If the Bandon river rises the water comes up the drains, so there is an up and down problem.  In essence, these drains are well past their sell-by date and major works are essential.  My constituents need and deserve answers.  It is not acceptable that they must live in constant fear of the next weather forecast.  Can the Minister give an undertaking that no more time will be wasted on these works and that definite dates will be provided, particularly a guaranteed commencement date for the main drainage scheme in Bandon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300033#GG00800","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1516732200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for raising this important issue.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran.<\/p><p>As the Deputy rightly pointed out, I have personal knowledge of this issue.  My brother is a publican on the main street in Bandon and his business premises was one of those flooded.  The Deputy is correct in so far as his premises flooded not from the street but, rather, the toilet cisterns.  The flooding came from the sewer, up the toilet and into his pub.  Such an occurrence would be absolutely devastating for any business.  I also have first-hand experience of such events in my town of Newcastle West, which was also flooded.  I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for raising the issue.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, visited Bandon last summer to see the great work being done to bring much-needed relief from flooding to the people and businesses of the town.  He met with councillors, local Deputies, residents and business owners, who were all very relieved that, following some early delays, works were finally under way.  The Bandon scheme is progressing well.  Like any major civil engineering project, it is not without its difficulties but, on behalf of the Minister of State, I assure the Deputy that he has been emphasising to his officials that every effort must be made to ensure the scheme remains on target for completion in mid-2019 in accordance with the latest agreed construction programme.<\/p> <p> Following the severe flooding in Bandon in November 2009, the Office of Public Works appointed consultants to develop proposals for a flood relief scheme for the town and to undertake an environmental impact study of the developing proposals.  A preferred scheme was brought through the public exhibition process in 2012 and the proposals received a generally positive welcome.  The  Office of Public Works has been working in close co-operation with Cork County Council in developing and progressing the scheme.  The scheme includes the following main elements: new walls and embankments; excavating the channel by approximately 1.6 m for a distance of 3.5 km; replacement of the pedestrian bridge; underpinning Bandon Bridge; construction of new fish passages; and associated drainage works, including new pump stations.<\/p> <p> Following completion of the detailed design, the Bandon scheme was confirmed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, on 4 April 2016, which allowed the Office of Public Works to proceed with the scheme.  The contract was awarded on 9 of June 2016 to Wills Bros Limited and construction of the scheme commenced in late July 2016.  There were some initial contract issues to be resolved which led to a delay in substantive works getting under way.  Thankfully, those issues were resolved. <\/p> <p> Good progress is being made across all the main areas of work.  Bandon footbridge works are progressing well and are due for completion by the end of February.  The steel deck was lifted into place on 6 December last.  Works associated with the ramps and walls, including large service diversions, are ongoing.  Finishing works, including polished concrete surfacing and railings, are anticipated to commence this month and the bridge is due to be opened in March.  Works are ongoing at Glasslinn Road and are due to recommence at Brady&rsquo;s Lane and Bridge Street this month.  Culvert installation works have been completed at Mill River within the grounds of the old distillery, almost completed at the Kilbrittain Road stream and are ongoing at Moanarone or Distillery Road.  The construction of new flood defence walls is ongoing at Graham Norton Walk, The Stretch, Watergate Steet, Glasslinn Road wall and Mill Place.  Some major elements of in-river works are scheduled to commence in May on the Bandon river and on a fish pass in the river.  These are critical works and the project management team will be working very closely with the contractor to ensure they are completed within the programme.  The scheme is expected to be substantially completed by July 2019 and the Minister of State is confident that target will be met.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Murphy O'Mahony pointed out, the completion of the Bandon scheme will bring great comfort to the residents and businesspeople of the town.  Like the residents of other towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Kilkenny and Clonmel where major OPW schemes have been built, they will no longer have to live in fear of severe weather and rainfall warnings but, rather, will know their homes and businesses are protected from flooding.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to addressing the most significant flood risks in the country.  Some &euro;350 million has been spent on building 42 major schemes, protecting almost 9,500 properties.  However, there is more to be done.  Within the existing programme of capital flood works, eight schemes are at construction phase, eight more are due to start construction this year and a further 18 are in the pipeline.  In addition, approximately 100 other schemes are included in the flood risk management plans under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme for which the Minister of State will shortly be seeking approval.  This represents a major programme of investment in flood protection and the Minister of State is confident that the new ten-year capital plan 2018 to 2027 will see a continued significant allocation of funding for flood relief projects, including in places such as Bandon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300033#GG00900","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516732800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister of State acknowledged that he realised first hand what the people of Bandon went through.

I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for coming to the House to address the issue.  Like many colleagues, over the Christmas recess I had the opportunity to traverse County Offaly more thoroughly than I would while the D&aacute;il is in session.  Many of the important routes in the county are in a state of disrepair following harsh winter weather conditions and persistent heavy rainfall, coupled with the unique circumstances that pertain in Offaly and parts of north Tipperary as a result of the extent to which our road network crosses boglands.  The water table has been very high all winter, which is putting huge pressure on the road network.  Subsidence and large potholes are developing on our regional roads, which makes driving conditions very dangerous for motorists, who expect regional roads with speed limits of 80 km\/h to have consistently good surfaces.  In recent weeks, I have been inundated by constituents contacting me to express concern and frustration with the condition of the roads.<\/p>  <p>  Now that the economy has recovered and we are all working in a determined manner to attract enterprise and increased tourism activity to the county, the road network urgently requires additional investment that recognises the very specific nature of the network, which is built on peat foundations.  I am very concerned by the situation.  Engineers accept that road surfaces built on peat foundations require significantly more investment to ensure standards are maintained.  The surface of such a road will last for approximately five years in normal conditions compared to an expected lifespan of 20 years for roads built on proper foundations.  The Minister will recall a presentation in Edenderry at which the local engineer highlighted that issue to him.  It is apparent following the recent persistent rainfall that structural problems are developing on the regional, local and tertiary road network, which means that local authorities in Offaly, Tipperary County Council and Laois require\u00a0additional funding from the Minister&rsquo;s Department to help mitigate the problem before it gets worse.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to highlight the routes by which I am most concerned.  The R357 from Blueball to Shannonbridge is a very important, busy regional route, many stretches which have been undermined over the winter months.  Many other road arteries are causing a driving hazard for drivers who may not be familiar with them.  For example, in north Tipperary the very important R438 Borrisokane to Athlone regional route is flooded.  The last time that road was so heavily flooded, people were able to jet ski on it because it was like a huge pond.  I do not advocate such behaviour but it illustrates how much water was on the road.<\/p><p>Locally there are engineering solutions and I am aware that the local authority has suggestions and ideas but the funding is what is at stake.<\/p> <p> I drove the R436 recently when I did my clinics from Tullamore, back through Ferbane and on to Moystown Cross via Belmont.  That road is in dreadful condition for a regional route.  The road is actually subsiding at the edges and in the middle, not to mention the amount of potholes, and it is really dreadful to see the damage there.<\/p> <p> I also spoke of the additional work that is required on the N62 and the N52.  I will not go back into that again because I know the Minister is well aware of this.  There needs to be recognition that rural dwellers pay their motor taxes, their property taxes, their VRT and so on.  They depend on the road network to go about their daily lives.  I am very concerned about the deteriorating condition of the regional, county and tertiary road network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300034#HH00600","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516733400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Corcoran Kennedy for raising this very important issue, which has become even more acute since I visited the Deputy's area in Offaly a few months ago.  The case was made very eloquently by the Deputy and by others for the difficulties experienced when roads have been built on peat foundations, and the effect that lack of investment has on these roads.  I am particularly taken by the statistic given by the Deputy - and which was given to me on that visit - that a repair that might be expected to last for 20 years in the normal case might only last five years in some of the roads mentioned.  The case made by the Deputy today should certainly be considered in the future when road grants are being handed out.<\/p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities&rsquo; own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has just less than 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  The Deputy will be aware that because of the national financial position, there were very large reductions in the Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis.  For this reason the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than new improvement projects in recent years.  I envisage that this emphasis on maintaining assets, together with safety measures, will continue into the next capital plan period.<\/p>  <p>  Account has been taken of conditions referred to by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy as encountered in Offaly.  This will be reflected in terms of the grant programmes that will be announced by me in the near future.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has allocated &euro;153,962 towards Offaly&rsquo;s winter maintenance scheme.  In this context, it is important to reiterate that the purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement the own resources spending of local authorities and I have emphasised to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating own resources, including revenue from local property tax receipts.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are aware that it is a matter for each council to determine its priorities and to allocate funding accordingly.  Given the funding constraints, my objective has to be to allocate funding to local authorities on as equitable basis as possible.  The main grant categories are, therefore, based on road lengths in each local authority&rsquo;s area of responsibility.  The division of Department grant moneys under the restoration improvement, restoration maintenance and discretionary grant programmes between different local authority districts is decided at local level.  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for specific grants for schemes costing less than &euro;5 million and for strategic improvement grants for schemes costing more than &euro;5 million with a view to strengthening, widening or realigning regional and local roads.  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed from 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.  It is a matter for Offaly County Council as part of its budget and road programme planning process to assess the condition of its road network and what works might be needed taking into account its overall priorities.<\/p>  <p>  When I am making any allocations in the near future, I will bear in mind Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's comments today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300035#JJ00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1516733400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the answer and for acknowledging that consideration will be taken of the special condition roads in that area.  I will certainly appreciate that.  The Minister made reference to schemes being curtailed since 2013.  We can really see the effect of this curtailment five years later with some roads becoming narrower.  I also believe that climate change has an impact on it and I have no doubt that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will examine the impacts on our roads from the monsoon-like rainfall Ireland is having.  The R400, which we spoke about when the Minister was in Edenderry, is a connecting route from Rhode to Portarlington.  It is a very important strategic route that links the M6 to the M7 and it needs to be prioritised.  I have no doubt that Offaly County Council will most certainly do this.<\/p>  <p>  The re-launch of the local improvement schemes by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and the Taoiseach was most welcome at the National Ploughing Championships last year.  There was a queue of communities waiting to avail of that funding and it was used up very quickly.  I am aware that an enormous amount of funding remains in that scheme.  I hope that we could get an increase in that funding.  I welcome that new funding will be announced for that, as mentioned earlier today by the Taoiseach in Leaders' Questions.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister consider looking again at the community involvement scheme?

We have looked at it since I came into office, but financial constraints and priorities have restrained us from putting any more money into it.  We will consider it in the next budget.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for road maintenance and improvement in County Offaly is provided by the council's own resources, supplemented by grants.  The allocation for 2018 is expected to be announced in the next two weeks.  The Department has also emphasised to all councils the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating their own resources, including local property tax receipts.<\/p>  <p>  The main grant programmes operated by the Department are focused on specific policy objectives such as surface sealing to protect the road surface from water damage.  Restoration maintenance grants cover road strengthening, based on pavement condition and weighting, to lengthen the life of roads.  Restoration improvement grants are discretionary grant schemes that cover various activities including the provision for winter maintenance.  These three grant programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated based on the length of the road network in a particular local authority area.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for funding under the low-cost safety improvement scheme in 2018 were invited on 26 September 2017.  Councils were made aware of the conditions for the applications for funding and were advised that preference would be given in the cost range of &euro;2,000 to &euro;30,000, and that proposals in the higher cost ranges of &euro;30,000 to &euro;250,000 may be considered if the benefit-to-cost ratio was promising.  Offaly County Council applied for funding for six schemes to the sum of &euro;292,000.  The council will be notified shortly of allocation of funding for these schemes.  It is up to individual local authorities to submit applications in order of priority.  Allocations to individual municipal districts within the county are a matter for the county council and the Department has no role in that process.  TII is progressing major pavement renewal and strengthening schemes on the N52 and N62, costing a total of &euro;1.97 million.

Last Wednesday, the opt-in proposal was discussed and broadly welcomed by members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  The motion was subsequently passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann earlier today.  If the House's approval is granted this evening, the formal notification letter will be sent to the European Council and the European Commission immediately thereafter so that we will be in a position to begin the four-month compliance procedure with the Commission.  I should point out that this four-month period is mandated under the EU treaties.<\/p><p>The migration crisis and asylum have been in the headlines here and around the world for a number of years now.  For this reason, I wish to take this opportunity to clarify some issues.  The Government has made a strong commitment to playing its part in addressing the refugee crisis arising from the protracted conflict in Syria.  Deputies will be aware of our voluntary opt-in to the EU resettlement and relocation programmes which will see 4,000 people coming to Ireland to begin a new life here.  Deputies will also be aware of the commendable work of our Naval Service which has come to the aid of those fleeing conflict as they perilously cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe.  We have made a significant contribution to the international humanitarian aid directed towards victims of the Syrian conflict through our partner NGOs and a raft of international organisations.<\/p><p>It is important to clarify any potential misunderstanding that may arise in respect of those fleeing conflict in Syria.  First, those who come to Ireland from conflict zones under our resettlement programme arrive with refugee status.  Second, those who have come from Greece under the European Union relocation programme will have their status determined quickly and usually within a period of three months.  In both cases, those coming to Ireland under the Irish refugee protection programme will already have full access to our labour market.  Separately, based on the current situation, those who come to Ireland of their own volition and make an application for international protection upon arrival generally come from different regions.  Currently, Georgia, Albania, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Nigeria constitute the top five countries of origin of applicants for international protection who present spontaneously at our frontiers and enter the international protection applicant process.  Each application is, of course, considered solely on its own merits.<\/p><p>The Supreme Court gave its judgment in the NVH case on 30 May last and, having given the matter detailed consideration, the Government chose to interpret this decision in a broad way, reflecting the calls from Deputies and Senators and acknowledging the work of the McMahon group and a number of NGOs in so far as they were encouraging that Ireland should align its bespoke system with European norms and standards.  In opting into the EU reception conditions directive, recast, the Government has chosen to be ambitious and to enhance and protect the rights of international protection applicants and their families.  We are using the opportunity afforded to us by the Supreme Court decision to continue our programme of reforms undertaken since 2014.  In addition to labour market access, the directive also includes important provisions on children&rsquo;s rights, including rights for unaccompanied minors, as well as provisions on health care and education.  Participation in the directive will place the provision of material reception conditions for applicants, which are currently provided for under the Executive system of direct provision, on a statutory basis and it will be underpinned by EU law for the first time.<\/p><p>The State already has a functioning employment permits system for third country nationals which we must be careful not to disrupt or undermine, nor must we take any action which could be detrimental to our legal migration system.  The court&rsquo;s judgment acknowledges the role of the Executive and Legislature in setting these parameters.  Once the State&rsquo;s participation in the directive is confirmed, I intend to provide for access for eligible applicants by way of an immigration permission which would exempt applicants from the employment permits system and any associated fee.  In determining the list of sectors of employment to which access will be granted, regard will be had to the skill set of applicants and to labour market gaps as well as to the expert advice of front-line Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300036#KK00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1516734000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>The balance of the Minister's contribution can be included in the Official Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300036#KK00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516734000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I did not realise I was so constrained.

There is no doubt that opting in to the directive entails allowing asylum seekers limited access to the labour market.  In general, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the decision to opt in to the directive, which was a recommendation of the McMahon working group.  It will bring Ireland's asylum system in line with European norms.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has long advocated for reform of the direct provision system.  Asylum seekers spend far too long in the system which was designed in 2000 to be a short-term interim provision to deal with the high number of asylum seekers entering the State.  That was to be an interim measure but here we are 18 years later.  At present, approximately 36% of residents spend two years or more in direct provision, which some of them have described as a form of internment.  The delays in assessing applications for asylum remain unacceptable.  The long periods spent in direct provision have a negative impact on both the mental health and well-being of the individual.  It also impedes integration and creates a legacy of dependency.<\/p>  <p>  The McMahon working group published its report in 2015.  It made a number of recommendations, including that asylum seekers who are awaiting a decision on their application for asylum for more than nine months and who have co-operated with the process should be allowed to work.  Fianna F&aacute;il supported the recommendation.  Three years have passed, however, and only now is the Government starting to act.  I contend that the Government is only acting now because it is being forced into implementing the recommendations of the Supreme Court which concluded in May 2017 that prohibiting asylum seekers from working is unconstitutional.  Despite that Supreme Court judgment, the Government has delayed introducing provisions to allow asylum seekers work.  The ban on the right to work will be struck down as unconstitutional on 9 February 2018.  Therefore, a temporary measure has to be put in place between 9 February and the date on which Ireland will have completed all necessary measures to opt in to the directive.  Why did it take so long?  I contend that there was appropriate time to deal with this without having to put an interim measure in place.  We should have gone straight to a situation of opting in without interim measures.  The interim measures permitting asylum seekers to work are restrictive.  They are restricted to seeking jobs in specified sectors and the job must attract a salary of at least &euro;30,000.  I accept that the Minister spoke about the issue of asylum seekers having to pay for an employment permit.  If my understanding is correct, that will not now be the case.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the implementation of the reception conditions directive will have positive implications beyond the right to work.  These include greater protections for children and vulnerable applicants seeking asylum.  The asylum reception system which we call direct provision will have to be put on a statutory footing and this will ensure that the system has appropriate parliamentary oversight.  This must be a welcome step towards introducing a more humane reception system for asylum seekers.<\/p><p> I understand work permits will be restricted by the list of highly skilled and ineligible categories that apply to work permit applicants, which are very restrictive and exclusionary criteria.  The current list indirectly discriminates against women, as the majority of employment categories eligible for work permits are in male-dominated jobs.  Female asylum seekers would, then, be additionally adversely affected by this intern scheme as it currently stands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300036#KK00500","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516734600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go raibh cuid mhaith d&iacute;om&aacute; faoin bplean agus faoin sc&eacute;im a chur an tAire os comhair an choiste an tseachtain seo caite agus at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu.  As I said last week in the committee, the Department appears to want garlands and congratulations for this measure, which is quite extraordinary given that despite the positive language and the move to engage fully with the consensus, since 1996 successive Governments have opposed the right to work for asylum seekers.  This has been re-emphasised most recently in the International Protection Act 2015 and we are only discussing this directive and the right to work on the basis of the NHV <i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality last May.  The Government now arrives with an interim measure that is impossibly restrictive and it is difficult to anticipate any asylum seeker being in a position to obtain work before the passing of the legislation.<\/p><p>The restrictions have been detailed and include having to pay over &euro;30,000 per annum, with some 60 occupations excluded and a cost of between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 for a work permit.  That would be an extraordinarily high threshold if it applied to Irish citizens and many here would struggle to satisfy the criteria, let alone those who are fleeing war and oppression.  To say this is a day late and a dollar short would be a bit of an understatement.  The directive is an improvement and we support the Government's decision to transpose it but it needs to go back to the drawing board.  Legislation will ultimately issue for the full implementation of the directive although, as Deputy O'Loughlin outlined, despite the fact that direct provision was intended as an interim measure, we are still dealing with it a long time later.  The interim measures are simply not good enough and do not constitute a satisfactory right to work.  I also believe this would be open to legal challenge in advance of the passing of primary legislation.  The NHV judgment is far from perfect and I would have preferred the Supreme Court to have gone a degree further but there was a clear expectation that the Government would act and it has been quite slow to do so.  The decision was made in May last year and we are only seeing action now.<\/p><p>We have been contacted by a number of people in organisations working with asylum seekers.  They are very disappointed and are angry at the deeply restrictive nature of this approach.  I am also concerned that the final legislation might involve pull factors and gaps in the labour market, although the Minister attempted to reassure me in a previous debate.  The right to work, as the Supreme Court recognised, is based to a large extent on human dignity and on people's ability to play a full role in the community.  There should not be a utilitarian approach to fill gaps in the labour market.  We must have a full and realistic right to work, with nine months much too long to wait.  I would not like to see anything like the restrictions that exist under the Employment Permits Act 2003 and in the unacceptable interim measures, on which the Government should go back to the drawing board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300037#LL00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1516734600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>This proposal is a belated response to a long-running scandal.  All of us have become somewhat inured to the unconscionable delays in the asylum seeking decision-making process.  As Minister of State, my colleague Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in invited Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon and a group of experts to review the whole asylum system in 2014 and that investigation resulted in 172 recommendations including, crucially, on the right of asylum seekers to access the labour market.  Nothing happened on this front until May last year when the Supreme Court declared section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act, which prohibits access to employment for applicants, to be unconstitutional.  Significantly, the court did not immediately strike down that section, as it might have produced a chaotic result.  Instead, it invited a response from Government on how it wished to proceed.  The court adjourned consideration of its order for six months and invited the parties to make submissions on the form the order might take.  At the hearing on 30 November, the Government outlined its plans to opt into the directive and ask for another extension of time to cover the seeking of Oireachtas approval and an additional four-month process which would be required, as the Minister has again said tonight, to inform the European Commission that we were opting in.<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court was clearly unhappy with the further delay in dealing with this issue that has characterised every stage and which can only be seen as unreasonable.  The court struck down the prohibition on international protection applicants accessing the labour market as and from 9 February 2018.  As usual, it is the legislative branch, this House and the other House, which is the last to be informed of this, with this only coming before committee last week and expected to be passed by both Houses now.  If we do not opt into the directive by 9 February we will need temporary measures.  Applicants will, as an interim measure, be applying via the employment permit system in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the same basis that applies to other non-EEA nationals, even though no other non-EEA nationals have the benefit of a Supreme Court decision regarding their employment rights.  We have not, as yet, seen a full solution to this long-running issue but perhaps one is in sight, as the Minister said.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome and support the decision to opt in to the directive but we are all agreed that the access to the labour market the Minister proposes as a interim measure is not acceptable or adequate.  The degree of access he proposes is not something decided by the directive or EU law but is a decision for the Minister and the Government themselves and one on which the Minister is taking a far too restrictive and cautious approach.  I recognise that there are issues in determining the level of access to be provided by applicants but many applicants will have to be examined in very great detail once the information is known.  The Minister says that, in determining the list of sectors of employment to which access will be granted, regard has to be had to labour market gaps.  We will need to be told considerably more than that.<\/p><p>In fact, it may be good to contemplate social employment to involve people and to ensure they are fully integrated into Irish society.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  The UK and Ireland opted out of the reception conditions directive in 2003 and 2013, in line with their treaty entitlements.  Up to now we have been semi-detached members of the common European asylum system.  We are in the Dublin regulations and Eurodac<b><\/b>but have opted out of the reception conditions directive.  We will obviously have to reconsider these matters given the implications of Brexit.  While I welcome that we have finally opted in to this directive, albeit belatedly, it really behoves the Minister to come up with a better interim solution than the inadequate one he is proposing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300037#LL00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516735200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>It was Tony Benn who said that the way a government treats refugees is very instructive because it shows how it would treat the rest of us if it thought it could get away with it.  That is true, but it is a horrifying thought to think that the rest of us would be put in what, for those living in them, are open air prison camps where people have very little autonomy and very little control over their lives.  People in such places have, until now, had no right to access work.  They are struggling to get by on just over &euro;20 a week.  These people are prey to mental health problems, and the potential for exploitation exists.  It is an inhumane and barbaric system, and it is a stain on our society.<\/p>  <p>  I recently had a parliamentary question answered by the Minister which illustrated the power imbalance.  It related to a case in Limerick, and the fact that the centre that a person happens to stay in can simply tell a refugee that he or she is not staying there and is not using his or her bed.  One can dispute that but will have no access to an independent appeals process where his or her side of the story can be set out.  All of the power, unfortunately, lies with those who are not the asylum seekers.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome that we are signing up to this directive, but we should have signed up to it a very long time ago.  The reality is that the Government has been dragged, kicking and screaming, to do this.  The only reason it is doing this is that it is being forced by the Supreme Court to do it, and even then it is acting belatedly and in the most limited fashion possible.  The Minister knew about this.  He had notice about this since May.  Instead of acting then he has waited until now, when we are a couple of weeks away from the February deadline. <\/p>  <p>  The interim solution is extremely poor.  Refugees are not allowed access to some 60 occupations and have to have a job that pays more than &euro;30,000.  This will simply exclude a very big majority of asylum seekers.  In response, the Minister and the Government have said that it is a temporary measure and that they are working on something else.  The \"something else\" is still quite vague, as previous Deputies have referred to, and how limited it will be remains to be seen.  The key point is that direct provision was originally supposed to be a short-term solution, and this stain on our society, this barbaric system, still exists today.  People have to be given the right to access work fully.  Their rights to asylum and to stay in this country should be respected.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300038#MM00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1516735200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The 2013\/33EU directive seeks to guarantee a dignified standard of living for asylum seekers in the EU and to ensure that their human rights are respected.  We now have an extraordinary situation where we are guaranteeing the human rights of asylum seekers, but in the interim - we are not sure how long that will be - they will be barred from working in care work, as health professionals, in construction, retail, domestic work and hospitality.  The list of restricted occupations is shocking.  I would like to know what they can work at.  I have been making representations for almost a year to the Department of Justice and Equality for a Libyan man who was offered a job as a surgical consultant at Galway University Hospital but his application for a work permit has been refused by the Minister's Department and he cannot start that employment.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has finally told me that it has a policy of not employing Libyans except for those involved in aviation and the beef trade.<\/p>  <p>  We take an extraordinary attitude to human beings and to human labour.  We have said repeatedly in this House that with every hungry belly comes a pair of hands and a brain.  People have much to contribute to society, but they are being treated poorly.  They are told they can do one thing but not the other, and they can be imprisoned for 12 or 14 years.  The damage is being done to those who had hoped for so much when this Supreme Court ruling came out, and indeed those who had dared to hope when Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon issued his report.  I would love to know what he would say to the Minister about this measure today.  <\/p>  <p>  I am shocked by the vindictiveness of this and I cannot fathom why the Minister and his Department are taking these measures.  The only thing I can think of is that the Minister does not really respect or get the idea that refugees need refuge, and he has no problem punishing them for fleeing persecution and war.  It also might be a matter of sending a signal to low-paid workers in this country, to show them what is being done to protect them by not allowing refugees to compete against them for jobs.  I believe it is a combination of all of these things, and it is outrageous.  The brave Rohingya man who took the case to the Supreme Court in the first place may now ironically find himself unable to work in this country because he does not have &euro;1,000 and he cannot get a job outside of all of those listed industries which will pay him at least &euro;30,000 a year.

I was surprised that a rushed 40 minute debate was arranged for this evening.  I do not know how the decision was arrived at.  A more serious debate a little bit further down the road might have made more sense.<\/p>  <p>  This matter was debated for more than an hour at the Committee for Justice and Equality last week and many of the issues were teased out.  The opt-in is not the issue.  Everything else is.  As has been stated by others, if the Supreme Court had not made the ruling it is unlikely we would be acting on this yet.  We argued about the interim arrangement, which is totally ridiculous.  The notion that an asylum seeker is expected to pay &euro;1,000 for a permit to work for one year and to get a job that pays more than &euro;30,000 a year is, as we discussed at the committee, out of the question.  At least 99% of asylum seekers will not have an opportunity to work in that space.  As we pointed out to the Minister at the committee, we have a suspicion that, given the clarity of the Supreme Court decision, there is a very good chance the Government's position of not allowing these people direct access to work from 10 February this year is unconstitutional.  This may come back to bite it, but the State is very familiar with fighting avoidable legal battles.  <\/p>  <p>  The manner in which we have treated asylum seekers in this country is horrific.  In the Minister's defence he is not alone, given that 20 years ago asylum seekers had the right to work in Ireland, but it was taken away.  We introduced direct provision in 2000, so successive governments since have done nothing about it.  They changed nothing.  The length of time these people have spent living in these conditions does not bear thinking about.  Deputy Clare Daly and I have been in contact with a number of people in direct provision, in the past few months in particular.  These places are like refugee camps, to a degree, and I suspect the way we are organising them is part of the problem.  The State is paying more than &euro;60 million per annum for this.  That is a large amount of money.  We are outsourcing responsibility to private companies which are not treating well many of these asylum seekers in direct provision.  <\/p><p>I know some of them really well and I have some detailed descriptions of what is going on in the place, what the food is like, the arrangements for young people and what they have to go through in terms of shared space and God knows what else.  One of the bigger companies that has the contract here, and it is all being privatised, Aramark, is the largest prison catering company in the United States, and we know how they run their prisons.  Those guys are making a fortune in Ireland.<\/p> <p> A report was drawn up by Keelin Barry in 2014 into one of its units called What's Food Got To Do With It: Food Experiences of Asylum Seekers in Direct Provision.  To cite that report, quite a lot of people said their food was inedible or not palatable on any level.  Many people said the level of waste was disgraceful.  There was not enough fruit and vegetables, with high sugar and high fat content monotonous food.  Food was culturally inappropriate, bland, inedible and too salty.<\/p> <p> It is not easy to fix any of these issues but given that this problem has being going on for so long, the State should hang its head in shame in terms of the way we have dealt with asylum seekers.  I am sorry to say that while we will take in 4,000 over a period, we have not had a good approach across the board in this area.  We should be ashamed of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300038#MM00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516735800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>The first thing I would say to the Minister is that I do not blame him one iota for this situation.

I would not do that but I would say there is no point in looking backwards.  We have to look forward and be positive.  I am terribly sorry for the way these people have had to live.  I have dealt with them for many years in Killarney town and I always thought it was horrible to have healthy, fit, fresh people who wanted to work, to be part of our communities and to make a few euro for themselves but, unfortunately, our rules prohibited them from doing so.  My late father was always horrified at the idea of fine, fresh people being told that they can stay in their rooms, they will be given a few euro but they cannot go to work, despite the fact that there was plenty of work available for them.

The system of direct provision for asylum seekers is almost 18 years old and from the beginning, it has been a cause of significant controversy and debate.  Among the issues raised most recently are the duration of the stay in direct provision, the impact of that on family life, children, adults, spouses, siblings and so on, oversight and monitoring and the right to work.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Joint Committee on Public Services Oversight and Petitions stated that the system is not fit for purpose and recommended that it be replaced.  That is almost three years ago.  Why the delay?  From a humanitarian perspective, we are duty bound to offer whatever assistance we can to those genuinely in need of asylum and ensure that those who enter the direct provision system are treated with dignity and respect.  That is the very least we should do as a Christian country.  It is a duty of the State under any human rights charter, never mind international human rights charters, to look after people and give them a modicum of respect and dignity.<\/p>  <p>  I submitted a parliamentary question well over a year ago on this issue to the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality seeking the number of children who have been born to those in the direct provision system since its introduction in 2000.  I received a reply from the then Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, that the information I had requested is not readily available as it is not collated by either the Department of Justice and Equality or the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages.  That is outrageous.  Are we just locking them away behind closed doors?  Is it a case of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil?  It is unbelievable.  I am not blaming the then Minister of State for that but it is outrageous that we cannot tell the number of newborns in the centres.  I hope we can tell the number of adults in them.  It is scandalous and extraordinary, when one thinks about it.  Presumably, the children born to those in the asylum process are de facto part of that process, yet we have no data or numbers available.  That is shocking.  The number of asylum seekers accommodated on 31 December 2015 was 4,696, an increase of 332 persons or 7.6% on the same date in 2014.  This is the second year-on-year increase in seven years.<\/p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency spent &euro;57.025 million on accommodation for asylum seekers in 2015, an increase of 4.7% on 2014.  Therein lies the problem, and Deputy Wallace and others referred to it.  It is a gravy train for some unscrupulous so-called businessmen and entrepreneurs, and it is a shame.

For many years it has been need of reform because compared with neighbouring similar countries, we are remarkably negative and restrictive in our assessment of asylum applications.  Our percentages of refusals are a multiple of those in similar countries.<\/p>  <p>  The direct provision system is incredibly expensive in terms of the amount of money we have to spend.  Even the deportation process is unclear, not effective and deeply destructive to people who are caught in the middle of it in terms of their health and welfare.  We are implementing a system that is inhumane and wrong, as the Supreme Court recognised.  The delay in reacting to that Supreme Court judgment and the fact that we have a two-phase response without any real clarity in terms of the end point reflects that lack of priority, attention, concern and care within the Minister's Department regarding this issue.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to carry the public with us on this issue.  I believe the public are with us in recognising that the current direct provision system is wrong but we need to get people in the process working, and have the public with them on that.  <\/p>  <p>  I read the Minister's contribution in terms of the example of Syrian refugees.  He said that under the relocation they will be covered because their cases are determined within three months.  My experience of refugees within that programme is that they are not being determined within three months and they are being maintained in the same difficult system where their health and well-being are being undermined.<\/p>  <p>  The way we are introducing that scheme and working with it, in that their relocation will be to towns which almost by definition will not have huge employment opportunities, will make the problem worse.  We need to approach this not just in terms of how we get those refugees and others working but how we can introduce them into a community where everyone is working.<\/p><p>It would work in a kind of collective way with public support for what was being done.  We should use it as an opportunity to get public support for getting our asylum seekers working by engaging in a creative scheme where those towns which have been selected are given huge support to get employment working across the board.  It is that sort of innovative, creative big thinking that we need but we see none of it in what has happened over the past nine months or the years preceding them.  That needs to change.  While we support opting into the directive to help us do that, the Minister must use the interim period to be really ambitious about what we do and how we manage our asylum process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300039#NN00400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516736400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Technological Universities Bill 2015: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage","time":1516736400,"counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300040#OO00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516736400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 16:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1516736400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 32; N\u00edl, 33; Staon, 27.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Kathleen Funchion and Eamon Ryan; N\u00edl, Deputies Joe McHugh and Tony McLoughlin.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300040#OO00500","aye":["1330","1432","1252","1361","1279","1263","1316","1288","1317","1266","1320","1319","1353","1349","1239","1347","1362","1333","1226","1433","1340","1280","1302","1325","1215","1269","1287","1305","1366","1327","1294","1232"],"nay":["1246","1310","1293","1260","1241","1339","1285","1364","1261","1268","1356","1322","1264","1300","1233","1237","1249","1365","1314","1359","1290","1343","1247","1315","1328","1297","1267","1329","1265","1334","1304","1277","1358"],"abs":["1368","1321","1354","1220","1225","1350","1221","1217","1298","1274","1216","1289","1360","1311","1323","1224","1223","1248","1284","1283","1262","1257","1324","1312","1231","1344","1271"]},{"type":"speech","time":1516737000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 17 is in the name of Deputy Catherine Martin.

The seeking of additional members for any particular grouping, students or otherwise, would increase total membership.

The legislation regulates the profession of statutory auditor and the conduct of statutory audits.  The role of the statutory auditor is to review and certify the financial statements of companies or other entities that are obliged to have a statutory audit under EU law.  In the aftermath of the international financial crisis, the European Commission undertook to examine how the audit function could be enhanced in order to contribute to increased financial stability.  The outcome of that examination was the adoption in 2014 of new rules in the form of an EU directive and an accompanying EU regulation.  The directive builds on the 2006 audit directive and introduces significant reforms.  It is concerned with the approval and regulation of statutory auditors and the system of public oversight.  It also sets out the rules for the conduct of all statutory audits that are required by EU law.  The EU regulation then adds stricter rules for the audits of entities that have a particular position in the economy.  These are referred to as \"public interest entities\" and include entities such as banks, insurers, collective investment funds and companies that are listed on a regulated market.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, these rules were adopted in mid-2014 and the deadline for them to come into operation in Ireland was 17 June 2016.  Furthermore, as the EU regulation took direct effect in Irish law on that date, it was necessary to ensure that implementing measures were in place on time.  For these reasons, the essential elements of the EU rules were introduced into Irish law by way of statutory instrument Sl 312 of 2016.  Consequently, much of what is in the Bill before us has been in operation for over a year now.  However, the EU laws of 2014 presented us with options that are not necessitated, consequential or essential to the transposition of either the directive or the EU regulation.  Therefore, it was not possible to give effect to them in a statutory instrument.  However, the Government sees some of these options as desirable to further enhance the rules for statutory audit and the oversight framework.  Therefore, this Bill will replace the current statutory instrument, elevate its provisions to primary legislation, implement some of the options in the EU rules that could not be implemented in secondary legislation, and introduce some new measures that will enhance the system of public oversight.<\/p>  <p>  Before I go into the detail of the Bill, I would like to mention a few preliminary matters.  First, the Bill takes the form of an amendment to the Companies Act 2014.  Deputies will remember the major legislative project that led to that Act and the significant modernisation of company law that it introduced.  The Bill before the House makes amendments to Parts 6 and 15 of the 2014 Act.  The Bill also inserts a new separate Part, Part 27, to provide more specifically for the conduct of audits, the regulation of statutory auditors and the obligations on public interest entities.  As well as giving effect to EU rules, the Bill introduces some changes in respect of the rules governing the late filing of annual returns and the accompanying loss of the audit exemption.  The Bill removes the outdated term \"public auditor\" and replaces it with \"statutory auditor\" in the Statute Book.<\/p><p> The Bill is large, so I propose to deal with related sections together, highlighting anything new or significant.  Part 1 contains standard provisions to set out matters such as the Title, the commencement arrangements and repeals.  In Part 2, some sections are clearly technical, updating cross-references, introducing necessary definitions or giving effect to essential elements of the EU rules.  Section 7 implements an option in the EU directive that was not previously exercised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300044#SS06700","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516738800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 Second Stage: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1516738800,"counter":464,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300045#TT00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1516738800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>With the permission of the House, I will share time with Deputy Catherine Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300045#TT00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1516738800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Rents, as we know, are at record levels, with the average rent now at &euro;1,056.  The average rent in Dublin is now a shocking &euro;1,518.  In the past year, rents have risen practically everywhere.  They have risen by, for example, 21% in Limerick, 14% in Waterford and 13% in Westmeath.  These are all very strong cases for rent pressure zones.  They have also risen by 11% in Cork, where there is an existing rent pressure zone.<\/p><p>Overall, throughout the country rents have increased by 9.5% in the past year.  It is because of this that the Social Democrats have brought forward the Bill.  We believe the spiralling rents are directly responsible for the surge in homelessness.  These increases are simply unsustainable and lay bare the abject failure of a reliance on the market to ensure an adequate supply of appropriate housing for the population.  People are paying more money for poorer housing as the market contracts further and further, and desperate prospective tenants are left to trawl through shorter and shorter lists on websites such as <i>daft.ie<\/i>for any kind of liveable and affordable property.<\/p><p>In addition, I am sure every Deputy here this evening deals on an almost daily basis with families and individuals who are either becoming homeless, have been made homeless, are in emergency accommodation or are sleeping on the floors of family and friends.  These situations are a direct result of the failure of successive Governments to effectively ensure the delivery of sufficient housing in Ireland at an affordable price.  It is an issue that goes far beyond homelessness, but homelessness is one of the most tragic outcomes of this failure by the Government.  The failure to fund proper public house building programmes over the past number of years, along with the failure to control land prices for private sector housing, has resulted in the current crisis.  This, in turn, has put a particularly severe strain on the very poorly regulated rental sector.<\/p><p>We would all like to see a properly developed rental sector.  It would be a critical element of any housing strategy.  We know that in most other European countries there are strong rental sectors, but they are sectors where people are guaranteed affordable rent, where there are effective rent caps and where people are assured of security of tenure.  In such circumstances, long-term rental is a viable proposition for people in terms of providing for their housing needs.  Unfortunately, we are very far away from it in this country, and what we have are many accidental landlords.  Many of them were on the airwaves today raising issues about this legislation.<\/p><p>Rent controls are not about ensuring that people who may have become accidental landlords and are in negative equity are bailed out.  That is not what rent controls should address.  Rent controls are about ensuring people can access good quality rental accommodation at an affordable price.  Much work needs to be done on developing this type of long-term rental option for people if we are to ensure people have choice when it comes to the provision of housing.<\/p><p>It is hardly surprising that homelessness is at record levels.  According to Focus Ireland, there was a 17% increase in family homelessness over 2017.  As it stands today, 8,587 people in Ireland are officially homeless.  Of these, 36%, that is, 3,079, are children.  By any standard, this is a shocking indictment of the Government's housing policy.<\/p><p>The Government has long been promising to address the fundamental flaws in our housing sector, but progress has been painfully slow.  Why is it not a stated objective of Government to drive down the cost of housing and make housing affordable for all families whether buying or renting?  This has never been stated by the Government.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on this, given that housing is such a central part of people's lives.  It is the biggest single purchase that any of us make and it is critical to our welfare, health and well-being, yet the Minister seems to be prepared to stand by while so many people are forced into appalling housing circumstances or homelessness or, indeed, are put to the pin of their collar to put a roof over their heads.  It is a central responsibility of the Government to ensure people can access adequate housing in line with their budget.<\/p><p>I would like to hear the Minister coming out and saying it is an objective of the Government's housing policy to drive down house prices, but I have been waiting to hear that and we will be left waiting.  I have to ask, and I hope the Minister will answer the question for me in his contribution, why it is that the determination of the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, was to prioritise the recapitalisation of the banks and the bailout of property speculators has overridden a key responsibility of the Government, which is to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing for its people.  We all remember too well the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, when he introduced his help to buy scheme.  It was a stated intention of the scheme to stimulate demand and this, in turn, inevitably inflated house prices.  We have to ask, in terms of the previous Government and the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, in particular, who exactly was he serving as a Minister in Cabinet?  Was he serving his masters in the banks and some of his masters in the property development sector?  Was anybody in government taking their responsibility seriously in terms of ensuring people had access to decent housing?<\/p><p>We now have a population of 895,600 renters in this country.  That is 20% of our population living in the private rental sector.  Many are in very precarious positions, living in fear of a notice to quit from their landlords.  Increasingly, we see landlords seeking to use exemptions under the Residential Tenancies Act, whereby they can claim they are selling or refurbishing the property or moving in a family member to justify termination of a tenancy.  At present, the notice periods for tenants in this situation are extremely short.  It is these tenants who are the most vulnerable to homelessness, and these tenants who are the main focus of the Bill before us.<\/p><p>The Bill is structured as follows.  Section 1 deals with interpretation.  Section 2 provides for longer periods of notice for tenants when landlords are terminating a tenancy.  Section 3 provides that new tenants would have access to details of the amount of rent paid under the previous tenancy, to ensure the maximum increase for rents charged in rent pressure zones is applied correctly.<\/p><p>Section 4 raises the maximum fine that may be applied under section 9 of the Act from &euro;3,000 to &euro;15,000.  With rising rents, the penalties set down in the Act need to be raised in order to maintain an adequate deterrent.  Section 5 sets out the Short Title, collective citation and construction.<\/p> <p> The Bill provides for longer periods of notice for tenants when landlords are terminating a tenancy.  Currently, a very short minimum notice period is set down in legislation.  Tenants with less than six months in a tenancy are only entitled to 28 days' notice from the landlord.  Tenants resident for between six and 12 months are only entitled to 35 days.  In the current climate, where there is a severe housing shortage, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for tenants and the housing services supporting them to find alternative accommodation in such a short space of time.  The short notice period is undoubtedly a factor in driving the surge in homelessness, as people are simply unable to source alternative accommodation in such a narrow timeframe.<\/p> <p> In a comparative sense, Ireland has very short notice periods for tenants who have been residing in a property for less than five years.  Notice periods were improved under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 but only for those resident in a property for five years or longer.  We want to change this.  This Bill would extend notice periods for termination of tenancies by landlords so all tenancies under one year's duration would require a 90-day notice period, with tenancies of between one and five years requiring 120 days' notice.  The proposed change would amend section 66 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and provide an important extra protection for tenants to prevent homelessness.  This change would bring us into line with other European countries where renting is more common.<\/p> <p> According to a report commissioned by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, the minimum notice period in the Netherlands is between three and six months, depending on how long the tenant has been in residence.  The landlord may only seek a termination in certain circumstances, including if it is needed for the landlord's family or a family member's use, if the property is to be sold or if the tenant has broken the terms of the contract.  In some cases, landlords may have to cover some of the tenants' moving costs.  Conversely, in Sweden it is very difficult for a landlord to terminate a lease, even when strong grounds are cited.  In some cases where the landlord wishes to renovate the premises, he or she may have to provide alternative accommodation.  In a comparative sense, Irish landlords have a huge degree of autonomy to terminate leases at will.<\/p> <p> The vast majority of landlords respect their tenants and treat them fairly.  We seek to amend the existing legislation and not punish landlords; rather, our objective is to ensure that landlords act within the law and that tenants can have sufficient time to make arrangements to move out, with a chance to find alternative accommodation to rent without being at risk of having nowhere to go.  This is a reality for far too many people in Ireland today and one of the primary pathways into homelessness for individuals and families.  An unexpected tenancy termination turns into prolonged couch-surfing, which in turn often leads to homeless services.  The proposed changes are not onerous or punishing, despite the reaction from some landlords today to this Bill.  In the current climate, where there is a severe housing shortage, it is very difficult for tenants and housing services to source suitable alternative accommodation within 28 days.<\/p> <p> As has been pointed out, this section of the Bill will not address the supply issue for housing.  That is correct, and the ball is very firmly in the Government's court when it comes to improving supply.  We are seeking to ensure families and individuals can be given a proper and fair chance, with adequate time, to find new accommodation in what is a very volatile housing market.  We want to ensure all the information and supports are available to these people.  As Focus Ireland commented with respect to the Bill, these steps provide those at risk of homelessness or exploitation with time and information.  Focus Ireland knows from its work with families and individuals that to prevent homelessness, time and information are the two most important tools.<\/p> <p> There are other proposals in the legislation before us that I will speak to later.  They relate to ensuring tenants have access to data on people in the accommodation prior to their tenancy and increasing penalties.  I will now give way to my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, but I urge Members on all sides of the House to support this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300045#TT00600","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516739400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>We are seeing quite significant changes in how people in Ireland live and work but the two cannot be separated when it comes to housing.  Contract rather than permanent employment, for example, means lending institutions are not providing mortgages, and even when the income is sufficient, the choice of home ownership for some is simply not available.  That is before we even consider more precarious forms of employment.  We know there has traditionally been a very high home ownership rate in Ireland but that is changing.  The Central Statistics Office report from 2016 indicates the number of owner-occupied households fell from 69.7% to 67.6%, a rate last seen in 1971.  However, when aggregated by age, the results indicate renting was more common than owning before the age of 35.  Beyond this, more householders owned rather than rented their home.  This might change, depending on the type of employment available in future.  That is another day's work.  The equivalent age in previous censuses was 32 years in 2011, 28 years in 2006, 27 years in 2002 and 26 years in 1991.  We can see in the years when family formation primarily occurs or where people desire to live independently, the option that is the one most relied on is renting.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is about the immediate but it is also about the future.  Renting in all its forms will continue to play a bigger role than in previous decades and we must respond to this by developing a rental sector that works for both tenants and landlords.  A critical element in this regard is a well-regulated sector, with a regulator that has teeth and where disputes are dealt with in a timely way.  What exists now falls very far short of that.  One of the main reasons we had a high rate of home ownership is because people, particularly those with children, wanted certainty in their lives that the house they lived in was their home and not just someone else's property.  The question is how we achieve that for renters.  How do we achieve a longer-term rental sector that assures security of tenure and where landlords are still happy to belong to it?<\/p>  <p>  Like all other Deputies in an area that is described as a pressure zone, the number one issue coming through my door for at least five years has been housing.  It has always been there but it has now changed.  I see people every week and have done so for more than five years now who will say they never thought this would happen to them.  These are functioning families, no different from their next-door neighbours, but they are facing homelessness.  The first concern is to find alternative accommodation and, in most cases, the primary concern will be for the children, to keep them in school and connected with their friends and after-school activities.  It is about keeping things normal and ensuring their stress is not transferred to their children, even though in most cases these people are cracking up.  I have a box of tissues on my desk and it is used all the time, invariably by people who come to me about housing.<\/p>  <p>  There are in excess of 90,000 applicants on housing waiting lists; I stress that these are \"applicants\" rather than individuals, so a conservative estimate would have approximately 250,000 people on the lists.  The criteria for qualifying for social housing includes income thresholds.  These are households that cannot afford to buy and which in so many cases are supported by the housing assistance payment, HAP.  This is an expensive option that is unsustainable in the medium to long term.<\/p><p>There is no escaping the need for large scale building of social housing.<\/p> <p> We proposed the establishment of a housing delivery agency in our manifesto in 2016.  We see its role primarily as a project management agency that would control State-owned lands and would aim to achieve efficiencies in the cost of delivering houses for rent and for sale.  Efficiencies would occur when the scale increases so it is about building mixed communities with a variety of house size.  The agency would have a role in seeking planning permission.  Given the certainty that would create, it would be an attractive option for the building sector.  Perhaps a collaboration of small and medium-sized building firms could be involved.<\/p> <p> This Bill is not aimed at replacing responsibilities.  It is focused on both the short and the longer term.  We must recognise that there is a fundamental change and we must move with that change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300046#UU00200","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516740000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Shortall and Catherine Murphy for bringing this Bill forward and for providing us with another opportunity to discuss the development of the rental sector, which is a priority for the Government.  I acknowledge the substance of the Bill and its genuine motivation to improve the situation for tenants at a time of under-supply in the residential rental sector.  It also addresses some issues that will be covered in forthcoming legislation that is a priority for my Department.  The Government will not oppose the passage of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill raises some issues that have been considered and addressed in recent legislation and in the Government's strategy for the rental sector, which was published in December 2016.  The rental strategy sets out the Government's vision for a strong, viable and attractive rental sector, supported by a policy and regulatory framework that delivers long-term, affordable and high quality accommodation solutions to meet diverse tenants' needs and a secure, predictable investment environment for landlords and accommodation providers.  The rental strategy contains 29 actions aimed at achieving improvements in respect of security, standards, services and supply in the residential rental sector.  Implementation of the strategy is well under way with many rental reforms already introduced and in train.<\/p>  <p>  A number of targeted measures and initiatives have been announced with the aim of providing better security of tenure, higher accommodation standards and greater rent certainty for tenants, as well as enhancing the supports and services available to landlords to facilitate the development of a more vibrant and sustainable rental sector.  These initiatives include the establishment of rent pressure zones in areas of high and rapidly rising rents; the introduction of new rental accommodation standards; new legislative protections for tenants where multi-unit developments are being sold; the strengthening of the role and powers of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to provide its services more effectively such as through accelerated dispute resolution processes, empowering tenants and landlords, and developing a one-stop-shop within the RTB to improve access to information for tenants and landlords.  Of course, more must be done.  Policies can always be improved and implementation of those policies must be driven.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, I outlined, last September, a list of further actions to be pursued to broaden further the role of the RTB - for example, a move towards annual registration of tenancies would provide more accurate and detailed data on the rents being charged - as part of a two-year change management plan for the agency.  A key commitment is the planned new provision to make it an offence where landlords implement rent increases that contravene the law.  The RTB will be given the powers to investigate and prosecute landlords who implement such increases.  The onus will no longer be exclusively on the tenant to act.<\/p>  <p>  Rising rents have not been left unchecked.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party Government introduced amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act in December 2015 to double the minimum period between rent reviews to 24 months.  This measure will apply until 2019.  The current Government built on this by introducing an annual rent increase cap of 4% in rent pressure zones.  The 2015 Act also increased significantly the minimum period of notice of new rent from 28 days to 90 days and significantly lengthened the minimum notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to section 3 of this Bill, I am happy to advise Members that under section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Act, as amended by section 33 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, when the rent is being set for a new tenancy in a rent pressure zone, the landlord is obliged to inform the tenant of the previous rent paid for the property and the time at which it was set.  The tenant or prospective tenant concerned is also able to see the previous rent and any rent increase being proposed and assess whether the rent being sought is in line with the legislation.  If a tenant thinks he or she is being charged more than he or she should be in accordance with the law, the tenant can raise the issue with the RTB.  In addition, there is valuable comparison data available on the RTB's website.  The RTB's quarterly rent index provides rental data information from all rents registered with it during each quarter, based on the actual rents paid, the location, six categories of dwelling types, accommodation size, number of occupants and tenancy length.  These reports provide tenants with a general picture of rents by which they can determine if the rent proposed is broadly in line with market rents in the area.  Access to rental data as well as rent transparency for specific rental properties is being further considered in the context of drafting the Government's forthcoming Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill and of the RTB's change management plan which was announced last September.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 provides for significant increases in the range of minimum notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords as they apply to shorter tenancies.  The current graduated notice periods were prescribed in December 2015 and implemented a recommendation in a 2014 report on the future of the private rental sector, which was commissioned by the RTB.  The 2015 provisions introduced the current graduated notice periods as they apply to tenancy terminations by landlords for tenancies of five or more years duration.  While the current graduated notice periods have been in place for a relatively short time, the length and notice periods for longer-term tenants appear to be working well.  However, having regard to this Bill's proposals relating to extended notice periods for shorter-term lettings, I will reflect on these points in the context of developing the Government's residential tenancies Bill, which is being drafted for publication during this term, cognisant of the impacts on, and needs of, both tenants and landlords.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand the need for balance as we address these proposals.  The majority of landlords only own one property.  The vast majority of landlords are good landlords who are providing a service that people want and need.  It is important that further analysis be carried out on the potential impacts of substantially increasing the notice periods to ensure there are no adverse consequences which might deter new landlords from entering the rental market or drive existing landlords from the sector.  It is equally important that there are no unintended consequences that might see a sudden surge of notices issued out of fear of what might be perceived as a hasty move to new conditions that are too restrictive for the landlord to continue as a landlord.  While the acute pressures in the rental market mean we must manage the inflation of rent prices in the short term, ultimately the most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the medium to long term, and benefit the entire sector, is to increase supply and accelerate the delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors.  That is what we are doing under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the other section in the Bill before us, it might be useful to outline briefly the current penalties that apply to anybody guilty of an offence under the Residential Tenancies Act.  On summary conviction of an offence, a class B fine with a maximum of &euro;4,000 applies or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.  If after the summary conviction the offence continues, a further offence is committed under the Residential Tenancies Act on each day that such action or inaction continues.  The maximum class E fine of &euro;500 can be applied to each further offence.  If, for example, a landlord persists with an offence for one month following his or her initial summary conviction, a further penalty of &euro;15,000 will quickly clock up.  The quantum of the maximum fine proposed in this Bill will be quickly reached under the current law.  The Fines Act 2010 under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality provides for the payment of fines and the default of fine payments, including the publication of a list of names of persons who do not pay fines on time.  However, I have asked my Department and the RTB to re-examine the scale of the penalties applying to offences under the Residential Tenancies Act in the context of developing the Government's residential tenancies Bill which is currently being drafted and is a priority for the Department.  I have also asked them to look at what might potentially be described as criminal acts under those legislative changes.<\/p>  <p>  Developing the rental sector is an important goal for the country.  In doing this, it is paramount that we avoid unintended consequences of new Government measures.  It will continue to be important to balance the rights and responsibilities of both landlords and tenants.  The vast majority of small independent landlords are good landlords.  They look after their accommodation and their tenants.  The Government in its work will continue to enhance the protections under the Residential Tenancies Act and to invest in the services provided by the RTB and Threshold.  True housing security for people in the long term must be delivered.  All parents wish to be sure that they do not have to uproot their families from their community, schools and familiar environment.  This is not just about parents.  We all accept that homelessness is particularly difficult for children.  Familiarity and community are important.  They are settling and a type of personal security, particularly when one is young.  Furthermore, developing a more mature and modern rental sector requires introducing affordable rental schemes, as we are doing, as well as incentivising the development of thousands more homes for rent, which we are doing through our new build to rent guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the rent predictability measure is a priority for the Government.  When passing the relevant legislation in December 2016, Members will recall that both Houses extensively discussed and reached decisions on the issues and options involved.  The rent predictability measure is being implemented and currently covers a majority of private tenancies in the country.  I accept that some legal enhancements are necessary to enforce its implementation.  That is the clear focus of the legislative measures currently being developed by my Department following the public consultation and review of the rent predictability measure last autumn.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has given priority to the early publication of a Bill during the current Oireachtas term to address rent issues and Deputies will have the opportunity to propose and discuss any new ideas in that regard.  I will be asking my officials to reflect on the proposals outlined in this Private Members' Bill to see whether and how to best address these concerns.  In light of this, I do not oppose the Second Reading of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300047#VV00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516740600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I will also be supporting the Bill, which I welcome, on Second Stage.  It is opportune because, as the Minister stated,the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which contained provisions for minimum notice periods, the creation of rent pressure zones, the capping of increases within those zones to 4% and the limitation of rent reviews to every two years, was introduced in December 2016 and the Government and, in particular, the previous Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, said there would be a review of its workings but that has not yet been seen by Members.  He said the commission on taxation would feed into the budgetary process regarding incentives and initiatives to retain landlords and encourage more landlords into the marketplace but that has not been seen by Members either.  There have also been commitments over a long period of time to provide for an adequate inspection regime.  However, considering that there are only approximately 65 such workers across the country for 325,000 rental properties, the failure to deliver on that commitment is also disappointing.  Any such measures or incentives that would retain landlords in the sector and encourage more into it would yield a return which is needed in the short term because of the terrible vista and crisis with which we are faced.  In the absence of that having been done, I support the Bill as proposed and, no more than any other Member, will allow it to pass Second Stage and move on to Committee Stage.  I hope the Government will get its act together in the meantime and be in a position to bring meaningful amendments to the Bill in order to honour the commitments it made at this time last year.<\/p>  <p>  My party and I realise the need for immediate initiatives and interjections in the marketplace because the current cost of rent, often upwards of &euro;2,000 in cities, cannot be sustained.  Nobody in this day and age who wishes to provide for him or herself and a family should have to pay such exorbitant rates.  We have always bought into the theory that nothing will happen overnight.  How many years has the current Government been in power?  As I said yesterday and many others said today at a conference organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and attended by many Members, supply is the key to affordability and cost is the key to supply.  The Government, despite its commitments in the programme for Government and the confidence and supply agreement to take away barriers to the construction sector such as cost, development charges, certification costs, cost of finance and VAT, has made no attempt to address those issues.  In the absence of any such attempts or the provision of affordable or social schemes along the lines that Members expected, we are faced with this dilemma and I, and many like me throughout the country, meet in our constituency offices the poor, unfortunate people faced with the terrible vista of a landlord telling them there are relations home from the United States or Australia who need the house, or the landlord wishes to make substantial changes and alterations to the house and, hey presto, the tenant is out on the street.  We have asked on several occasions for a greater definition and qualification of \"substantial alterations\".  That was committed to by the Government but not acted upon.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that the Government, in allowing the Bill through Second Stage, will give a commitment as to when it will be heard on Committee Stage and when the Government will be able to respond to the Bill and live up to the commitments it has made.  I have not seen the report of the commission on taxation and have no knowledge of what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, considered in his negotiations on foot of that report.  The commitment in that regard was originally given by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, during his time in office.<\/p>  <p>  Some 70% of landlords own just one rental property and many are involuntary landlords.  There have been no initiatives on the waiving of commercial rates for over-the-shop developments where conversion to residential use could be forthcoming.  There has been no initiative to assist with the reduction of local property tax measures to help the industry.  In his pronouncement yesterday, the Minister referred to affordable rent schemes.  For how long have Members been crying out for such a scheme and expected movement in that area?  We have yet to see such movement but yesterday there was talk of pilot schemes that may ensue in the coming weeks and months.  We should have a blanket scheme across the country in that regard at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing has been done regarding the revision of the repair and lease scheme that has been an abject failure.  I do not think there have been any recent drawdowns from that scheme.  Indications of its potential failure were recognised eight, nine or ten months ago but there has been no progress in that regard.  There have been many announcements and pronouncements and many considered, small steps but a lack of urgency, initiative and effort to overhaul the system or bring about new thinking and ways and methods.  As I have been saying for quite some time, conventional methods have abysmally failed over the past six years but they are being persisted with.<\/p>  <p>  I made a contribution today, as did Deputies Bailey, Boyd Barrett and &Oacute; Broin, among others, to a housing conference.  Many experts were in attendance, as, as has been the case at various housing conferences over the past number of months, and everybody present at the conference shared a frustration that we have not seen the sort of progress that we thought might emanate from the all-party committee that sat in this Oireachtas and fed into the Rebuilding Ireland programme and provided many credible proposals and suggestions that had the support of all parties and none, some of which were taken on board but many of which were not.  The Rebuilding Ireland document was acknowledged as a programme that was well undertaken, well meant and well informed, considering the consultation process that took place, but we always said implementation was key.  Unfortunately, the figures do not lie and the terrible failures are evident for everybody to see in so far as when affected people come to our constituency offices there is no house building programme to which we can point and say that there has been progress in the relevant county and there will be more progress.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister this week met with the CEOs of local authorities and county managers he stated that targets will now be put in place.  I have no problem with measuring success in respect of those targets when they are published but I would have hoped, as I said to the Minister last week in the Customs House, that we would also measure failures and be honest and frank about them.  How many people were on the waiting lists of each local authority on 1 January 2016?  How many houses were built by each local authority and how many purchased in that year?  How many houses were built by approved housing bodies?  How much land had local authorities available during that year?  At the end of the year, how many people were on their waiting lists?  If that information was available for every local authority for 2016, 2017 and 2018 we would see the wastage in respect of land and the lack of urgency on the part of either the local authorities, the Department or the Minister who is driving them.  It is high time we identified where the deficiencies lie.<\/p>  <p>  We have been told on many occasions that the eight-step process in respect of procurement from when a site is identified to when it is built on, which is often three or four years later, has been reduced to four.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300048#WW00200","speaker":"1217"}]
