A plethora of issues and challenges for young people's health, such as the obesity crisis, are emerging these days.  Dental health is just as much an essential issue when it comes to ensuring the future well-being of our citizens.  As we all know, dental complications can lead to serious illness and disease.  If the Government is serious about children and their health, it must ensure that dangers are minimised, not just for patient health but also for the savings this could bring to the cost of dental services provision in the longer term if problems are detected and dealt with at an earlier stage.<\/p>  <p>The State provides free dental services to persons under 16 years of age.  Parents should be able to expect their children's teeth to be examined in second, fourth and sixth class.  However, with delays in dentist visits, many children may not be seen until they are 11 or 12 years of age.  By that stage, the priority will be orthodontic work.  Seeing a dentist for the first time at 12 years of age or so could be too late to stop major problems with decay and gum disease.  It is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted.  Reductions in staff and funding have led to cutbacks in the service in recent years.  In my county, Cavan, this has been an issue of grave concern to many families.  The local council has raised the issue with the HSE on several occasions.  Collectively, counties Cavan and Monaghan are three to five years behind other counties in terms of dentists visiting primary schools.  This is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>Even though there are supposed to be screening programmes and services for persons under 16 years of age, the reality is that this is not happening.  The plight of children and young adults with dental disease is being exacerbated by this failure of the HSE to meet its obligations to children to provide primary school dental services.  The failure to provide timely screening and treatment of simple problems or early onset of dental disease causes severe deterioration which then requires more complex remedial treatments.  The State services often cannot provide these and many families simply cannot afford them, particularly given current economic circumstances.  This is the reality.<\/p>  <p>From previous ministerial responses to this issue when raised by other Deputies and Senators, I understand that a three-year project is under way to develop a new national oral health policy.  It has been acknowledged that despite the introduction of the 1994 dental health action plan, inequalities remain in the population's oral health.  The vulnerability of some groups linked to low income or disabilities is of particular concern.  The severe delays in dentists visiting primary schools are having a very detrimental effect on children's oral health in their formative years.  Why are there such delays and problems with dentists visiting primary schools and what is being done to address this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500002#A00300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  Dental services for children up to 16 years of age and persons of all ages with special needs are provided by the public dental service of the HSE.  These services are provided through its dental clinics throughout the country.  All HSE dental clinics ensure emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged 11 to 13 years.  This includes referral for orthodontic services where necessary.  Other services, including screening of children aged six to eight years, are provided where possible.<\/p>  <p>Following the successful recruitment of a general dental surgeon in October 2014 and a dental nurse in November 2014, the HSE public dental service is now able to operate across all locations in Cavan and Monaghan.  There were particular difficulties in Virginia, County Cavan, and in Monaghan, but these have recently been addressed.  The dental clinic at Castleblayney was decommissioned several years ago as part of network area reforms.  This coincided with a reduction in dental surgeons employed across the Cavan and Monaghan area between the end of 2006 and 2010, including the loss of a dental surgeon at Castleblayney.  Retirements, including the early retirement of the dental surgeon in Ballybay in 2011, added to the pressures on the service.  Despite these severe difficulties, a level of dental service was maintained and provided at Ballybay and Carrickmacross into 2014.  A new dental team was recruited and routine dental services resumed at Carrickmacross in October 2014.  With a dental nurse member of the new dental team assuming duties in November 2014, routine services at Ballybay are once again being provided.  The service, which is based in the dental clinic in the health centre in Ballybay, caters for the Ballybay and Castleblayney areas, for a number of national schools and also provides emergency care to eligible adolescents aged up to 16 years of age attending secondary schools in Ballybay and Castleblayney.  To date the service has been following up on recall-review appointments and providing emergency care.  Service frequency is two to three days a week, Monday to Wednesday, inclusive.<\/p>  <p>The service has arrears to deal with concerning children aged 11 to 13 who were in sixth class in the school year 2013-2014.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, screening is being completed in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, and arrangements are being made to commence screening of such children in Virginia, County Cavan.  It should be noted that the HSE public dental service in the Cavan-Monaghan area is not merely a school dental service as the service remit includes dental paediatric specialist care in Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan hospital, for children with special needs who are medically compromised.  It also includes a dental general anaesthetic service at Cavan General Hospital for routine paediatric extraction cases, paediatric services and adult special care, oral health promotion service and care for adults with special needs.<\/p> <p>I wish to assure the Senator that the HSE is committed to continuing to address the service challenges in providing these important primary care services in Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500002#A00400","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is replying on behalf of her colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.

I acknowledge that I am speaking about a very small cohort of the population but they use the road along with all the other drivers.<\/p>  <p>I know of two constituents, one of whom has completely lost a limb and the other who cannot use his right leg.  They both drive specially adapted cars.  Can the Minister of State imagine if he had to drive an adapted car with his left leg for the rest of his life and he had permission to drive even though he might never have had to use his left leg to drive?  It is a very different experience for the brain to have to use the left leg as opposed to the right leg or to use hand controls in the case of a person with no legs.  The driving licence gives such a person full permission to drive.

I thank Senator O'Brien for raising this issue.  There is universal agreement that safety should be the highest priority in all areas of transport.  When it comes to safety on our roads, we have to consider a range of factors which may contribute to - or endanger - the safety of road users.  One of the most important factors is the capacity of the driver behind the wheel.<\/p>  <p>Driver licensing exists to ensure there is a standard of driving which is required of people driving on our roads.  Skills and experience are vital.  As part of the overall concern which we must have for driver qualifications, we have to recognise that medical factors can and do have an impact on the ability to drive.  The legislative framework for medical fitness to drive is set at EU level.  Under this framework, drivers are required in certain circumstance to notify the national driver licensing service of particular medical conditions which might impact on their driving.  In cases where people who are already licensed to drive, suffer an injury or develop an illness which may impact on their driving, they are required to notify the NDLS, and also their insurance provider.  There is also a responsibility on medical professionals to advise patients if an illness or injury will have an impact on their driving.  Dangerous driving is a serious offence and it is important that drivers with medical conditions which might impact on their driving are aware of this.<\/p>  <p>Last year, the Road Safety Authority published a detailed set of guidelines on health and fitness to drive entitled, Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines.  This document is on the RSA's website and it is highly recommended.  This document sets out in detail the responsibilities of drivers, health care professionals and the NDLS in relation to health factors and driving.  This includes the correct approach in cases of injury.<\/p>  <p>Current practice requires the health care professional to inform the patient of an impact to his or her driving as a result of a medical or physical condition.  Where appropriate - as it would be in the case of a loss of limbs - an assessment will be made as to whether the individual would be fit to drive with certain vehicle modifications, and what modifications would be appropriate.  A GP may look for specialist opinion including that of an occupational therapist to be assured that any disability resulting from the loss of a limb or the loss of function can be mitigated so that the person can continue to drive.<\/p>  <p>In cases where a vehicle modification is required, the NDLS must be notified.  There are several codes which can be marked on a licence to indicate the modifications which are required and the appropriate code will be added to the person's licence.  The Minister is satisfied that the current is system is working well and that there is no need for the mandatory retesting suggested by the Senator.  However, he is willing to retain an open mind and if evidence were to suggest that policy needed to change, he would of course consider it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500003#B00500","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I thank the officials in the Department for taking the trouble to put together a very good reply.

As the Minister of State, no doubt, is aware, under the current rules a person who works for three full days a week is entitled to payment for two days of jobseeker's allowance whereas a person who works for one or two hours a day for five days a week is not entitled to any jobseeker's payment.  Is it not reasonable and fair that a person who works eight hours a week should be considered to have worked the equivalent of a full day and is entitled to four days of jobseeker's payment?<\/p>  <p>A mother who is a leader in my community in Tallaght west contacted me on this issue.  I know her personally, she is an extraordinary leader and volunteered at board level with An Cos&aacute;n, the organisation in west Tallaght with which I am associated.  She has been working part-time for 12 years, for nine hours a week.  She was allowed to supplement her one-parent family payment with her earnings from her part-time work, but since her child is now over 18 years, she no longer qualifies for the one-parent family payment.  She needed to register for the jobseeker's allowance and was initially disqualified, as many other women are, because she was working five days a week although she only worked nine hours.  Her nine hours of part-time work were spread over five days.  As a consequence she has had to give up her part-time work to receive jobseeker's payment.  Even for one woman, that is a tragedy, not to mention the significant number of women this is impacting on now and will impact on in the future.  Is this rule beneficial:?  Will it help to get her into full-time employment or halt her progress towards full-time employment?  I am afraid that in Ireland the three-day rule regarding part-time work simply does not correspond to the reality of people's - women's - opportunities to participate in the labour market and the characteristics of part-time work.  This is largely a women's issue, though I understand it impacts on men as well.<\/p>  <p>The labour market is changing and especially women's access to employment has become more fragmented with lower pay, fewer hours and less job security, a key point made by Professor Jill Rubery at the recent ESRI Geary lecture.  Many women who were previously in receipt of the one-parent family payment do not qualify now as their children are over 14 years of age and do not qualify for the payment of the jobseeker's transitional payment.  There are major barriers to re-entering full-time employment after a significant period spent outside of it.  There should be supports available for these women to re-access the labour market rather than restrictions to accept work.  I imagine that the T&aacute;naiste, in particular, is very keen on these issues.<\/p>  <p>I believe that part-time work provides a positive attachment to the labour market and hence should not be discouraged among long-term jobseekers who are genuinely seeking full-time employment.  This is impacting on thousands of women and some men throughout the country.  I would appreciate the Minister's consideration for the issue and an update if any review has taken place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500004#C00200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  The jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  The 2015 Estimates for the Department of Social Protection provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers' schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four in any period of seven consecutive days, so a person working more than three days a week will not qualify.  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  This is an important policy issue for the Department of Social Protection but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications for the jobseeker's schemes.<\/p>  <p>In 2011, the advisory group on tax and social welfare was established to harness expert opinion and experience to address a number of specific issues around the interaction of the tax and social protection systems.  The group was also tasked with examining how the social welfare system can best achieve its goals of supporting persons through periods of involuntary unemployment, while incentivising work and disincentivising welfare dependency.  Subsequently the T&aacute;naiste asked the group to broaden its remit to include issues relating to atypical working patterns.  In the course of its work the group looked at the current system which, in allowing people to work on three days a week and still get welfare support, is a very significant support to the functioning of the labour market and those who work part-time.<\/p>  <p>In this area it is often argued that the schemes should move to a system where hours, half-day, income levels, or a combination thereof, are used for measuring the level of employment engaged in by scheme recipients.  It is suggested that such alternative approaches have the potential to offer greater support to the small numbers of workers whom the current system cannot accommodate.<\/p>  <p>On the other hand it may be argued that if such changes increased the flexibility of the system and allowed greater levels of access to income support, counterbalancing measures would have to be introduced to protect the integrity and fiscal sustainability of the jobseeker's schemes.  Such measures could have the effect of removing support from a much larger cohort of workers.  For example, if the current system of allowing three days of work in any seven days were replaced by an hours-based system, then the threshold for access to the schemes could not be 24 hours as this could significantly increase claim numbers and cost.  However, any move to an hours-based system with a threshold of less than 24 hours could disenfranchise claimants currently working for three days.<\/p>  <p>Another issue of note would be the effect of any change on labour market practice.  The jobseeker's schemes play a very important role in supporting persons to gain a foothold in the labour market and we must ensure that any development of the system continues to support people to sustainable, full-time jobs rather than facilitating any erosion of job quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500004#C00300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Does the Senator have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500004#C00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1423132800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>What a disappointment.

Yes, it probably will cost, but on the other hand, it is currently costing the State, particularly for women who are moving from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's allowance in light of other changes the T&aacute;naiste has made.<\/p>  <p>It is important to incentivise work and there is no question about that.  We do not have enough time to argue the logic of the case put forward by the Minister of State, who argued that to calculate the time at work in hours rather than days will disincentivise people to work.

Having said that, is it correct that the advisory group on tax and social welfare is considering the issue and might come up with some better arguments as to why it should be calculated on the basis of hours rather than days?

This will bring to an end a 204-year history - going back to 1811 - of ferry services in which it was the main ferry port for embarkation to and arrival from the United Kingdom.  Like many of my generation and those before and since then, I had occasion to use the boat to England that went from D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Holyhead and then the train to Crewe, at which one changed for the train to London.

I was also interested to discover that originally Dunleary was the name of the area and it was only on the arrival of King George IV in 1820 that the good citizens of Dunleary decided to rename the town as Kingstown.  The Irish Free State then of course reverted to the original D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I worked in RTE for a long time and when I was there first, it had a pronunciation unit.  To this day, RTE people are the people who refer to that area as \"D&uacute;n Laoghaire\", whereas most people refer to it as \"Dunleary\".  There is a similar situation in Portlaoise, where most people who live there call it \"Portlaois\" but, according to RTE, it is \"Portlaoise\".<\/p>  <p>In addition, I wish to praise the Minister, Deputy Reilly, for holding firm against what seems to be an onslaught from Europe - I am sure the Leader will comment on this - in respect of standardised tobacco packaging.  The Seanad passed that legislation last year and I understand it is due to come before the D&aacute;il later this month.  I am glad to note the Minister is holding firm, despite what appears to be unprecedented opposition from at least ten European Union member states.  It goes to show what Senator Crown, a leading advocate of that legislation, said at the time it was introduced here to the effect that the tobacco industry is the enemy and is very well resourced.  It is obvious that the tobacco industry's lobbying skills have managed to have a great impact in a number of member states.  However, the fact that the United Kingdom and France are moving towards adopting similar legislation will strengthen our resolve.<\/p>  <p>Finally, I wish to bring up again an issue I raised earlier this week to which the Leader had responded positively, that is, the possibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, coming before the House.  As Members are aware, over the past 48 hours, he has been referring to the strong relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland and about the fears people in this country have about the possibility, on foot of the holding of a referendum after the elections in the United Kingdom, of the United Kingdom exiting from the European Union.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister is visiting Scotland today because I believe we have somehow undervalued the historic relationship between Scotland and Ireland.  As the North of Ireland is in one sense a shared jurisdiction in terms of a shared interest in which Scotland has a strong historical role, that visit is particularly significant and I welcome it.  My original request was about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, which has been escalated even further by the US Defence Secretary-in-waiting saying he is \"inclined\" towards supporting Ukraine with arms.  I consider that to be an escalation that is not helping in any way towards a peaceful resolution in that troubled area.  However, when the Leader is communicating with the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, in this regard, it would be an opportunity for the Minister both to give an outline of the Irish position on the Russian sanctions and about the impending referendum on the European Union.  It would be an opportunity for the Minister to restate Ireland's position in this House - which I believe would be supported overwhelmingly by the Irish people - namely, that we would support continuing membership of the European Union by the United Kingdom if for nothing other than purely selfish reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500006#K00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1423134600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I join Senator Paschal Mooney in marking the Stena Line decision to close its D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Holyhead ferry link.

Certainly the growth of the cruise market in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has been very positive but it is none the less worth marking the end of an era in terms of that particular route.<\/p>  <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on EU developments in light of what appears to be an increased escalation of tension between Athens and the European Central Bank following the ECB decision announced last night after the meeting between Mario Draghi and the Greek Finance Minister on Greek bonds.  This is a situation that is developing day by day and I would like if we could have a debate on what it means for the European Union and Ireland.  As Senator Paschal Mooney has said, there are other developments in terms of the British referendum which would have a potential seismic change within the European Union.  In the coming weeks it would be good to have the Minister with responsibility for European affairs come to the House to debate these and other issues around the development of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>I thank all the colleagues who attended the briefing I hosted yesterday with the Irish Penal Reform Trust on spent convictions.  We heard some very eloquent testimonies from individuals whose criminal record has been a real difficulty, no matter how long in the past or how minor, because we still do not have spent convictions legislation in place in Ireland.  The Bill passed through the Seanad.  It was commenced in the D&aacute;il and completed Committee Stage there but is awaiting Report Stage due to Government amendments being drafted to ensure it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights, following a decision in a UK Supreme Court case.  I will certainly renew calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure the Bill completes its passage through the D&aacute;il without delay because there are many people in Ireland who are affected by this and who, due perhaps to very old and very minor convictions, are hampered in employment, education and travel prospects.  This is a matter of real concern and I thank colleagues who attended the briefing.<\/p>  <p>I commend the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who yesterday launched a new anti-bullying resource for primary schools.  Given the events of recent weeks at Col&aacute;iste Eoin, which Senator David Norris and I raised, it is great to see a national resource being rolled out for primary schools to tackle homophobic bullying and bullying generally.

I am sure we will return to it when speaking on the Bill next week, but I just want to mark the launch of that document.<\/p>  <p>I wish to note that tomorrow is international day of zero tolerance against female genital mutilation, FGM.  I spoke on this issue earlier this week in the House and noted that in Egypt we have seen the first ever conviction.

I was very struck and very disappointed to hear this news.  I have known this ferry for well over 60 years.  I know that it moved from Howth to D&uacute;n Laoghaire because of questions of the draught for the boats in the 1830s and now it is moving back into the city of Dublin.  The transport service is by boat but there were strong literary reverberations there.  In the opening of <i>Ulysses, <\/i>Stephen Dedalus looks out over the parapet of the tower at Sandycove and watches the mail steam packet rounding the harbour, and at the end of Brendan Behan's triumphant novel, <i>Borstal Boy<\/i>, when he comes back to Ireland, the first thing he sees on the mail boat are the seven fingers of the chimneys of the old Pigeon House sticking up over the horizon.  I remember the old boats, long before Stena, when it was the <i>Princess Maud<\/i>, that relic of the 1920s, the <i>Cambria <\/i>and the <i>Hibernia<\/i>.<i><\/i>My late uncle used that regularly and always had the same cabin 1A reserved for him.  I remember after Beeching's cuts in England my uncle wrote ahead to the crew to ask for his usual porters and the station master wrote back and said: &quot;Dear Colonel Fitz-Patrick, I am afraid that due to Dr. Beeching's cuts there is only one porter at crew.&quot;  My uncle wrote back and said: &quot;Due to the deprivations of my household and the fact that I no longer travel in the style to which I used to be accustomed, one porter will be quite sufficient.  I will expect him at the door of my carriage.&quot;<br\/><br\/>I wish to comment briefly on the question of Portlaoise and Maryborough and D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Kingstown.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire is D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  That was its original name and it was perfectly appropriate that it would go back to it after the British left here.  But Maryborough was built as a defensive force by bloody Mary, the Catholic queen, wife of Phillip II, and that was its original name.  I always think of it as Maryborough.  It is in my ancestral county of Laois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500007#L00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1423134600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I welcome this morning's announcement from the European Commission's winter economic forecast which predicts Ireland remaining as the fastest growing economy in Europe, with an announcement of a GDP growth of 3.5% which will exceed expectations this year.

The Senator is correct in that the cost went from &euro;560 million or &euro;570 million in 2000 to more than &euro;2 billion by 2010.  The good news comes from more recent figures.  In the past year or perhaps 2013 - I an awaiting clarification on that - the cost has decreased from &euro;2 billion per annum to &euro;1.8 billion.  Every other country in the European Union has also reduced its budget, despite having far lower costs for drugs.  We have seen a 10% reduction but it is not enough, so we have much work to do.

I got a note this morning from Nursing Homes Ireland indicating that there is now a requirement for overseas nurses to be used again because we cannot fill posts.  In fairness, the HSE is recruiting again, which is a very welcome development that is long overdue.  The problem is there are 325 people from overseas waiting to go on adaptation courses to get appropriate training for working in the Irish system.  My understanding is there are not sufficient places and these nurses cannot be accommodated, despite the major shortage of trained nurses in nursing homes in both the private and public sector.  I raised the issue in 2012.  There are nurses specially trained for the maternity, psychiatry and intellectual disability areas but we are not specifically training nurses for elderly care.  We need to change the focus and develop a course which accommodates this.  I ask for a debate with the Minister on the matter.

I used to listen to the sound of the foghorn from the boat as I went to sleep at night.  It is a very sad day for people living in the area.  I point out the work done by some of the local people in Glasthule to recognise the plight of the forgotten Irish, the people who left on the mail boat, as it was known, some of whom never returned.  Last year we had a very poignant reunion in D&uacute;n Laoghaire of people who came back from London, some from the likes of Cricklewood, who had never returned to Ireland.

This is an ongoing issue that is raised in these Houses.  Of particular concern is the manner in which the courts are dealing with personal debt and family home mortgages.  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 sought to address these issues by reforming bankruptcy law.  I have criticised that Act in the past as ineffective.  Concerns expressed by me and others in this House have been borne out by the low take-up of the debt packages of the Insolvency Service of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>Leaving aside that flawed legislation for the time being, I wish to focus today on those debtors who, for whatever reason, do not or cannot avail of a personal insolvency package under the provisions of the Act.  For these people, the deluge has started, with banks pursuing mortgage defaulters with vigour.  In Galway Circuit Court before Christmas, more than 70 cases were brought before the county registrar.  For debtors who invariably cannot afford legal representation, being dragged into court is a deeply stressful experience to add to the stress they are already under.  The court approaches debt and mortgage applications in the typical adversarial manner, with barristers in legal garb and with the county registrar and Master of the High Court seated on a dais sitting in judgment.  The affidavits are opened and personal details are read out.  Judgment orders, orders for possession and well-charging orders are moved.  While the county registrar and the master have the power to adjourn matters for two months regarding applications to the Insolvency Service of Ireland, many cases are not amenable to debt arrangements under the Act.<\/p>  <p>There is or can be a more humane way of dealing with personal debt in our courts.  The mechanism of less adversarial hearings that is found in the family law Act of 1996 should be used in personal debt cases.  That Act provides for case-management-style hearings to be conducted around a conference table, not in open court and not in formal court dress.  The county registrar presides over the hearing.  Using similar provisions to deal with personal debtors would reduce their stress and allow the possibility of exploring settlement without having to air personal financial details in open court.<\/p>  <p>I am asking for a debate on this and would like to hear what the Government thinks about it.  The proposal would not interfere with creditors' right of access to the courts or prevent them from claiming property that has secured a debt; it is aimed at debtors who are, in the main, unrepresented by lawyers and whose family home may be at risk.  They deserve better than a 19th century Dickensian courtroom experience.  There are humane ways of resolving personal debt without the humiliation of court hearings in public.

Despite lobbying against the legislation by some food industry groups, it will bring about transparency and allow people to make positive healthy choices in their lives.

It is not simply the case that if calories are posted on menus, there will suddenly be a total reduction in obesity levels but it is a further step that might help.  While the Government cannot, and should not, interfere directly in people's choices, such transparency and disclosure will allow people to make better food choices as part of the action against obesity.

It has been held up on Report Stage in the other House.  I understand amendments are being drafted to bring the Bill to a conclusion but I will inquire from the Minister for Justice and Equality when it is likely Report Stage will be completed in the D&aacute;il.  I am sure the amendments will then be referred back to this House.<\/p>  <p>Senator Naughton referred to the success of the Action Plan for Jobs and the creation of 50 additional jobs in Galway.  On the same theme, Senator Brennan mentioned the success of SalesSense International Limited, which will provide 100 new jobs in Dundalk.  These positive announcements are good and I hope they will be made on a daily basis this year.<\/p>  <p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of surveillance of communications between countries.  She tabled an Adjournment debate on that last year.  Perhaps she could seek an update through a Commencement debate on what is happening in that regard.<\/p>  <p>Senator Whelan commented on the availability of the Soliris drug to patients.  It costs &euro;450,000 annually per patient but it is essential.  Senator Burke along with the Senator Whelan raised the issue of the cost of drugs and asked for the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss what mechanisms he intends to put in place to reduce prices.  I will invite him to do so.<\/p>  <p>Senator O'Donnell raised the issue of the lottery regulator and she pointed out that, on 9 October last, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that Mr. Liam Sloyan had accepted the appointment as the first regulator of the national lottery, a position provided for in the National Lottery Act 2013 following an open recruitment process administered by the Public Appointments Service.  Mr. Sloyan took up his appointment on 17 November.  The functions of the regulator, a matter also raised by Senator Wilson, include ensuring the national lottery is run with due propriety, the interests of the participants in the lottery are protected, the long-term sustainability of the lottery is safeguarded; and revenues allocated to good causes should be as high as possible.  I wish him well with his task.<\/p>  <p>With regard to the people's forum in respect of Irish Water, I gave a comprehensive reply on that matter yesterday.  Section 7 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that it is a function of the Commission for Energy Regulation to establish the forum.  Departmental officials met CER officials to progress the establishment of the forum and the Department is preparing regulations to set out details of the forum.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will provide the draft regulations to the JOC for comment before finalising the composition the membership of that forum.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be providing the draft regulations to the joint Oireachtas committee for comment before finalising the composition of the forum's membership.  I hope I have answered the question.<br\/><br\/>Senator Burke discussed the need to develop courses specifically for care of the elderly.  I noted his points on training for nurses overseas.<br\/><br\/>Senator Wilson raised points about the lotto as well as Dr. Travers and his recommendations on the junior certificate.  In the past week or so, there have been long negotiations between the unions and the Department.  I hope that this matter will be solved in early course.<br\/><br\/>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the future of the greyhound industry.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, attended the House last year on that matter, but if we need to hold a further debate on it, by all means we will try to arrange for one.  Regarding the issue of emigration, which was also mentioned yesterday, it is good to see that companies are going to Australia to recruit Irish people to come back to Ireland.  This should be encouraged so that other companies would do likewise.  Unemployment has decreased to 10.5%, which is the lowest it has been in a long time.  I hope that it will fall to 9% in the next few years.  Obviously, 10.5% is still too high.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government is doing everything possible to create new jobs for our people in the country and to attract those who emigrated in recent years.<br\/><br\/>Senator Bradford raised the issue of voting rights for people abroad.  The Seanad reform group is also considering it.  We will try to arrange for a debate with the Minister.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mulcahy asked about child care facilities, a matter that Senator Keane raised last week.  He mentioned staff pay and educational requirements.  I will ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, to update the House on the issue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mullen called for a debate on debt and mortgages.  We will try to arrange such a debate in early course.<br\/><br\/>Senator Jim D'Arcy discussed diesel laundering and the contamination of waterways.  He referred to the cows coming home, but they might not do so if they drink water that has been contaminated by criminals, many of whom are former or current so-called republicans.  The importation of cigarettes and so on is causing major damage to the economy, given the loss of revenue.  These matters must be addressed and I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to update the House on mechanisms to combat diesel laundering.  Contamination from sludge is causing local authorities deep concern and additional costs.  Due to an <i>omert&agrave;<\/i>, people are intimidated and will not give evidence against those responsible.  It must be combated.<br\/><br\/>Senator Noone raised the issue of obesity, calorie counts on menus and better food choices.  She mentioned legislation that will be introduced next year.  We will have an opportunity to debate it comprehensively then.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mullins referred to the recruitment of 200 local authority staff to expedite the house building programme.  The Minister will attend the House next week to debate a Labour Party Private Members' motion on social housing and private rented accommodation.  He will update us on those matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500011#P00500","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423137600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423137600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 1.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Regulation of Lobbying Bill 2014: Committee Stage","time":1423137900,"counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500013#R00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1423137900,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500013#R00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423137900,"counter":93,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423137900,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 1 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423137900,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I want to raise a general issue that has arisen in the context of lobbying in the last week.

The Government approved this at the end of last year.  Serendipitously, this morning I launched the new process in the Public Appointments Service and the <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>website was formally launched.  Virtually everyone involved was gathered at the launch.  There were a couple of hundred people at it.  These were people not only from the State agencies but people from recruitment agencies and organisations such as the Public Appointments Service and the top level appointments committee.<br\/><br\/>There was a discussion and I was very clear that we want to have transparency on lobbying.  However, I also want to encourage people to lobby for a position on State boards.  As I said when we discussed it in the other House, this amendment misses the point.  We want the National Women's Council, the Disability Federation of Ireland, community groups and so forth to lobby to have people on State boards and for them to say that they have excellent people within their communities.  This is an area in which we want openness and transparency so long as it goes through the proper process.  This will be through one portal, <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>.  The criteria for appointment will be set out and all applications will be individually vetted and shortlisted for a Minister to make a final decision.  It misses the point of the new arrangement to say that this is something which should be done almost in secret and that people should secretly and not in a proactive, open way seek appointment to State boards.  This will be done in a completely open way.  The National Women's Council and other groups which are under-represented on State boards will be able to lobby formally for their views to be represented.

Will the Minister clarify if that is where it stops?  Is there now a clear line of demarcation?  To use the Minister's example, once the National Women's Council sends in the CVs of one or two people whom it wishes to get on a board to represent a particular viewpoint from a lobbying perspective, if those from the council meet a Minister in their constituency at an event relevant to the business in hand, will they now no longer be allowed to say that they have submitted the names of X and Y?  Further, will the Minister, in a case such as this, no longer be able to respond?  Has there to be complete silence on it?  Where does the buck stop?  I am not clear on this and neither are others.

In the design structure of this legislation, people who are characterised as lobbyists, which is set out in the Bill in the definition of a lobbyist, are required to register when engaged in lobbying.  This is the general architecture of the Bill.  On State board appointments, there is a new State boards appointments system in place since the end of last year.  All appointments to State boards must go through this process.  Candidates must apply through the portal, <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>, for the specific vacancies which will be set out on the website.  The qualifications required for the particular jobs or positions to be advertised will be set out.  Applications will be made and those applications will be individually professionally vetted by the Public Appointments Service, as it does for all appointments in the public service generally.  It will then present a suitable list to the Minister of people it deems to be qualified for the Minister to make the final selection.  This is the process.  Should, for example, the National Women's Council, a disability group or any other group wish to say there are not enough women on any board, they are entitled and should be entitled to do this.  This is the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>.  They meet a Minister and they say to him or her that there is a national obligation to reach the stated target of 40% and this has not happened.  They can tell the Minister to get on with it and ensure there are enough applicants.  They also can, within the community, seek out applicants.  For example, if they want to promote women, they can encourage them to apply through the <i>stateboards.ie <\/i>portal.

That is what I sought to do and that is why we fixed on an organisation with ten employees or more, lest there be any confusion about it.  I wanted to avoid a situation where people would not understand whether they were covered or not.  For example, we did not want to capture the normal interaction in business that a political representative would make because every Deputy and Senator is covered by this legislation.  We had to decide, for example, whether somebody going into a politician's clinic and making a communication would be a registerable issue.  We need to have some level of scale to make it an acceptable capturing of lobbyists.<\/p>  <p>Amendment No. 16 looks at the issue from the point of view of turnover rather than simply the number of employees.  The point was made in the other House that a relatively small company with four or five employees might have a big turnover.  I was concerned that this threshold would place a burden on lobbyists to submit audited accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPOC.  Furthermore, turnover is not a fixed entity so a company could become registerable because of a slight increase in turnover over the course of a year, for example.  Again, it all adds to the complexity and uncertainty about who is captured and who is not.  It also makes it more difficult for the SIPOC to make determinations on companies as it would have to go through the company accounts to see what the turnover was and mistakes are highly likely in those circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>In order to have certainty in this new legislation, which is ground breaking, I wanted to stick to the more clearly understood terms as set out in the Bill.  I have said that I envisage this being reviewed after 12 months or so.  We will see how it works out and if there is a need for an amendment at that stage, I would certainly approach it with an open mind, as I am sure would whoever is sitting in this seat at that point in time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500015#T01200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423138800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423138800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 7, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:&ldquo;(b) communications by or on behalf of an employer, other than a registered person, with not more than 10 employees and less than &euro;10 million of an annual turnover, relating to the affairs of the employer about any matter other than the development or zoning of land under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2014;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500015#T01400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423138800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423138800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500015#T01600","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1423138800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 17:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 7, line 27, after &ldquo;organisation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including international non-governmental organisation&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>I wish to withdraw this amendment now and table it again on Report Stage because there is an error in it as published.

Politics depends on trust and public trust in our political institutions is essential but as we all know, it has come under a lot of pressure in recent times.  There is something profoundly alarming about political cartels exercising undue influence over Government decision making and any situation that involves private gain going before national interests is very alarming.  <br\/><br\/>This Bill has been a long time in the making and is generally welcome.  I would like to commend the Minister on his expertise and his good work in this area.  However, there are some areas where I feel the Government has not given due weight to exempting certain vital communications from the general definition of lobbying.  It is on that basis that I am seeking to amend section 5 of the Bill which deals with excepted communications.  The amendment I am proposing is reasonable and would allow the Bill to reflect that certain types of communication of concern should be protected from disclosure for the reasons I will set out.<br\/><br\/>I am seeking to amend section 5, subsection (5) by inserting a new subsection (5)(p) which would read, &quot;any communication, howsoever made, by a person specified in <i>subsection 2(b) <\/i>and <i>2(c) <\/i>where the purpose of that communication is to disclose relevant wrongdoings&quot;.  <\/p> <p>Furthermore, my amendment invites a consequential amendment to section 5(9), which sets out the definition of terms in section 5.  This amendment is to include a definition of \"relevant wrongdoings\" and is a necessary addition if my amendment to section 5 proposing the insertion of subsection (5)(p) is accepted. <\/p> <p>The amendment to section 5(9) would define \"relevant wrongdoings\" exclusively as follows: the commission of an offence; a miscarriage of justice; non-compliance with a legal obligation; health and safety threats; misuse of public moneys; mismanagement by a public official; damage to the environment; abuses of constitutionally protected rights; or concealment or destruction of information relating to any of the foregoing.  In terms of the rationale for this, section 5 deals with accepted communications - in other words, communications that would not be deemed to be disclosable lobbying communications or activities.  It is prudent to have such a list, in particular, where matters of diplomacy or State security would be otherwise exposed to inclusion as lobbying activity and therefore potentially subject to disclosure.  <\/p> <p>My amendment seeks to protect organisations and individuals representing those organisations who come forward with information concerning wrongdoing from inclusion under the heading of lobbying.  As the section stands, I have a serious concern regarding the protection of sources of information, particularly where an organisation may approach an Oireachtas Member with confidential information about actual or alleged wrongdoing.  I have excluded the persons envisaged in section 5(2)(a), as the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 - the whistleblower legislation - makes provision in a fuller manner for protection for employees making disclosures regarding relevant wrongdoing.  The statutory protection against victimisation in that Act is very welcome.  <\/p> <p>The purpose of this amendment is to exclude certain communications made by persons from organisations that would normally be considered to be engaged in lobbying - for example, unions, representative organisations or non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  As matters stand, persons from these organisations, on behalf of their organisation, may approach Oireachtas Members with information regarding wrongdoing in the public interest without the suggestion of lobbying.  I fear that if this amendment does not carve out a specific exception for such information, organisations such as those listed may be reluctant to come forward with information as, in doing so, they may be identifiable under the relevant provisions of this Bill.<\/p> <p>There is a subtle but importance difference between the understanding of lobbying - that is, to change official discourse or decision-making on a given issue - and disclosure of wrongdoing, which has the aim of serving the public interest by exposing actual or alleged harmful behaviour.  If an organisation or person acting on behalf of that organisation felt the need to protect a source, whether they be an individual or a group of individuals, and that organisation or person reasonably believed that the only guarantee of anonymity was to deny that they had met an Oireachtas Member, if questioned by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, or any other organisation, then their denial would be in breach of the provisions of this Bill.  However, with my amendment, the communication of wrongdoing would be protected from the description of lobbying and protected from the attendant requirement of disclosure that this Bill entails.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, I believe that persons or organisations must have a right to approach legislators in a free society with information about wrongdoing - this is in the public interest - and to be able to do so without having to reveal themselves and thereby potentially reveal their sources of information.  In certain cases, the knowledge that a particular organisation approached a particular person amounts to a destruction of anonymity where something in the public interest is being revealed.  This right to protection from disclosure can be defended by an analogy with similar rights enjoyed by journalists, which are protected in law. <\/p> <p>While I agree that the Government and the Executive should be held to a standard of full disclosure, the same standard applied to Oireachtas Members in the course of their duties will damage the confidentiality that is necessary to expose wrongdoing and highlight potential abuse of public funds.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500015#T02500","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423139400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I genuinely and warmly thank the Senator for both the amendment and his contribution.

That is my understanding of the situation in the Bill.  Having reread closely section 5(9), which defines what relevant matters are and what is a disclosable communication, I would point out that the relevant matters under section 5(9) are matters relating to the initiation, development or modification of any public policy or of any public programme; the preparation or amendment of an enactment; or the award of any grant, loan, financial support, contract or any other agreement, or of any licence or authorisation involving public funds, apart from any other matter relating only to the implementation of any such policy programme, enactment or reward or of a technical nature.  My advice is still that this achieves what I intended, and what Senator Mullen intends as well, but, for the avoidance of any doubt, I have written again to the Attorney General to be clear that this is achieved.  If there is any doubt in the matter, I propose to bring any amending proposal to this House on Report Stage next week.  As of now I am satisfied that all the genuine, good and proper concerns raised by the Senator are fully met, but, for the avoidance of doubt, I have asked that this be confirmed formally by the Attorney General to me, and if there is any doubt, or even a shadow of a doubt, I will bring forward an amendment to the Bill next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500016#U00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423139400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much for his open and thoughtful response to my amendment.  An issue arose during my time in the Oireachtas which might illustrate the concern I have and which may be of assistance to the Minister and his officials.  I think it is probably on point, but I would welcome the opportunity to tease it out with the Minister further, although not necessarily in this immediate forum.  The Minister will come back with his response and we will look at what might happen on Report Stage.  Speaking from memory, a number of years ago the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, brought forward legislation in regard to defence which had to do with the appointment, and the criteria for appointment, of military judges.  I came to have information - other Members, including Senator O'Donovan, were also familiar with the issues involved - that in effect, the legislation was designed to undo a problem that had occurred whereby the person that the Defence Forces leadership proposed to appoint to a particular position could be said, it seemed, not to be technically qualified for the position.  As a result, legislation was brought forward which widened the criteria and, in effect, would have retrospectively enabled the appointment process to open up again and to facilitate, under the new headings and under the new legal requirements, the appointment of the particular person.  It did not come to pass that this particular person was appointed to the job in question.  That probably had to do - excuse my language - with the stink we created about this issue in this House.  There were two issues.  The first was that the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, did not disclose to us - nor were Members of the Oireachtas briefed to this effect - the back-story of that legislation to widen the criteria for appointment of military judges.  The other issue was that a proposed appointment had gone wrong and an issue had been raised internally within the Army about whether that person could be appointed to that post.  My point is this: if I had not been briefed by certain persons that this was the back-story, I would not have been able to do my job as a Member of the Oireachtas and ask hard questions, not only about the content of the legislation but about why it was before us in the first place.  I was subsequently contacted by the military police, as was their right and duty, to assist them with their investigation of a possible leak from the Defence Forces and so on in breach of the law, and obviously, with due regard to my prior duty as a Member of the Oireachtas, I declined to make any statement.  I still have not made, and I will not be making, any statement about where I got the information.  If that information, for example, had come from a representative body, it seems that this kind of disclosure by a representative body would attract attention.<\/p> <p>We should remember that this was a disclosure made to enable me and other Members of the Seanad to challenge legislation, policy and the initiation, development or modification of what was public policy or a public programme, namely, the bringing forward of legislation around making certain State and State-funded appointments.  It was exactly that kind of situation I had in mind when bringing forward this amendment, namely, that people concerned about certain legislation being enacted, which they believed was in furtherance of some agenda which was not being fully disclosed, would not be in a position to approach me if they had to register as lobbyists because they were approaching me in order to get me to oppose certain legislation.  I would be happy to say more to the Minister privately about the circumstances but the memory of that instance caused me to look with particular concern at the Bill as it currently stands.  It is difficult to talk about it in retrospect given the need to protect those who disclosed information to me.  In the light of that personal experience I am concerned about the Bill in its current form.  I look forward to possible engagement with the Minister in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500016#U00300","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423140000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Senator is somewhat luckier than me.  When I received information of that nature I had to fight the case both in the High Court and the Supreme Court to protect the person who disclosed the information to me, as I thought was right and proper in relation to my duties as a Member of the Oireachtas, and the right of any citizen to contact any of us.  It was for that very reason that when I came to my current position I was able to advance a suite of proposals that overlap and interact that will achieve the current objectives of Senator Mullen that I had at one time.  The Protected Disclosures Act is now part of the legal architecture of the country and will protect individual whistleblowers who disclose information from any procedural wrongdoing or maladministration of the type Senator Mullen instanced without putting themselves under hazard.  In addition, the strengthening of freedom of information legislation will allow the probing of any documentation on these matters and to have full disclosure of the procedures that are going on.<\/p>  <p>This Bill will not, for the very reason we talked about in the course of debate on a previous amendment, capture individuals who want to come to individual Members of the Oireachtas with their concerns or other information in terms of what is considered normal advocacy because citizens are entitled to have an opinion on legislation.

When framing the legislation, a number of options were considered in terms of how other countries define lobbying in legislation.  The initial landmark legislation in Canada defined lobbying as attempting to influence public policy.  That was the way other countries were going to go.  However, that was found to be a very confining definition because in point of fact, in law, to prove that one was attempting to influence became an obstacle.  Canada subsequently amended its federal law to change the definition from \"attempting to influence\" to \"any oral or written communication made to a designated official\".  The definition used in the Bill is therefore the broad definition rather than the narrow one.  We need to be more explicit in terms of exemptions to ensure that with such a broad definition, we do not capture all communications that would make the entire procedure inoperable, that all communications between officials and anyone else involved would be subject to the legislation.  It would be bizarre if every time a Senator, for example, met someone in the pub it would be considered lobbying.  That is the reason we set out in section 5(9), which I read to the House, what are deemed to be &ldquo;relevant matters&rdquo;.  It is what we intend lobbying to be, which is matters relating to &ldquo;the initiation, development or modification of any public policy&rdquo;, &ldquo;the preparation or amendment of an enactment&rdquo; or a piece of law, or &ldquo;the award of any grant, loan or other financial support, contract or other agreement, or of any licence or other authorisation involving public funds&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500017#V00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423140000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Even in a pub?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500017#V00700","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1423140000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Yes, even in a pub.

Looking at international best practice, I think that is achieved in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>Last week on Second Stage I said that we have probably taken more feedback on the legislation from stakeholders than on any other legislation because, in a way, although it is probably seen by many as not as important as the Freedom of Information Act or even the other related legislation, in a way it goes to the heart of what politics is about, namely, the interaction of public organisations with policy-makers.  We wish to facilitate a proper democratic interaction.  We wish to do that in a transparent way but we do not want to make it hidebound such that it would be impossible to do public business.  For those reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500017#V00800","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423140000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I seek some information on the matter.

The ones mentioned in amendment No. 27 are senior public servants between the ranks of Secretary General and principal officer, regulators and management boards of public bodies.  I was part of a fisheries delegation to Brussels recently and many people in the fisheries industry, for example, are of the opinion that there are certain key players in the fisheries industry who lobby senior departmental officials on a regular basis and that the policies of certain Departments almost mirror the needs of the bigger players and those who appear to be closer to the people who have influence.  The types of people I am talking about here are people of influence in policy-making.  While Ministers have the final say, if one looks over a number of years and different Ministers in a Department, one often discerns that the trend in a Department tends to continue, even when the Ministers come and go.  Senior public servants certainly have a key role in the development of policy.  I appreciate the Minister has empowered himself to include these categories as designated public officials but Sinn F&eacute;in cannot discern any reason not to include them at the outset for the thousands of doubt in this scenario.  This is why Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled amendment No. 27.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500018#W01000","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1423140600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions and amendments and I understand their concerns.  The idea is that the Government will set out a number of designated public officials that will be captured from the outset.  These include Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State, Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Members of the European Parliament for constituencies in the State, members of local authorities, special advisers appointed under section 11 of the Public Service Management Act and then, in the point on which Senator Norris and others have focused, public servants of a prescribed description.  That deliberately is a catch-all phrase because no matter what list I put down today, people would have suggested there was another category I should have included.<br\/><br\/>For example, if one takes the grade of assistant secretary, there is an entire range of analogous grades of assistant secretary across the public service, some of which are of a technical nature, such as chief medical officers and a variety of other assistant secretary level grades.  However, they do not lend themselves to being listed in one exhaustive item of primary legislation.  That is the sort of thing that normally is done by secondary legislation, that is, by statutory instrument, and that is what I wish to do.<br\/><br\/>In my opening statement, I already have indicated to Members that from the outset, I intend that Secretaries General, assistant secretaries and equivalent grades be captured, as well as analogous grades in the local authorities, including chief executive officers of local authorities.  Within 12 months, I intend to bring in principal officers and then we will have a debate to decide on what other suitable categories should be brought in.  This is designed not to try to be exhaustive from the beginning but to be enabling of a gradual broadening, while capturing from the beginning the key set of policy-formers both, as Senator Norris described, in the transient Government and the permanent government, in so far as possible.  However, other grades may occur to us that would not occur to us as being particularly high-profile but which may be quite influential and which should be subject to designation under the legislation.<br\/><br\/>I did not answer Senator Byrne's question on the communications message, which is very important.  This morning, I launched the <i>StateBoards.ie<\/i>website at which, I do not think he will mind me mentioning it, I had a private discussion with the Ombudsman on the operation of this legislation.  A huge amount of work already is under way with my officials and the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPOC, in the preparation of this measure because part of the job of the SIPOC will be the communication of this legislation to people.  Many changes have been and are being brought about in respect of freedom of information, lobbying and so on that must be communicated to people now and Senator Byrne makes valid points.  We will have a communication strategy and SIPOC will be given responsibility to ensure that people are aware of the new responsibilities once this measure becomes law of the land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500018#W01100","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423140600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Again, while I can understand the Minister's position, I make the point that he himself has listed off people who he thinks clearly should be on it such as Secretaries General, assistant secretaries and so on.  As they already are targets, I am unsure why they should not be included in the Bill.  How will one know who is caught by this measure if it simply is left in the general phraseology currently in the Bill?  Moreover, if the Minister can do this by ministerial regulation, there is nothing to stop him from doing it in the Bill itself.  I am familiar with the argument that frequently is made in terms of describing categories to the effect that there is a problem about being exhaustive and catching everybody.  However, that could be remedied by another provision stating \"such other officers as the Minister shall prescribe from time to time\".  However, I see no reason that Secretaries General and assistant secretaries, who have been mentioned by the Minister as clear targets, should not be listed in the legislation.<\/p> <p>It is not an overwhelming point, because apparently these people are going to be dealt with at some stage - some of them now and some of them in a year's time.  If the Minister can list them off - he has listed them off to the House already - I do not see why they cannot be listed in the Bill.  Otherwise, one could say \"prescribed political representatives\" rather then Ministers, Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, Members of the European Parliament, local authorities and so on.

Public officials do not spend all of their working lives abroad.  If they do go abroad, it is only a small part of their job.

It would mean that every time I went to Brussels or elsewhere on Government business, if anybody wanted to come up to me for a chat, I would have to ask them whether they were registered under the Irish legislation on lobbying and whether they fell within its parameters, and I would have to take their details before I talked to them to make sure they were registered.  That would be so impractical in view of the normal activity of European Council, where the people who attend meet officials and so on.  It would fall to every Member of this House to do so as well.  It would not only apply to those attending an informal meeting of the European Council or anything else; if Members or officials were abroad on holiday and somebody talked to them or engaged them in conversation, they would have to have that type of discussion.

I am not impugning the reputation of any company but Guinness, owned by Diageo, comes to mind.  If it wanted to keep its feet clean in Ireland, its representatives could always lobby Irish officials abroad.  All this requires is registration of the fact that there has been lobbying, and that is not very detailed and it would not take very long.  It is not an onerous requirement and it would have nothing to do with conversations on holiday.  This would relate to official business when, for example, a multinational corporation would try to lobby an Irish official in the interests of the company's operations in Ireland.  It is a reasonable proposal that does not alter the thrust of the Bill at all.  It would not change the Bill but it would add an element in circumstances where it is impossible to force the company in Britain, America or Europe to register as lobbyists.

I have tabled it to ensure we are all absolutely clear about the intentions of this Bill.  I was surprised to read an article in today's <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in which one of my colleagues suggested that this Bill could promote a culture of secrecy.  I think the exact opposite.  I suggest it was unhelpful, to say the least.  A former US Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis, once said that sunlight is the best disinfectant.  I think that is what this lobbying Bill is about.  I want to ensure businesses, civil society, non-governmental organisations and others have equality of access to our politicians and officials.  It is something on which I pride myself, as a Member of the Legislature here in Ireland.  I remember being involved in youth work at European level as a young person in my 20s.  I looked at the excellent access we have in Ireland to our public officials, our Legislature and our politicians.  We want to ensure it is done transparently and openly and not in such a way that anything is done behind the scenes.  My understanding is that the intention of this Bill is to ensure we change that culture.  Only so much can be done by legislation.  As Senators and Deputies, we have a role in supporting the cultural shift that is also needed.<br\/><br\/>I have tabled this amendment because there is a concern that appearing on the register of lobbyists will have a negative impact in terms of perception.  I do not want to speak for the Minister, but I know we are trying to ensure lobbying is not a bad word.  I believe we engage in lobbying because we care, we want to see change and we want to advocate for change.  If people are engaged, that is something positive.  I often think that if people say nothing, perhaps they do not care.  We want to ensure people can lobby.  I do not want organisations that are on the register of lobbyists to be disqualified in some way from consideration for grants.  If this legislation discourages people from getting involved, it will be counterproductive.  I would like the Minister to give the House a clear statement on the intention of the Bill in respect of the amendment I have tabled.  If we are in agreement, I hope the Minister, who spoke earlier about the communications strategy, can clearly instruct his ministerial colleagues and the public bodies that grants and lobbying are not to be linked.  I do not think they should be linked.  One should not be prohibited from getting a grant just because one is on a lobbying register.  Both activities should be done in full transparency and openness.  I am not asking for any secrecy.  We should not say that one excludes the other.  That is my intention in proposing this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500021#Z00800","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1423142400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>While I understand Senator van Turnhout's concerns, it seems to me that nothing in the Bill actually suggests that a person who is registered as a lobbyist would be prevented from getting a grant.

I understand where Senator van Turnhout is coming from, but I do not think her concerns are reflected in the text of the Bill.  I welcome the opportunity to mention on the record that there are some very good and very valuable lobbyists.  I am concerned about the multinationals, the big cigarette corporations and the drinks industry.  These sorts of people have a disproportionate influence.  It is very often under the radar.  We want to expose that.  Of course those who lobby for sports or recreational facilities for inner-city children should get their grants.  I have no problem with their lobbying to get grants.  That is what it is all about.  That is part of the political process.  It is useful that Senator van Turnhout has proposed this amendment to have this matter ventilated.

The Bill is not intended to discourage communication of these issues and will have no impact - negatively, positively, or any other way - on that.  I have provided for clarity the formal advice I have received from the Attorney General on the impact of this provision.  There are of course already rules in place in relation to certain matters where lobbying is inappropriate and might lead to disqualification.  I refer, for example, to jobs advertised on <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>.  That is <i>sui generis<\/i>.  People will understand that.

The review of the Act will also provide an opportunity to assess further, in the light of experience, whether this legislation is applying as we fully intend it to.  The intention of the Bill is not to change the type of current behaviour as instanced by Senators Norris and van Turnhout.  Proper lobbying is a vital component of our democratic process.  It is not my intention to put that in jeopardy.  I probably spoke flippantly last week when I said I am in favour of normal lobbying for the public good, as opposed to the vested interest type lobbying which is not for the public good.  As I said last week, I want to put the sort of lobbying that used to take place in the Galway tent under the microscope.  The normal good work of charitable organisations that are involved in advocacy for homelessness, the disability sector or any other area of activity is absolutely to be protected.

On this one, they have missed the point completely because most NGOs would not be in a position to give large fees to a lobbyist to lobby on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>What we are looking at here is the scenario of the Galway tent that the Minister outlined previously, where if a lobbyist is paid to go around with bags of cash to lobby people, even if he or she does it within the parameters, we should know how much people are being lobbied, for example, how much the multinationals or big companies are paying the lobbyists to do the type of work that they are doing compared with an NGO which might be lobbying on the other side of an argument.  For example, in the case of the tobacco sector, which was used by Senator Norris earlier, the tobacco companies could potentially spend hundreds of thousands of euro to hire a lobbyist to do a lot of work on their behalf whereas the NGOs lobbying on the other side of that argument would not have such sums available to them.  In the era of transparency, that is exactly why one needs an amendment like this.  It is so one can see when that type of activity is happening.<\/p>  <p>It is not about breaking down the costs of every NGO when they come to speak to a Minister.  It is about the lobbyist who is paid, either on a contract or fee, to do this type of lobbying.  That is essential if we are to have any real belief in the Bill.

One of the most difficult things is to narrow or circumscribe people's right to work, which is what this provision does.  I have said we will apply this to the following categories: Ministers of the Government; Ministers of State;  and special advisers and public servants of a prescribed description which are Secretaries General, assistant secretaries general, the chief executive officers of local authorities and the director of services of local authorities.  These categories will expand over time as I have indicated.  I do not think they should apply to every Deputy and Senator.

Bluntly, the advice I have is that if one is to state people cannot work for two years one will have to compensate them for it, and I do not want to get into the business of making extended payments to people who leave the public service in compensation for disallowing them to take up roles in certain categories of work.  It is about striking a balance to create sufficient clear water.  A year is sufficient clear water after someone leaves public service, because what I want to stop is the notion of people being responsible for one activity in the public service at the end of January and in February walking into the very area which they regulated, which happened in the past.  A one-year gap clears the air in an appropriate way and is a very good start if these issues are to be addressed in the future.  This is the first time this is being done and it is a robust and sound measure that is proportionate and constitutional, which is an important consideration also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015020500023#BB00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1423143600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I largely agree with the Minister, but I do not see the difference between preventing people from being a lobbyist for one year or two years.
