Since then, it has evolved into a complex organisation with multiple functions and roles.  We have tried to provide an overview of those many roles and functions in Chapter 28.<\/p><p>  The sets of financial statements produced by the agency reflect the complex structure that exists and the funds it manages.  The various financial statements are explained in paragraphs 28.5 to 28.7.  The committee may wish to note that, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, five small accounts which were accounted for separately in prior years have been incorporated into the 2012 national debt accounts, for efficiency reasons.  The level of information presented is not affected.  Legislation is planned to revise the structure and governance of the agency and its constituent bodies.  Those proposals will, in due course, require further restructuring of the financial statements and accounts.<\/p><p>  The NTMA&rsquo;s primary function remains the management of borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the agency&rsquo;s national debt account, which is also reproduced by the Department of Finance as part of the annual finance accounts.  General Government debt is the standard measure used to report Government debt under Maastricht treaty provisions.  At the end of 2012, general Government debt stood at around &euro;192 billion, an increase of &euro;23 billion or 14% year on year.  The end of 2012 debt represented 117% of gross domestic product, compared with 104% a year earlier.<\/p><p>  The principal components of general Government debt at the end of 2012 were borrowing by the agency on behalf of the State, referred to as gross national debt and which is accounted for in the national debt account, and promissory notes issued in 2010 by the Minister for Finance to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the EBS, which were not included in the agency&rsquo;s national debt accounting.  The nominal value of the promissory notes at the end of 2012 was just over &euro;25 billion.  As part of the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in February 2013, the related promissory notes were cancelled.  These were replaced with floating rate Government bonds issued by the agency, which now form part of the gross national debt.  The nominal value of the outstanding EBS promissory notes was &euro;214 million at the end of June 2013.  At that date, almost 90% of the gross national debt was in the form of medium to long-term debt.  Figure 2.6 presents a maturity profile of the debt and indicates that more than &euro;100 billion falls due for repayment by 2020.  Funding received under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland accounted for almost one third of gross national debt.<\/p><p>  Between September 2010 and July 2012, the NTMA did not actively seek funding in the bond markets because the cost of borrowing would have been too high.  Since mid-2011, there has been a sharp fall in the cost of Government borrowing, as indicated in figure 2.4.  This allowed the agency to re-enter the market.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on the current position in that regard.  Part of the NTMA&rsquo;s funding strategy since the beginning of the financial crisis has been the maintenance of high levels of Exchequer cash balances.  At the end of June 2013, the total of cash balances and other financial assets stood at more than &euro;30 billion.<\/p><p>  The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in April 2001 with a statutory objective to meet as much as possible of the costs of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 until at least 2055.  The fund is controlled by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.  The Minister for Finance decided in 2009 to use part of the assets of the fund to assist in dealing with the financial crisis.  As provided for in law, he directed the commission to make substantial investments in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The financial statements of the fund for the year ended 31 December 2012 indicate that at that date the fund had assets of &euro;14.6 billion.  This comprised directed investments valued at &euro;8.6 billion and the residual discretionary portfolio valued at just over &euro;6 billion.  As set out in note 16 of the fund accounts, the planned NTMA legislation will result in changes to the fund, including establishment of the Ireland strategic investment fund and the dissolution of the commission.<\/p><p>  In my 2011 report on the accounts of the public services, I reported on excess non-contractual charges levied on the fund by State Street Bank Europe Limited, which provided transition management services for the sale of &euro;4.7 billion of fund assets in early 2011.  Following the discovery of the overcharging, the fund received reimbursements totalling &euro;3.2 million and the matter was investigated by the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority.  As the committee is probably aware, the authority published its final notice in relation to the investigation on 30 January 2014.  The authority imposed a fine on State Street Bank Europe of almost &pound;23 million sterling for breaches of the authority&rsquo;s principles for financial service businesses.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in this regard.<\/p><p>  Another key function of the National Treasury Management Agency is the management of compensation claims against certain State bodies in personal injury, property damage and clinical negligence claims.  When performing these functions, the agency is known as the State Claims Agency.  Chapter 29 examines the agency&rsquo;s management of the clinical indemnity scheme, which accounts for the highest value claims.  The scheme was established in 2002.  It covers all medical malpractice and clinical negligence claims arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients taken against public health care enterprises and their clinical, nursing and allied health care practitioners.  The scheme is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis from a subhead in the Health Service Executive Vote.  In 2012, the total payout by the agency in respect of settled claims was in excess of &euro;60 million.  An amount of &euro;45 million was received by the Exchequer in December 2012 from a UK-based medical defence organisation, the Medical Defence Union.  The amount represented a negotiated settlement reached in respect of the union&rsquo;s remaining liabilities in Ireland dating from before 1 February 2004, when clinical indemnity scheme cover was extended to the union&rsquo;s members.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2012, the agency had about 2,600 clinical claims on hand with a potential liability estimated at &euro;970 million.  The estimate is based on the most likely outcome in respect of the amount of awards or settlements and all associated costs, plus a margin of comfort of up to 20%.  The estimate is used to prepare annual budget forecasts and is disclosed in the annual financial statements of the agency and the HSE.  The agency views the 20% comfort margin as an acknowledged, conventional provision used by prudential insurers and indemnity providers.  However, as the scheme is a State-funded pay-as-you-go scheme, the examination concluded that the inclusion of the 20% margin may result in overstatement of the potential liability in respect of active claims.  We recommended that the estimates of potential liability for cases on hand should be based on statistical probabilities and informed by analysis of the outcomes of previous cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Business of Committee","time":1392249600,"counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300003#B00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1392249600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Are the minutes of the private meeting of 30 January and the meeting of 6 February agreed?

The discussion we had was based on the procedural advice the committee received that we were not in a position to release the transcript because it would mark a fundamental change in procedure which would affect other committees in future.  From this point of view, the advice was to refer it to the CPP.  Another issue raised was that the Oireachtas would not be in a position to provide a redacted transcript of the evidence.  On this basis the committee decided, with Deputy Ross dissenting, that it would not send a transcript or accede to Sergeant McCabe's request.

I was astonished at the decision taken by the committee.  To go back to first principles, before we come to the CPP or any other body, the reason the evidence from Sergeant McCabe was taken in private session was as a precaution to ensure neither the committee nor the sergeant, wittingly or otherwise, stepped outside our remit and made statements which would get the sergeant or somebody else into legal hot water.  This is why we held the session in private.  We did not hold a session in private because the people gathered around the committee room took a vow of secrecy.  We did not hold a session in private in a bid to withhold legitimate information from the public domain.  We held the session in private solely and specifically as a legal precaution.  We need to remember this.<\/p><p>  In light of this I believe we made it clear to Sergeant McCabe, at the end of the meeting when we discussed matters, that should he make an application to the committee for a transcript of his evidence, we would facilitate it.<\/p> <p>For the life of me, I cannot understand why the committee would take the position to hold his testimony private.  To guard it in that way seems outrageous and unnecessary.  In the course of this debacle, for all sorts of reasons damage has been done, certainly in the mind of the public, to the idea of whistleblowers, whistleblowing within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, how that is regarded and so on.  We do more damage by needlessly insisting on not giving this man a transcript of his evidence, as requested by his solicitor.  Members know I would have preferred to hear him in public session.  I understand why that did not happen, but it is not credible for us to take the position that the man should not get a transcript of his own evidence or that we as a committee would not consider making that transcript public.  That is what we should do and I see no reason not to.  Therefore, the letter went to the clerk to the committee.<\/p><p> It is concerning that the committee took this decision last week.  If, as the clerk advises, we must go through another Oireachtas structure to release that document, so be it.  I would like a fuller explanation.  I do not understand why that other structure could not give a copy of the transcript to Sergeant McCabe.  Bear in mind, we ordinarily hear testimony from Accounting Officers and all sorts of other individuals in this committee room in public session.  That is our normal practice.  We heard Sergeant McCabe in private session simply to guard against any legal mishap.  I do not believe that happened in the course of the meeting and I see no good reason to deny the sergeant a copy of the transcript of his evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300003#B01100","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392250200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Deputy Dowds is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300004#C00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1392250200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will waive my write to speak for the moment and contribute later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300004#C00300","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1392250200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We receive a significant amount of correspondence every week, deal with it at a meeting and make a decision on what to do with it.

We made a decision and had an extensive discussion on it.<\/p><p>  This is where I disagree with Deputy McDonald.  We did not decide to hold the meeting in private session for legal fears, although many of us had those fears.  The actual reason that we decided to hold the meeting in private session - I am sure the clerk can confirm this, as it is on the record of this committee - was that we received a written request from Sergeant McCabe to receive his evidence in private session.  We never got to the stage where we had a debate or division on whether we should have the meeting in public or private.<\/p><p>  Sergeant McCabe was at the meeting.  He is privy to what was discussed at it.  I made the point last week that if Sergeant McCabe's legal advisers wanted access for some reason to an audio tape or to hear what was said for his legal protection, it would be quite different from producing a transcript.  However, we were told quite clearly last week that we did not have the power and had to go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP.  We were also told by our legal advisers at the private session meeting, which has now been extensively discussed, that there were things said at that meeting that, if a transcript was produced, would have to be redacted.  We have now been told very clearly by the clerk from the advice he sought that there is no such thing as a redacted transcript, that it cannot be redacted.  That was what we were clearly told last week.  I can recall things that were said at the private meeting - it was held in private for a reason - that, if they were to be published, could pose legal difficulties for the whistleblower.  That is the clear legal advice we were given.

Examples of that would be security and privacy reasons.

The information provided at that meeting will feed into the report which the committee will produce.  That is the work of this committee.  Ultimately, our job is to prepare a report based on all the evidence put before us, including the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, evidence from the Garda Commissioner and his colleagues and the evidence of Sergeant McCabe during the private meeting.  Taking all factors into account and the overall legal ramifications involved, the committee made its decision last week.  One can complicate this all one likes, but fundamentally the meeting was held in private at the witness's request and we cannot release a redacted transcript of his evidence because the Editor of Debates cannot do so.

However, it must be recalled that was on foot of the committee asking him to take legal advice.  It should be borne in mind that a legal adviser was present for the duration of the meeting.  It is nonsense to suggest that somehow we could go to the final frontier in terms of our line of questioning.  I believe we were, as a committee, very tightly monitored and disciplined in terms of our having to remain within very strict parameters when questioning the witness.  That does not tally with the facts.<\/p><p>  I reiterate the meeting was held in private because of legitimate legal concerns.  That is the only reason the meeting was held in private.  It was not because Sergeant McCabe was any less entitled to a public hearing before this committee.  There were legal concerns on his part and on the part of the committee.  That is how we went about our business.  We are now at the far end of that process and the sergeant has, through his solicitor, requested a transcript not of the evidence of another witness but of his evidence.  Sergeant McCabe was the only witness before the committee during that meeting.  He has requested a transcript of that meeting but for some procedural reason or some archaic notion within this system, he cannot have a transcript as requested through his solicitor.  We are telling him he cannot have a transcript of his evidence despite that every other witness on this issue gave evidence in public session, all of whom were free to put whatever they liked on the public record.  It is absolutely and utterly absurd.  In a spirit of frankness with fellow committee members, I interpret that as a political decision.  I do not see it as consistent with our standard practice nor do I see it as in any way legally defensible, current Oireachtas practice notwithstanding.  There are many established practices which, quite frankly, we could well set aside.<\/p><p>  I know we are dealing with this as a matter of correspondence from myself and Deputy Ross.  I would like this decision revisited today.  It remains my position that the transcript ought to be made available to the sergeant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300005#D01000","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1392250800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>We are here as the Committee of Public Accounts representing the public.  Up to now, we have been doing a good job on behalf of the public we represent.  The public is supportive of what has come out of various committees during recent weeks.  I believe that if we now pull down the shutters in terms of particular information we have received and tell the public this is because on occasion this is a private rather than public committee, that would be damaging to the committee.  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  It would tarnish the standing of this committee if we were to go down the road of saying some of our business must be done in private.<\/p><p>  In regard to the point that the release of transcripts of private meetings or sessions would be damaging to that process, I do not believe there is ever a reason for private sessions or meetings.  There is no private session in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Committees of the Houses are supposed to be the equivalent of the D&aacute;il meeting outside of the main Chamber.  I see no reason for private sessions or meetings.  That may be a little revolutionary to some people but it has been my consistent view since entering politics that the D&aacute;il is a public venue and we are elected to act in public.  I believe that is how we should proceed.<\/p> <p>In regard to the record of the evidence, my understanding of the record of the D&aacute;il is that it is not an absolute verbatim transcription of each individual word that has been said.  The essence of the published transcript is to reflect the essence of what is said.  I advise people to check that out.  Many a person stumbles over a word, gets the meaning wrong or inadvertently says the wrong thing, and that is the reason that the blacks are published.  It gives everybody an opportunity - and I do not think too many people avail of the opportunity - to check precisely what they said and whether that is precisely what they meant to say.<\/p><p> The record can reflect the essence of what was said.  I would not be worried if some particular words were not exactly what was intended, once an opportunity is given to the person who said those words to ensure, before the transcript is finalised and a draft transcript issued - not redacted; I do not seek a redacted version - that they are reported correctly, and they should be given an opportunity to have the draft transcript, subject to verification by the people who spoke here.  That includes everybody who spoke here.  Everybody who spoke at the meeting is entitled to have a copy of the transcript, in my opinion, as well as the witness here.  <\/p><p> I understand that many people here are concerned about the witness.  We seem to be very concerned about protecting his legal rights.  He is a big boy.  He has legal advisers.  He is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so he should be well able to look after his own legal rights.  I appreciate that people expressed our concern for him, but it was a little bit feigned.  The Chairman reads out something at the beginning of every meeting to every witness who comes in here, including that gentleman on that day.  It says that the witness has \"absolute privilege.\"  Am I correct, Chairman?  I think he reads out that proviso.  The laws that we passed here in the Oireachtas have given absolute privilege to everything that is said in a committee.  The Chairman continues in his opening remarks - and he might clarify the matter before we conclude this discussion - by stating that if a person is straying into particular ground, he or she can be directed by him, as Chairman, on behalf of the committee to desist, and if he or she does not desist then he or she will lose absolute privilege and may only have partial privilege.  Everything that was said has absolute privilege.  It is my understanding, based on the law of the land that we have passed here, that what is said here has absolute privilege and that Sergeant McCabe would have nothing to worry about legally even if everything he said was published and somebody had an issue with it.  It would be damaging to the Committee of Public Accounts - I emphasise the words \"Public Accounts\" - if we were not to give each person who was at the meeting, including the members, an opportunity to review what was said and to confirm a final transcript.  That should be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300005#D01100","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392251400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Ross, who will be followed by Deputy Deasy, and then we will conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300006#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1392251400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I agree with what Deputy Fleming has said.

I would say to Deputy Fleming that in my opinion, this is the Legislature and that is where we are.  On occasion, legislation is formulated, in my opinion, after private evidence is given in committee.  We would be constructing an impediment to any potential whistleblower wishing to give such testimony to a D&aacute;il committee in a private setting.  We would potentially be compromising any whistleblower or individual who appeared or wanted to appear before a D&aacute;il committee in private.  I am not prepared to jeopardise individuals who might prospectively be giving, or want to give, private evidence to a D&aacute;il committee in the future.  That, effectively, would be the impact of allowing this transcript to be made public.  That is the advice that we have been given - the very strong advice - that it would amount to a fundamental change in how the Oireachtas and its committees do their business.  It provides protection for whistleblowers and I am not prepared to jeopardise that position.

I think it was Deputy Eoghan Murphy who suggested that he should get legal advice.<\/p><p>  Following that, this letter came in.  I take Deputy Eoghan Murphy's point that the solicitor was simply expressing the view, if one likes, of Sergeant McCabe that he would like to have the transcript or that he would seek a transcript.  I asked the clerk to the committee to listen back to the tape of that meeting and it was said that a request would be considered.  It did not say that we would release it, Deputy Ross; it said that it would be considered.  Last week, in my absence, the meeting decided, considered and reached a decision in relation to that.<\/p><p>  There are one or two issues.  The first issue is the letter we received from the solicitor representing Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  It has to be checked if that letter is asking for the transcript as a legal right of a witness, whether it was in private session or not.  Second, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been quoted.  This matter was dealt with but I propose that we seek clarification from the CPP.  I want to know what it is about, how it impacts on the committee and how it distinguishes between that private session and something else.  It is really just on a point of information, because we have been discussing it here and one can get the facts, but the decision, as far as I can make out from the minutes, was made last week.  If that decision, having been made, is going to be challenged either legally or otherwise, then we need to look at that and get advice on it.  I want to ask the clerk to the committee to get the information from the CPP in relation to its belief about how it might impact on committees.  <\/p><p>  Coming to Deputy Ross's proposition, following what I have just described, the clerk to the committee can advise us on the proposition.  At the moment we have the letter from Deputies Ross and McDonald.  By and large, the letter was dealt with in the debate this morning - it was dealt with by the decision of last week - and the only thing that would change any of that would be the CPP's or Mr. McCabe's legal advice and further correspondence from them as to his right, as a witness, to receive the transcript.  As further suggestions have been made by Deputy Sean Fleming that the transcript be made available to all, we need to question that before it is pushed by way of a decision by members.  Deputy Fleming might agree to clarify what he asking us to ask the CPP and Deputies Ross and McDonald might do likewise, while we receive clarification.  As of now, there is no requirement for a division in the committee because there is nothing before us except the letter of request.

Ms Tallon was questioned on this at a meeting here and there are issues in regard to that money.  I would like it to be explained to the committee members, so that we are fully briefed on the matter.  I would also like the audit arrangements in that regard to be outlined.

Since then, it has evolved into a complex organisation with multiple functions and roles.  We have tried to provide an overview of those many roles and functions in Chapter 28.<\/p><p>  The sets of financial statements produced by the agency reflect the complex structure that exists and the funds it manages.  The various financial statements are explained in paragraphs 28.5 to 28.7.  The committee may wish to note that, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, five small accounts which were accounted for separately in prior years have been incorporated into the 2012 national debt accounts, for efficiency reasons.  The level of information presented is not affected.  Legislation is planned to revise the structure and governance of the agency and its constituent bodies.  Those proposals will, in due course, require further restructuring of the financial statements and accounts.<\/p><p>  The NTMA&rsquo;s primary function remains the management of borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the agency&rsquo;s national debt account, which is also reproduced by the Department of Finance as part of the annual finance accounts.  General Government debt is the standard measure used to report Government debt under Maastricht treaty provisions.  At the end of 2012, general Government debt stood at around &euro;192 billion, an increase of &euro;23 billion or 14% year on year.  The end of 2012 debt represented 117% of gross domestic product, compared with 104% a year earlier.<\/p><p>  The principal components of general Government debt at the end of 2012 were borrowing by the agency on behalf of the State, referred to as gross national debt and which is accounted for in the national debt account, and promissory notes issued in 2010 by the Minister for Finance to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the EBS, which were not included in the agency&rsquo;s national debt accounting.  The nominal value of the promissory notes at the end of 2012 was just over &euro;25 billion.  As part of the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in February 2013, the related promissory notes were cancelled.  These were replaced with floating rate Government bonds issued by the agency, which now form part of the gross national debt.  The nominal value of the outstanding EBS promissory notes was &euro;214 million at the end of June 2013.  At that date, almost 90% of the gross national debt was in the form of medium to long-term debt.  Figure 2.6 presents a maturity profile of the debt and indicates that more than &euro;100 billion falls due for repayment by 2020.  Funding received under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland accounted for almost one third of gross national debt.<\/p><p>  Between September 2010 and July 2012, the NTMA did not actively seek funding in the bond markets because the cost of borrowing would have been too high.  Since mid-2011, there has been a sharp fall in the cost of Government borrowing, as indicated in figure 2.4.  This allowed the agency to re-enter the market.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on the current position in that regard.  Part of the NTMA&rsquo;s funding strategy since the beginning of the financial crisis has been the maintenance of high levels of Exchequer cash balances.  At the end of June 2013, the total of cash balances and other financial assets stood at more than &euro;30 billion.<\/p><p>  The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in April 2001 with a statutory objective to meet as much as possible of the costs of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 until at least 2055.  The fund is controlled by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.  The Minister for Finance decided in 2009 to use part of the assets of the fund to assist in dealing with the financial crisis.  As provided for in law, he directed the commission to make substantial investments in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The financial statements of the fund for the year ended 31 December 2012 indicate that at that date the fund had assets of &euro;14.6 billion.  This comprised directed investments valued at &euro;8.6 billion and the residual discretionary portfolio valued at just over &euro;6 billion.  As set out in note 16 of the fund accounts, the planned NTMA legislation will result in changes to the fund, including establishment of the Ireland strategic investment fund and the dissolution of the commission.<\/p><p>  In my 2011 report on the accounts of the public services, I reported on excess non-contractual charges levied on the fund by State Street Bank Europe Limited, which provided transition management services for the sale of &euro;4.7 billion of fund assets in early 2011.  Following the discovery of the overcharging, the fund received reimbursements totalling &euro;3.2 million and the matter was investigated by the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority.  As the committee is probably aware, the authority published its final notice in relation to the investigation on 30 January 2014.  The authority imposed a fine on State Street Bank Europe of almost &pound;23 million sterling for breaches of the authority&rsquo;s principles for financial service businesses.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in this regard.<\/p><p>  Another key function of the National Treasury Management Agency is the management of compensation claims against certain State bodies in personal injury, property damage and clinical negligence claims.  When performing these functions, the agency is known as the State Claims Agency.  Chapter 29 examines the agency&rsquo;s management of the clinical indemnity scheme, which accounts for the highest value claims.  The scheme was established in 2002.  It covers all medical malpractice and clinical negligence claims arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients taken against public health care enterprises and their clinical, nursing and allied health care practitioners.  The scheme is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis from a subhead in the Health Service Executive Vote.  In 2012, the total payout by the agency in respect of settled claims was in excess of &euro;60 million.  An amount of &euro;45 million was received by the Exchequer in December 2012 from a UK-based medical defence organisation, the Medical Defence Union.  The amount represented a negotiated settlement reached in respect of the union&rsquo;s remaining liabilities in Ireland dating from before 1 February 2004, when clinical indemnity scheme cover was extended to the union&rsquo;s members.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2012, the agency had about 2,600 clinical claims on hand with a potential liability estimated at &euro;970 million.  The estimate is based on the most likely outcome in respect of the amount of awards or settlements and all associated costs, plus a margin of comfort of up to 20%.  The estimate is used to prepare annual budget forecasts and is disclosed in the annual financial statements of the agency and the HSE.  The agency views the 20% comfort margin as an acknowledged, conventional provision used by prudential insurers and indemnity providers.  However, as the scheme is a State-funded pay-as-you-go scheme, the examination concluded that the inclusion of the 20% margin may result in overstatement of the potential liability in respect of active claims.  We recommended that the estimates of potential liability for cases on hand should be based on statistical probabilities and informed by analysis of the outcomes of previous cases.<\/p> <p>The agency&rsquo;s claims case load increased by 45% between 2008 and 2012 and the average time taken to resolve cases is also rising.  Direct costs increased to an average of &euro;190,000 per case, which is nearly double the 2009 equivalent figure.  The number of cases resolved remained steady at between 400 and 450 per year, with the majority of claims settled through negotiation.  The total cost of settled claims increased from &euro;20 million in 2008 to &euro;60 million in 2012.<\/p><p> The objective of risk management in regard to the scheme is to minimise the occurrence of adverse clinical events that could result in medical negligence claims.  Health entities covered by the scheme are statutorily obliged to report all adverse clinical events to the agency, but less than 40% of claims received since 2008 had been previously reported to the agency as adverse clinical events.  There is a danger that such under-reporting could undermine achievement of the agency&rsquo;s risk management objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392254400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. McCarthy.

We have given the Committee of Public Accounts a comprehensive briefing note on recent developments in our funding and debt management activities, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NewERA and the State Claims Agency so I propose in my opening statement to refer briefly to each of these areas.<\/p><p>  When I was before the committee in November 2012, the backdrop was quite different.  Ireland was still in the EU-IMF programme but the NTMA had secured a toehold in the international debt markets following the resumption of monthly auctions of short-term treasury bills in the summer of that year.  We had also begun to chip away at the funding cliff presented by a &euro;12 billion bond then due for redemption in January 2014 by offering holders of that bond switching terms into other longer dated bonds and through limited new issuance.  These were positive developments, to be sure, but a far remove from market access.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the NTMA raised &euro;7.5 billion from two medium and long-term syndications and eliminated the January 2014 funding cliff, which was seen by investors as a major obstacle to Ireland's smooth exit from the EU-IMF programme.  At the end of 2013 we maintained Exchequer cash and deposits of &euro;18.5 billion, leaving the Exchequer fully funded into the first quarter of 2015 and providing investors with the necessary funding visibility to enable us successfully exit the EU-IMF programme.  In January 2014, Ireland was the first European country to tap the syndicated bond market in 2014, completing a &euro;3.75 billion ten year issue at a yield of 3.54%.  Crucially, while we had already demonstrated our ability to access the markets, this was the NTMA's first capital market transaction since the exit from the EU-IMF programme.<\/p><p>  The NTMA has conducted a proactive investor relations programme since 2011 with face-to-face meetings in most cases twice a year, in the main investment centres in Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East as well as holding regular meetings with Irish investors.  As a result of the this the NTMA was able to bring the new ten year bond to the market at very short notice in the first week of January 2014.  Having just exited the EU-IMF programme it was important for Ireland to display that it had full market access and being first into the markets before other sovereign borrowers had announced their issuance plans gave us an early mover advantage.  The NTMA will continue its investor relations programme in 2014 as we complete the process of market normalisation.<\/p><p>  In practice, market normalisation means moving away from the so-called opportunistic transactions that characterised our engagement with the markets last year to a scheduled and regular series of bond auctions.  The NTMA's working plan for 2014 is to raise, subject to market conditions, a total of around &euro;8 billion.  Although the order book for the ten year bond sale in January amounted to &euro;14 billion, we decided to limit the size of the new bond to &euro;3.75 billion in order to leave capacity for bond auctions later in the year.  In that context we announced yesterday that the NTMA plans to raise about &euro;4 billion through a series of bond auctions during the course of 2014 with indicative sizes ranging from &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion.  It is planned to hold one or two auctions per quarter with the first auction scheduled to take place on Thursday, 13 March 2014.<\/p><p>  Aside from the bond markets, a particular priority for the NTMA in 2014 is to complete, subject to the necessary legislative change, the conversion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund into the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund which will invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  Work on the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF business plan is at an advanced stage.  Already, in anticipation of the transformation of the National Pensions Reserve Fund into the ISIF we have been working hard to develop a pipeline of potential investments.  A number of these have been concluded and as a result the National Pensions Reserve Fund now has &euro;1.3 billion invested or committed to areas of strategic importance to the economy, including infrastructure, venture capital and long-term financing for small and medium-sized enterprises.  The most recent of these initiatives is a $100 million joint venture with China Investment Corporation, China's main sovereign investment fund, which will invest in Irish technology companies that have a substantial presence or strategic interest in China, and in Chinese technology companies that have a similar interest in Ireland.<\/p><p>  While the ISIF's exclusive Ireland investment mandate represents a significant change of direction from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the new Ireland Strategic Investment Fund will share one important feature with its predecessor: its investments will be undertaken on a commercial basis.  One of the key advantages of the ISIF will be its ability to attract co-investment from domestic and international third parties, such as the China Investment Corporation, who will only put their money to work alongside ours, if they have confidence in the commerciality of the investment process.  I should add that while all investment will have to meet the commerciality test, not every investment will have the same expected return, risk profile or timeframe.<\/p><p>  Before leaving the subject of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, I will return to the matter of overcharging by State Street Bank Europe which we discussed in some detail when I was last before the committee.  While State Street Bank Europe had by then already repaid the overcharge amount of &euro;3.2 million and was no longer providing transition management services to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, I advised the committee that the NTMA had unfinished business in terms of the overall relationship with the State Street group of companies and we were awaiting the outcome of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority investigation before deciding our next steps.<\/p><p>  On Friday, 31 January 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority announced its decision to fine State Street UK &pound;22.9 million for failings in its transition management business as a result of which the National Pensions Reserve Fund and five other clients were deliberately overcharged a total of $20.2 million.  In view of the nature of the failings at State Street identified by the Financial Conduct Authority the National Pensions Reserve Fund terminated its contract with State Street global advisers which managed an indexed equity mandate for the National Pensions Reserve Fund.<\/p><p>  In September 2011 the Government announced the establishment of NewERA, initially on a non-statutory basis, within the NTMA.  The core role of NewERA involves the oversight of the financial performance, corporate strategy, capital and investment plans of the commercial State entities within its remit and working with stakeholders to develop and structure proposals for investment in energy, broadband, water and forestry to support economic activity.  NewERA's role also involves, where requested, advising on corporate finance type issues such as the disposal or restructuring of State assets.<\/p><p>  I should stress that NewERA's role and function is advisory in nature, the respective boards remain responsible for the business and activities of the companies that fall within NewERA's remit and policy decisions remain a matter for the relevant Minister and Government.  NewERA has, however, developed in conjunction with the relevant Department, a shareholder's expectations framework to aid the alignment of objectives between the State and the relevant commercial State entity in relation to dividends, shareholder returns, policy objectives, as defined by the Departments, and reporting requirements.<\/p> <p>NewERA has conducted a range of activities in the areas of corporate finance and governance advice, State asset disposal and restructuring and facilitation of investment in economic infrastructure in its first two years of operation.  Details of these activities are set out in the briefing note forwarded to the committee.<\/p><p> Stepping away from the capital markets, the NTMA also performs claims and risk management functions on behalf of the State acting as the State Claims Agency.  The State Claims Agency has a significant claims portfolio of over 6,000 claims under management, with an estimated liability at 31 December 2013 of &euro;1.2 billion.  These are large numbers, as indeed are most of the figures relating to the work of the NTMA, but we are always conscious of the fact that there are individuals behind these figures.  The nature of its work puts the State Claims Agency in the unenviable position of dealing with distressing cases of personal trauma and loss, sometimes within the constraints of the adversarial court system.  In doing so, it seeks to fulfil its statutory duty to represent the interests of the State in a fair and respectful manner.  It is in this context that the State Claims Agency resolves the majority of clinical claims by negotiating a settlement either directly or via mediation, with just 3% of clinical claims ending up in the courts.  The State Claims Agency views mediation as a preferable alternative to the adversarial courts system, particularly in clinical negligence cases.<\/p><p> Since its establishment in 1990 as a single-function debt management agency, governments have given the NTMA a range of additional responsibilities.  I have touched on three of these in my opening remarks this morning.  In addition, the National Development Finance Agency and the National Asset Management Agency have their own accountable persons and are not the subject of this morning's agenda.  As a result of the progressive addition of these extra functions over the years, the NTMA's current governance structure comprises a number of boards and committees overseeing its work.  The legislation to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and to put NewERA on a statutory footing provides an opportune moment to streamline and update this unwieldy governance structure.  The Government's proposed legislative changes, which are based on proposals made by the NTMA, will establish a single, overarching NTMA board to oversee all of the NTMA&rsquo;s functions, with the exception of NAMA, which will continue to have its own separate governance structure.  This board, which is to be chaired by Mr. Willie Walsh, who is the chief executive of the International Airlines Group, will greatly assist in the delivery of the NTMA's objectives in an integrated and coherent manner.  I thank the members of the committee for their attention.  My colleagues and I will be happy to address any questions they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392255000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Corrigan.

The proposition that was presented to the NPRF did not represent a bankable proposition, in the view of the NPRF commission, in the absence of a regulatory and pricing regime.  There was no stream of income to support it.  An amendment was made to the Irish Water legislation to empower the Government to guarantee to the NPRF any loan the NPRF commission might decide to make.

I wanted to get the mechanics of it on the record.  Many people have debated where this money came from.  We knew the NPRF had a role in this regard, as it had specifically referred to this money in its annual account.<\/p><p>  I would like to ask a few questions about the State Claims Agency.  I raised this issue with the witnesses when they were here previously.  We heard some fine words in the opening remarks.  I want to ask about a much-publicised case that came to a conclusion in the courts last year.  All of this matter is on the public record.  I refer to the very sad case of a six year old boy in Waterford, Dylan Gaffney Hayes, whose parents had to take the agency to the High Court.  An award of &euro;8.5 million was made in November on foot of the catastrophic brain injuries that Dylan suffered at the time of his birth.  We would like to extend all the good wishes we can to his parents, Jean and Thomas, with the difficult life they have ahead of them from here on in.  According to the family, the obstetrician said to them at the time that \"there would be no cover up\" and \"we will not be defending this\".  Despite this, the State Claims Agency threatened them with legal costs all along the way.  They lodged their claim, but to their surprise, the State Claims Agency denied everything and took them to court.  They were ultimately awarded &euro;8.25 million.  We must remember that this boy suffered catastrophic brain injuries at birth.  It was clear that he would require phenomenal care during the first six years of his life.  It was important that his housing needs were met to cater for his difficulties.<\/p> <p>They did ask for a payment on account to cover some housing needs and I understand the State Claims Agency refused to make an interim payment on account.  The following week a similar case concerning another hospital involving several million euro came before the courts.  Ms Justice Mary Irvine made remarks about the conduct of the State Claims Agency which was defending the case.  She said it was the second similar case to come before her that week where the HSE had delayed admitting liability.  This caused additional stress and fear for the children and families involved.  Why does the State Claims Agency do that to people when the obstetrician was quite clear from early on?  What the judge said is clear, that the State Claims Agency's delayed payment probably jeopardised the family's financial position and ability to care for young Dylan during those six years.  I am sure the file was sitting on some shelf.  How does one justify that?  I ask this because it is a case that has been completed in the courts.  Has the State Claims Agency paid out that money to them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300012#L02100","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392255600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that when a couple such as the Gaffney Hayes come before the court in the way they did in November, it is an extraordinarily difficult time for them.  We understand that.  For us, managing the litigation poses different stresses and approaches but for them the whole case was fraught with emotion.  The Deputy has raised a couple of points in the context of that case that I think I should address, which are matters of record at this stage.  I cannot go into, without prejudice, settlement negotiations because we never talk about those.  It is true that the obstetrician indicated that he certainly felt that the case was not defendable initially, shortly after the birth.  The fact of the matter was that we did not get the personal injuries summons until 26 October 2010.  Notwithstanding what the obstetrician might think about it, and clearly his view is very important and one that determines our approach to the case, we are also obliged to take expert evidence to examine the care that was given in the particular instance.  In September 2011, our reports which indicated that, clearly, there had been a breach of duty of care, actually admitted the breach of duty on that date, 27 September 2011.  There was an additional issue.  It is quite complex when one looks at the causation issues in cerebral palsy cases but an issue was left over and we were awaiting some reports.  On 7 June 2012 we admitted liability in full and on that date - 7 June 2012 - invited the solicitors for the Gaffney Hayes family to meet us for, without prejudice, settlement discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1392255600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Was the agency admitting liability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300013#M00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392255600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Sorry, no.

As Mr. John Corrigan stated in his opening remarks, it is a preference for us that we would go the route of mediation.  In the particular case the family refused mediation and we decided we would go back to court because there is a facility to get the High Court judge to order mediation.  We did that on 3 October 2013.  The mediation failed.  We made a substantial offer at the mediation and the mediation failed.  The matter was then listed, as it would normally be, before the High Court in November.  A very tricky issue then arose, and while the family might be aware of it, it is also a very technical legal argument, in relation to real rate of return concerning the cost of future care.  In the particular case, the counsel for the plaintiff indicated to the court that he was seeking to bring economic argument before the court as to why that rate should be reduced.  We decided that for good reasons, based on our own economic evidence, that we would be putting that matter at issue.

When did the State Claims Agency become aware of this case and its adverse medical situation?  Is Mr. Breen saying that the start of the agency's dealings with the case was when it was issued with a court summons?  Can the mediation not commence when the agency becomes aware of the event and vests its liability?  Does the agency sit back?

In that particular case we went to an early mediation with the family based on a substantial letter of claim and, in fact, settled that matter well prior to when a summons might be issued.<\/p><p>  We get about 80,000 adverse incidents notified to us every year.  Once we get letters of claim in, if we can at all, we try to move to settle the cases at the earliest opportunity.

Mr. Breen has said that the agency's main objective is to ensure the expenses relating to the management of cases are contained.  Another objective is to work with the authorities at reducing costs.  If these are the agency's two main objectives, it has failed on them.  We thought the agency was set up to reduce the figure of over &euro;1 billion down to between &euro;800,000 and &euro;600,000, but the figure is going in the wrong direction and Mr. Breen is presiding over that.<\/p><p>  I know he will say he has no control over the number of claims, but the number of claims outstanding each year is rising.  Therefore, the agency is not even remotely near dealing with the number of claims being made.  The claims are just piling up, which extends the timescale for cases.  The liability to the State is rising every year, 36% of an increase in the past three years alone.

However, with regard to employer's liability, public liability and property damage which is what the injuries board deals with, we settle many of our cases within very short time lines of months with plaintiffs and their lawyers, without any fuss.  The reason we can do that is because of the kind of cases which present.  These are cases involving things like road traffic collisions.  In my view and based on my experience over 30 years of managing both clinical negligence cases and ordinary road traffic-type cases, one is not comparing like with like.  For example, in clinical negligence cases one is dealing with the reputations of doctors, nurses and of other skilled practitioners in hospitals.  Those cases are not amenable to that kind of easy decision-making as in a case, for example, if I collide into the back of the Deputy's car, that clearly I am liable.  It is a much more complex array of factors.  For that very good reason, we did an exercise in discussions with the injuries board and we indicated to it that we felt that there was probably only in the order of about 3% of our clinical negligence cases that we felt they could take over and handle in the kind of efficient way it works.  We do exactly the same with that 3% of cases.  We handle them as efficiently as we can, delivering compensation in the shortest period of time.  It is a policy issue, as the Deputy says, about whether the injuries board has medical negligence cases.  I think that if medical negligence cases go to the injuries board our work will increase, not decrease, because in every case where the injuries board comes back to us and ask us about the liability position, we are going to have to commission medical records from hospitals and this will create a resourcing issue for hospitals and indeed for us.  There are many complicated issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1392257400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>When does Mr. Breen's office have sight of an original medical report file, as, for example, in the Gaffney case?

The first of these relates to State Street Bank, in respect of which he provided quite a lengthy analysis in his submission to the committee.  At the end of January, State Street was found to have committed major transgressions by the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.  When Mr. Corrigan was previously before the committee he stated that, effectively, the activity in which the bank was involved was fraudulent and unacceptable.  State Street defrauded the State to the tune of &euro;3.2 million, which was four and a half times the original agreed figure of just under &euro;700,000.  This matter arose in October 2011 when the our guests became aware of a particular media report and contacted State Street.  That institution appeared to have been continuing to manage a fund on the NPRF's behalf until quite recently.  Why was that the case?  If the activity in which State Street was engaged was deemed to be fraudulent, why did the NPRF not pull its business immediately?  How much money was State Street responsible for managing up until recently and when did the NPRF eventually pull its business?  Why did the agency not end its association with the bank over two years ago?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014021300017#Q02200","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392258000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>In 2012, I explained to the committee that we would await the report of the Financial Conduct Authority in order to identify what was the root cause of this behaviour and what were the failings within State Street.

On 14 November of that year it acknowledged that there were problems.  In December 2011 it had agreed that a mark-up had been applied in respect of the original fixed fee of &euro;698,000 - bringing it up to &euro;2.65 million - and that this was fraudulent.  In March 2012 the position was reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers in Boston which stated that the amount was &euro;2.61 million, slightly less than the &euro;2.65 million indicated by State Street.  In July 2012 State Street indicated that when it had considered the position again, it discovered it had avoided taking any risk on the transaction and, therefore, owed the NTMA a further &euro;600,000, or $727,000.  On 21 August 2012 the NTMA requested an independent investigation and State Street indicated that there might be problems with transition 4 rather than transition 14.  The NTMA then referred the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and stated at that point that it would accept all the figures but that they were still subject to independent verification.

On the point the Vice Chairman raised, as chairman of the commission, that point struck us.  The NTMA was managing the fund.  It was a matter of major concern that something so serious was happening - so much so that, in fairness to the management, the commission said to go and make sure we get the top person from State Street to come over here and explain this situation.  Hindsight is a great thing, as we all know, but the facts the Vice Chairman has raised were the same issues that concerned me.  Having a professional background as an accountant, it is always better to make sure one has all the facts before one jumps in and does something.  We did not have all the facts at that time.  The more important aspect was that, in monitoring this and in talking to the NTMA, there were other issues taking place on the sideline where the certain people who were the culprits here - the staff - were taking cases to a tribunal for unfair dismissal.  One did not know exactly what was going on and whether those people had a case.  The other question was how high up this went within the organisation of State Street and how could one get a balanced judgment without having all the facts on the table.<\/p><p>  The second point is that in terms of what happens now, the commission still has to consider what detriment was suffered here and what other detriment could have been suffered by the NTMA and the pension fund in this regard.  Therefore, that requires some more input from the NTMA to the commission to ascertain what detriment was suffered and if there is there any further action that has to be considered.  That is still a work in progress.  It still has to be dealt with, but the points that, quite correctly, have come to Vice Chairman's mind have come to the commission and we made a balanced judgment at the time to wait until we had all the facts.

This is particularly the case in obstetrics, where one would see cerebral palsy cases, which are much more expensive, coming through only a number of years afterwards.  For example, cerebral palsy cases are capable of being diagnosed only when the infant is two years of age.  Prior to that, one cannot make what is called an absolute diagnosis.  The lag time in terms of the cost of the claims suddenly began to kick in.

Since December, there has been series of extreme storm events around the coast which have caused significant damage to infrastructure on our coastline and to publicly owned harbours, piers, slipways and related infrastructure.  As of last Friday, the Department estimated that damage had occurred in more than 100 piers, harbours and slipways and other coastal infrastructure linked to fisheries and aquaculture.  The damage has been done primarily to smaller piers, harbours and slipways.  The fishery harbour centres in Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveal and Killybegs did not suffer serious damage, although there was some damage in Dunmore East.<\/p><p>  The latest storm first hit the west coast yesterday morning.  Wave height was severe but it did not initially coincide with a high tide and that made a difference around the coast.  However, there is a strong likelihood that these storms may continue over the weekend and, therefore, we are not sure if we are at the end of this spate of storms.  The situation continues to evolve.<\/p><p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was represented on, and contributed to, the national co-ordination group on severe weather, which was convened to assess the impact of the storms on infrastructure and communities and to ensure a co-ordinated response by relevant local authorities, Departments and agencies.  Most of the harbours and piers around the coast that have been adversely affected by the recent storms are owned by the relevant local authority, and responsibility for their repair and maintenance rests with them in the first instance.  However, the Department accepts that it has a key role to play in the Government's response to damage to publicly owned, fishery related piers, harbours and slipways around the coast.  We also acknowledge that the OPW retains overall responsibility for the Government's response in regard to coastal erosion, coastal defence and flood defence projects generally.  Our focus is on the piers, harbours and slipways linked to fisheries and aquaculture around the coast, and there are many of those.<\/p><p>  A prime consideration for the Department is the dependence of a large proportion of the Irish fishing fleet, particularly our 1,900 inshore vessels, on the network of local authority-owned piers and harbours for their operational activities.  With that consideration, and as part of our annual capital fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme, we have run a limited scheme co-funding the repair and upgrade of local authority-owned harbours linked to fisheries and aquaculture.  This has been a small scheme.<\/p><p>  As part of its overall co-ordinated response to the impact of the recent unprecedented weather conditions, the Government has decided to allocate an additional &euro;8.8 million for the repair of our publicly owned harbour network linked to fisheries and aquaculture.  This is a significant amount, given current economic circumstances, and it is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to rural coastal communities dependent on this infrastructure and to the wider fishing sector.  It is also part of the overall Government response to the storms.<\/p><p>  While it is difficult to be definitive at this stage, the Department's engineers have engaged since the storm period began in an extensive consultation process with local authority engineers, and the estimate as of last Friday is that more than 100 piers, harbours and slipways across nine counties had experienced damage.  That damage varies from relatively light to relatively severe.  In the context of the additional funds now available, the Minister announced in the D&aacute;il yesterday that it is proposed to broaden the scope of the Department's 2014 capital programme to encompass to the greatest extent possible repair works on publicly owned, fishery and aquaculture related piers, slipways and infrastructure in harbours damaged by the storms.<\/p><p>  It is intended in the coming days to invite local authorities to apply for co-funding under this programme.  Co-funding traditionally has been provided at a rate of 75% of the cost incurred in carrying out the project, but the Minister has decided in the circumstances to increase this rate to 90%.  The invitation to local authorities will ask them prioritise a list of eligible projects on a county-by-county basis for consideration for funding the repair of the damage caused by the recent storms.  This funding will be focused on infrastructural repairs to fisheries and aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways.  A number of normal, general criteria will apply to the scheme to ensure value for money is achieved in the design, implementation and execution of the repair works.  Traditionally, the upper limit for support has been &euro;150,000 per project because these are small projects, but that cap will be removed for this special scheme.<\/p><p>  In addition to the funding to be provided to local authorities, the Department will be moving to repair storm damage to piers, harbours and coastal infrastructure in its direct ownership.  Some coastal infrastructure in the direct ownership of the Department has also been damaged, and the Department will move through its engineering division as quickly as possible to repair the significant storm damage to the north harbour in Cape Clear that occurred in January, the breakwater in the Dunmore East fishery harbour centre in County Waterford, the Gun Rock beacon on Inishbofin, which was damaged ten days or two weeks ago, the West Cove navigational beacon in County Kerry, and Dooagh pier in County Mayo.<\/p><p>  An evaluation committee will consider the eligibility of all local authority applications and decide on the basis of overall priorities and in the context of the total budget available the projects the Minister may consider for approval.  In addition to this scheme to address the damage to the smaller piers and harbours around the coast, Bord lascaigh Mhara, working with the Department, has been producing consistent reports from around the coast of loss or destruction of lobster and shrimp pots owned by inshore fishermen during the extreme winter storm events.  While some loss of pots is normal during the winter months, it is thought that the scale of losses this year is exceptional.  It is understood that pots deployed in shallower waters have been most affected, but what makes this year more exceptional has been the loss of pots stored on quaysides.  Reports indicate that many pots were washed off piers by the ferocity of waves and either destroyed or swept out to sea.<\/p><p>  The pot fishermen affected by these losses are small-scale coastal fishermen.  The majority of vessels are under 10 metres in length and many are open or just half decked vessels.  In many cases, they are crewed by the owner or perhaps one other crew member.  These fishermen primarily fish lobster, crab and other shellfish.  With the loss of pots, the means of any fisherman affected to make a living is severely threatened.  If they cannot replace their lost pots and return to fishing, they risk becoming unemployed.<\/p><p>  With regard to the prioritisation of available funding, this situation has been examined closely.  In considering assistance to these pot fishermen for their losses, the Minister announced yesterday he would move to address this.  It is not possible for many of these fishermen to obtain insurance to cover loss of pots.  Yesterday, the Minister announced in the D&aacute;il a temporary, once-off scheme of assistance to these pot fishermen for the replacement of lobster and shrimp pots lost or destroyed in the recent extreme storm events.<\/p> <p>The scheme will be focused on smaller inshore fishermen, limited to vessels under 15 m and will be administered by BIM, Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It will provide a set amount of &euro;24 per lost lobster pot lost and &euro;12 per lost shrimp pot.  These amounts represent approximately 40% of the cost of replacement of such gear.  The Department is conscious that some pot fishermen have reported losing several hundred pots.  These are exceptional cases, however.  Accordingly, the number of replacement pots for under 12 m vessels will be capped at 50 and for those vessels between 12 m and 15 m it will be capped at 100 pots.  So a fisherman who has lost 100 pots at a replacement cost of approximately &euro;6,000 will receive assistance of &euro;2,400.<\/p><p> Fishermen availing of this scheme will be required to provide certain evidence to BIM to show they were actively pot fishing in the months before the storms, as well as evidence of purchase of the pots that were lost.  In addition, they will be required to make a declaration concerning their losses.  A maximum budget of &euro;1.5 million has been set aside for the purposes of the scheme, to be borne by the existing Vote of the Department.  No additional funding will be made available.  Should applications exceed this budget, the rate of assistance will be reduced, either in terms of the amount of payment per pot or in terms of the maximum number of pots.  We do not expect this to be the case, however.  Further details of this scheme will be made available from BIM shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021300004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392286500,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Beamish.

What about public piers and slipways that are not?  Some of these are damaged and are important for local use.  I know Galway&rsquo;s local authority has submitted non-local authority infrastructure that is public for repair.  Will these be considered?<\/p><p>  I accept the Department&rsquo;s remit covers fisheries.  Some small piers are used by traditional and recreational boats which still create an economic return.  Will the Department omit these from consideration?  There are many small seawalls and sluices all around the coast, some of them built by the Congested Districts Board, which were very effective but have been damaged and need to be replaced.  Is the OPW or the Department responsible for these?  I can see months of turf wars going on over these cheap but important infrastructures.  There is one at Clooncullaun that has been damaged.  The one at Ballyconneely collapsed and, as a result, it caused the flooding of a house that would never have flooded otherwise.  The sea defences for the airstrip at Inis Me&aacute;in have been destroyed, which could result in the airstrip becoming unusable if the tide breaches the runway.  How do we mediate the disputes that will arise between the various agencies passing the ball on these kinds of works?<\/p> <p> I welcome the extra funding of &euro;8.8 million.  Of course, the next question is the logistics of spending the money.  I presume that some of the work is so big that it will be necessary to go to design stage and then to tender stage.  In those cases the Department will be lucky to spend any money this year.  No matter what promise I am given here today, I would be very sceptical that much of the money that is going into design and tender will actually be spent this year.<\/p><p> However, a large number of piers and harbours have been damaged where less work involved, and it is more a matter of putting back what was there and repairing them.  As we all know, if a few boulders come out of a pier, particularly some of the older stone piers, it is like when a geansa&iacute; or jersey starts to rip in that if nothing is done about it very quickly, the pier will become vulnerable to any kind of adverse weather.  Will permission be given to the local authorities to take a shortcut version to getting repairs done, in other words, emergency works?  Will that all be direct labour or will the local authorities be able to hire on a quick system, in other words, get the person in on the job to actually begin the repairs quickly?  Otherwise, we can throw all the money we want on the table but we will not see anything before next Christmas.<\/p><p> I am worried about the issue of co-funding, even at a rate of 10%.  It would be fair to say Donegal nearly went to the wire over its estimates this year and the council nearly got replaced.  The question is what happens if a local authority comes and says to the Department that it will not put up the 10% and it is not going to do the work, even though that work needs to be done.  We could get into the type of turf war that can happen in regard to co-funding.  Is there an obligation on the local authorities to come up with the funding, and where are they meant to get the money for co-funding?  My understanding is that the only source of their own funds, if one could call them their own funds, is a grant from the local property tax and the raising of rates, but that is not elastic and they have no control over either.  What happens if they eyeball the Department and say they do not have the co-funding?<\/p><p> I welcome the inclusion of the Gun Rock Beacon on Inishbofin.

Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I welcome the &euro;8.8 million extra that has been allocated but given the extent of the damage that has been done, I do not believe it will go next or near to addressing the problem.  Dr. Beamish mentioned that up to last Friday, some 100 piers were affected.  How many of those piers are owned and regulated by the local authorities and what percentage are in public ownership but not under the auspices of the local authorities?<\/p><p>  Many marinas have been damaged.  Does the funding also include them?  A huge aspect is the rock armour protecting piers and slipways and which also forms part of the breakwaters which give access to people coming into small piers.  Great damage has been done to this, given the huge swell as well as the storms.  Again, is that rock armour also included in what Dr Beamish has discussed?  Dr. Beamish said there had traditionally been an upper limit of &euro;150,000 per project and that this cap has been removed.  Is there a new upper limit above that?<\/p><p>  I believe it will be almost impossible to get adequate funding to meet the demands out there, given what the OPW and the local authorities will be looking for as well.  Will there be an acceptance of local community support?   With regard to the question of sand dunes and so forth, which is not the responsibility of the of the Department but of the OPW, there will be a need for community support in trying to repair the enormous damage that has been done.  I am speaking in particular of areas like Fenit, Rossbeigh, Banna, Ballyheigue and so forth.<\/p><p>  In addition, an issue that is not yet apparent, but which will become apparent when the work begins, is the amount of structural damage that has been done under the water line.  This will require a survey of piers and slipways, because the slipways in particular have been hugely damaged underneath the water line.  All of this will have to be assessed and factored in if piers and slipways are to be repaired to their original standard.<\/p><p>  The local authorities have to come up with 10% of the funding themselves and I do not know where they are going to get it because they are absolutely strapped for cash.

There is also the question of lead-in costs for design work, consents and the like.  Unless this has also been lifted, the local authorities will have to carry that cost before they can apply for funding to the Department.  I would like further explanation in that regard.<\/p><p>  The allocation of funding towards fishing gear and lobster pots is totally inadequate, and I am sure other speakers will cover this issue during the questions.  I know some fishermen have lost nets and fishing gear but there is no sign of any scheme to help them replace that gear.  Is this an issue to which the Department will give consideration?

The provision of &euro;8.8 million for nine counties is significant.  I do not share the concerns that have been expressed regarding the ability of local authorities to come up with 10%, or &euro;800,000, of that sum nationally.  If it is spread equally across the nine counties, the requirement will be somewhere in the region of &euro;80,000 to &euro;90,000 per local authority.  My experience with Cork County Council is that the chief concern was to secure national funding.  The local contribution was never an issue if the departmental funding was put in place.  If other local authorities encounter a difficulty in coming forward with their 10% contribution, I am sure Cork County Council will be happy to lift a heavier share of the burden.  Will the delegates indicate how the estimate of &euro;8.8 million was reached?  Was it based on preliminary assessment figures submitted by local authorities in the past month?  If so, I assume it does not take into account any damage that was done in recent days.<\/p><p>  An issue of concern, in the context of the increased activity that will take place after the moneys are allocated under the capital scheme, is that there are not many contractors who are skilled in these types of marine infrastructure projects.  It is not run-of-the-mill construction work, with people having to work with tides, underwater and so on.  Has the Department done any assessment of how the specialised nature of the work might affect the tendering process and the financial implications arising therefrom?  If there are insufficient numbers of qualified contractors, will that have the effect of bumping up prices?<\/p><p>  Are there any issues regarding planning approvals, planning applications or foreshore licences which might cause delays on any of the projects?  Was any assessment done of whether overlaps arise in terms of projects submitted under the scheme having been previously submitted as priority projects for local authorities in recent years?  It seems logical, for example, that some of the piers that were damaged in recent days were already damaged to some degree and already requiring repair.

To clarify, is this allocation part of the &euro;70 million provision the Government announced after the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday or in addition to it?<\/p><p>  Dr. Beamish made the distinction that coastal protection works are a matter for the Office of Public Works while piers and so on are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I wish it were that straightforward and clear-cut.  I have correspondence to hand going back to 1989 between Noel Treacy, the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Brendan Daly, the then Minister for the Marine, and the then secretary of Clare County Council.  That correspondence went back to Mr. Treacy and subsequently to John P. Wilson, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for the Marine.  All three organisations - the OPW, Clare County Council and the then Department of the Marine - seemed intent on disowning responsibility for the particular works that were the subject of this correspondence, which are located in an area called Tromra Castle in Quilty.  They were included in a 1992 report compiled by the County and City Managers Association detailing emergency coastal works which required immediate attention.  The total projected cost of completing all of those works was some &pound;14 million in 1992, or approximately &euro;17.5 million.  Successive governments chose to ignore that report and now the bill for Clare alone is &euro;35 million.<\/p><p>  Many of the works to which I am referring - culverts and sluice gates in particular - were built by the Land Commission, the successor to which, as I understand it, is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In theory, therefore, these works would be the responsibility, to the extent they are the responsibility of anybody, of that Department.  Likewise, there is a series of culverts in low-lying areas across the west coast of Clare which are also the subject of correspondence and which everybody is seeking to disown bar the unfortunate landowners who, in some instances, are afraid to touch them because to do so might constitute interference with a special area of conservation.  Some of these landowners have had visits from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p><p>  I have outlined the issues in west Clare.  On the Fergus Estuary, meanwhile, there is a large number of embankments, some of which are the responsibility of the OPW and on which work has been carried out by the latter.  However, some are also Land Commission works and now vest, as I understand, in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I appreciate that the delegates will not have an answer today, but I would like to know that somebody is working to ensure a unified response to the problem.  These embankments and culverts were put there for a reason by either the Land Commission or the OPW, and they need to be maintained.  I hope another Deputy is not sitting in this chair in 25 years time going over a ream of correspondence between various Ministers intent on disowning responsibility for the works.

I would like to see a copy of the state aid rules wherein it is stated that in the event of a tremendous storm, state aid cannot be given to people who have lost property that was not insurable.<\/p><p>  I understand the following issue is a matter for another Department.  The committee will need to bring to the attention of the relevant Minister the issue of fishermen who have not been able to earn any money or obtain social welfare payments for, in some cases, eight weeks or more.  People cannot live without money.<\/p><p>  I have a number of points to make on this section.  First, I believe all gear should be covered.  Places where people have stored things for generations were washed away with the tide.  It was totally unprecedented so it was not carelessness.  For a person who has a lot of pots to move them to other land every year would require him or her to hire a lorry to do that.  In many places they are pulled well up from the tide and stored.  In fairness to local rural people, they tend to know where the danger lies and how to avoid it.  That very few rural houses were flooded is reflective of their ability to know where best to build their homes, in particular, older houses.  <\/p><p>  Second, to my way of thinking the 40% is totally inadequate in the context of a person having to come up with &euro;3,600 and the number of days fishing required to meet that cost.  It is amazing that we can give 90% to a local authority, in respect of which I anticipate a problem will arise, and yet we can give only 40% to fishermen and that even that 40% will be only given in limited circumstances.  I believe there should be one limit, namely, 100 pots and a boat under 12 m.  The size of a boat is often a factor in the type of sea in which a person fishes.  Some fish in big sheltered bays, of which there are many in Connemara.  I cannot understand the reason for the differentiation or the reason a person who had 100 pots or a boat under 12 m is not compensated for same.  In my view, the percentage is very low.<\/p><p>  If I went around the country and asked people who had purchased household furniture in the past four years to produce a receipt for it, I am sure they might not have it.  Evidence of purchase of pots that were lost will be hard to come by.  While the response may be that the receipts would have been needed for tax returns purposes, many of the people about whom we are speaking have never in their lives filed tax returns.  I accept they should, however, have retained them for the purposes of means testing and so on.  They often do not realise that a receipt for &euro;100 is as good as a &euro;100 cheque to them.  We have to face realities.  Many small fishermen do not have these receipts.  The Department is aware of how much each of them sold because most of them sell to registered buyers.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021300010#J01600","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392289500,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021300010#J01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish"},{"type":"speech","time":1392289500,"counter":587,"content":"<p>It is fair to say then that if they sold a lot of shrimps or lobsters, they had to have a fair number of pots.  In my view instead of saying, as did Dr. Beamish in his opening statement, that, in addition, they will be required to make a sworn declaration concerning their losses, we should say that as long as they produce evidence that they were doing the fishing, and they produce the pots and so on, they will be paid.  The scheme is very limited anyway.  I would rather a higher grant for a fixed number of pots than a lower grant for more pots.  Allowance must be made for realities.  We are all aware of the realities that are going to jump up and bite people in this regard thus making the scheme a very cheap one because many people will find it impossible to produce receipts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021300010#J01800","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1392289500,"counter":588,"content":"<p>It is important the skippers and crews of the white fish boats that have been tied up for some three months now, who up to now have not received one cent, which as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said may be the responsibility of another Department, are provided with some income.  I would like to see both Departments working together to ensure that applications for social welfare by these people are fast tracked.  Perhaps the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would confirm to the Department of Social Protection its acceptance that people have not been at sea since mid-December and have had no income whatsoever.<\/p><p>  Quite a lot of damage has been caused to boats.  Also, many boats sank and need to be raised.  Anybody who is familiar with raising boats, in particular from a harbour, repairing it and getting it fit for fishing again will be aware that part of the cost involved in that regard is the hire of cranes from the harbour board to lift boats from the water and the renting of space to carry out the repair works and so on.  Could consideration be given to this from a local authority point of view?  Local authorities must co-fund projects to the tune of 10%.  Could such works be written off as part of that 10%, which would obviously be passed on to boat owners, many of whom will have also lost fishing gear such as gill nets, lobster, shrimp and crayfish pots?  Could consideration be given to the writing off of the cost of hire of harbour board cranes and space in respect of the raising and repair work of boats?<\/p> <p>Will that be part of the 10% contribution from the local authorities?<\/p><p> Fishermen have lost a considerable amount of gear.  Since just before Christmas they have had to put up with nine storms in a row, which is unprecedented in my lifetime.  Obviously we do not yet know the extent of the damage from last night's one.  There are people who cannot get near their equipment and do not know what they have lost yet.  They have not been to sea for weeks and do not know the damage that has been done.  In a normal swell whether in shallow water or deep water, people can be fairly certain that the deep water gear would not be badly damaged but shallow water gear would be damaged with a bad swell.  However, after what we have been through in the past three to four weeks regardless of the depth of water, there will be huge damage.<\/p><p> It is not just the pots they have lost, but also the damage done to pots that they might be able to recover afterwards.  I know people will try to repair pots if possible so that they can go back fishing again.  There are caps in support of 50 and 100 pots for vessels of up to 12 m and vessels between 12 m and 15 m.  If people have lost 600, 700 or 800 pots, that represents &euro;36,000 to &euro;40,000 worth of fishing gear.  We know they are struggling to keep fishing.  They are not in a position to replace what they have lost.  Further consideration needs to be given regarding compensation for people who have lost all their gear and are not in a position to replace it.  It can cost &euro;60, &euro;65 or &euro;70 for soft eye pots.  A fisherman who has lost 600 of those is down &euro;36,000.  What lending institution will give &euro;36,000 to someone who has been struggling all along to make ends meet?  The Department needs to review that to see if something further can be done in that regard.<\/p><p> Those who are fishing and potting over the winter are fishing for the Christmas market and the Easter market.  At that time they can get &euro;22 to &euro;24 per kg, whereas in the middle of summer it comes down to &euro;8 to &euro;10 per kg.  People take a chance on fishing at that time because that is how they can make the extra few bob.  The people involved have been wiped out now.  It is not 50 pots they have lost, but 500 to 800 pots.  That issue needs to be given more consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021300010#J01900","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392290100,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I welcome any scheme that gives assistance.

My name is Patrick McGowan.  I am the head of the Irish delegation and represent the north west.  I will share my presentation with a number of my colleagues, Councillors McDonnell, Hanniffy and O'Donoghue.<\/p><p>  The Committee of the Regions was established in 1994 to represent local and regional government in the EU decision-making process.  In April, it will celebrate its 20th anniversary.  Over the years, its status and powers have been enhanced by successive EU treaties.  As an advisory body composed of elected representatives, the committee provides other EU institutions with a view and experiences of local and regional levels of government.  Under the Lisbon treaty, the Committee of the Regions is limited to 350 members from the 28 EU member states, with an equal number of alternative members.  The committee's mandate is set at five years.  The current term will continue to the beginning of 2015.<\/p><p>  The Committee of the Regions presents its views as detailed written opinions in response to legislative and other proposals from the European Commission or requests from the Council and Parliament.  However, the committee can also issue opinions and resolutions on its own initiative.  Annually, the Committee of the Regions adopts approximately 70 opinions across a range of EU policy issues, such as economics, social policy, territorial cohesion, education and training, transport, environment, energy, agriculture, etc.  It encompasses most major issues.  Once adopted, opinions are forwarded to the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and other interested parties for consideration at the decision-making stages.<\/p><p>  The wide range of opinion is indicative of the range of competences of the EU and the increasing demands on the committee's members.  While the committee's opinions are advisory and non-binding, it is usually the first to respond to a Commission proposal and, as such, our opinions highlight particular issues and influence the debate in other institutions.  Members of the Commission and the European Parliament and representatives of the European Presidency participate in Committee of the Regions meetings, approximately 90% of which are held in Brussels.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Councillor McDonnell, will say a few words about the work of the Irish delegation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Councillor Patrick McGowan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392300000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>While membership of the Committee of the Regions is determined by the member states, the committee increasingly works within political groups, mirroring the European Parliament.  There are five political groups in the committee, with Irish members represented in four.  Nevertheless, the Irish delegation generally works in a unified and co-ordinated manner to represent the interests of the Irish local government sector and to promote and defend national interests.<\/p><p>  Across the EU, a significant amount of legislation is implemented at local or regional level.  In Ireland, this mainly involves environmental issues, with legislation such as that on habitats, water quality, environmental impact assessments, energy efficiency, landfills and recycling, but also issues of procurement policy, health and safety, working hours, payments and so on.  These are just some of the issues affecting Irish local and regional authorities.  However, local and regional government in Ireland is responsible for a limited range of functions compared with other member states.  Quite a number of the European Commission's policy proposals may not be directly relevant, such as fiscal issues and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, but we defend national interests in such discussions.<\/p><p>  Compared with our colleagues from other member states, we operate within a number of constraints.  The lack of a well resourced, policy-focused national association of local government places us at a disadvantage.  Colleagues from other member states often benefit from such associations' well developed positions on key policy initiatives.<\/p> <p>At local level it was a concern that there seemed to be either a widespread lack of awareness or of interest in the EU policy-making process.  This may be because there is a lack of structural engagement as, apart from members of the Committee of the Regions and aside from implementing some EU-funded projects, local government is rarely consulted on or informed of relevant EU developments.  These are issues that may need to be addressed by local government in the first instance but could also be addressed by the Government, the Oireachtas and possibly by this committee in its report on Ireland and the future of the EU.  Despite the structural weakness, as members of the Committee of the Regions, we have the support of a delegation secretary with one officer in Dublin and one in Brussels and we also receive some support from our local and regional authorities and regional assemblies.  As members will know, these regional entities are scheduled for reorganisation as part of the current local government reform process and this may provide an opportunity to examine these issues in the round.<\/p><p> We maintain contacts with the Irish permanent representation in Brussels and that is extremely useful for getting a steer on key Irish interests.  We are anxious that this direct link be maintained and enhanced because, as Irish representatives in Brussels, we rely on timely, insightful briefings and information.  Within our political groups we also have direct links with our colleagues in the European Parliament.  Since its inception, the Irish delegation has been very active and for its size has a high profile within the Committee of the Regions.<\/p><p> I will give some examples of our recent work.  I was Committee of the Regions rapporteur on volunteering on two occasions and other members have recently acted as rapporteurs on issues such as the small business Act, skills and education, maritime spatial planning, the strategy for the Atlantic area, shale gas and oil exploration, health inequalities, energy efficiency, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the research framework programmes, biomass, new skills in jobs and less bureaucracy for citizens, among others.  As one member acts as rapporteur on behalf of the committee in preparing each opinion, rapporteurs have an individual role as it is they who are responsible for consulting stakeholders, for drafting the Committee of the Regions response, and for steering the document through committee and plenary stages.

Since it was established in 1994, the committee has continued to evolve and strengthen its position in the various treaty revisions that took place and it also sought to broaden its remit beyond the purely advisory function which was originally provided for in the treaty.  As well as adopting opinions as an advisory body, we have been extending our influence as a political assembly and as a facilitator and we are establishing platforms to facilitate the involvement of local and regional government and authorities in discussions on key EU policy areas.<\/p><p>  One such policy area is the Europe 2020 strategy - subsidiary and cross-border co-operation.  On the Europe 2020 strategy, the Committee of the Regions is active in monitoring its implementation, which is central to virtually all the EU programmes and policies with which we are dealing up to the year 2020.  In its mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Committee of the Regions, indicated that it will advance a number of proposals on how to make the strategy more effective, how to better use EU funding resources, how to improve governance and how to improve implementation arrangements.  Many of these points are relevant to us in Ireland as participants in the European semester process, which includes the national reform programmes, or NRPs, as we refer to them.  They set out our national targets and measures to achieve the strategy's headline targets.  In Brussels our discussions, as members of the Committee of the Regions, are dominated by the Europe 2020 strategy and the European semester.  However, it is fair to say there is limited discussion of these issues in Ireland either nationally or locally.  The national reform programmes submitted by Ireland in 2010, which are reviewed annually, have not provided any meaningful or systematic consultation in the drafting stages and they have not included any local or regional dimension despite the role local authorities are meant to play and the extra roles which they will take on now, under the new local government Act, in economic development, enterprise creation and planning and sustainable development.  I would venture to say that few are aware of the NRPs.  This reinforces what my colleagues have said about a lack of informed understanding and structural engagement on EU issues.<\/p><p>  Another important issue with which we deal daily in the Committee of the Regions is subsidiarity.  Since entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, the Committee of the Regions has the right to bring an action before the European Court of Justice on grounds of infringement of the subsidiarity principle.  To this end the committee has established its own subsidiarity monitoring network to facilitate the exchange of information between the local and regional authorities in Europe regarding the various legislative proposals of the Commission.  The Irish delegation is a member of the Committee of the Regions' monitoring network and it will be very useful for us to be aware of instances whenever the Houses of the Oireachtas, whether it be the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, issue yellow cards on EU legislative proposals.  That would be certainly something that would be of benefit.<\/p><p>  The Committee of the Regions concluded an agreement with the European Parliament some weeks ago which aims to strengthen working relationships between the institutions on political and administrative matters.  This includes enhancing the linkage between the Committee of the Regions and the European Parliament committees and rapporteurs.  There will be a greater exchange of views and information from now on.  This agreement makes provision to include the participation of the Committee of the Regions and the 28 national parliaments in the European Parliament's European Parliamentary Week, which we would view as a welcome development.  Furthermore, the agreement with the European Parliament into which we have just entered introduces a territorial impact assessment procedure whereby we in the committee will seek to assess the likely impacts of proposed legislation across EU regions at NUTS 2 level.<\/p><p>  At present the European Commission is required to undertake an impact assessment on its legislative proposals.  As part of this process, it is required to assess the financial and administrative burdens that any proposal will place on either local or regional authorities.  However, the experience of the Committee of the Regions is that the Commission impact assessment process is not sufficiently robust.  Therefore, the Committee of the Regions will initiate a process of territorial impact assessment this year with a view to pushing the European Commission and the European Parliament to improve how better they take into account the impact of legislation or legislative proposals at local and regional levels.  We see this as a positive development to enhance the work of the Committee of the Regions.<\/p><p>  I would suggest that with increasing EU competencies, with the Committee of the Regions enhancing its abilities to influence  the EU decision-making process and given the restructuring of local government that is under way in this country, there is an opportunity to better represent Irish local and regional interests in the channels available.  This topic will be developed by my colleague, Councillor Paul O'Donoghue.  I thank the members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Councillor Constance Hanniffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392301200,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I will deal in my presentation with the issue of enhancement and involvement at local and regional level in the EU process.  As members of the Committee of the Regions, our experiences have given us insight into how EU policies and laws are made.  Our experiences have also shown us that at national and local government levels we could do better in terms of engagement in the process.  First, we need greater awareness in a timely fashion of what is being proposed at EU level in order that there is sufficient time to act on or react to the information provided.  We then need to use whatever expertise and experience is available to assess proposals and set out the priorities for the country and local government.  We need to avail of all the opportunities and channels to use this information to inform an Irish national approach and to use it in the EU decision-making process.  That said, we must operate within the systems that apply in Ireland and so we have three modest proposals to make to the committee, which we hope it will consider.<\/p><p>  As members will have noted, representation of the Committee of the Regions comprises members of a diverse number of political parties and none, yet we are all agreed that the three modest proposals being put forward would enhance our work in Europe and enhance interaction between us and Members of the Oireachtas.  First, we propose the establishment of a forum for EU representatives, bringing together members of this committee, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the Irish MEPs, Irish members of the Committee of the Regions and of the Economic and Social Committee and other relevant stakeholders to discuss policy issues in order that we could share insights and help develop common positions to enable Ireland to maximise its influence within the EU institutional architecture.  This initiative could be led by this committee which could initially meet to discuss identified national priorities in the European Commission's annual work programme.  Second, we recommend that the Government develop a medium-term strategy for our membership of the European Union setting out priority issues and the vision for our membership as the EU evolves.  Third, we favour a more open and structured process of consultation by all Departments on EU policy proposals.  This would help promote awareness and provide an opportunity for local government and civil society to engage on the key issues.  We suggest the European semester and the annual review of the national reform programme would be a good starting point for such a process.  That said, at local government level there is some work to be done in terms of creating awareness and of building the capacity to engage.<\/p><p>  Current discussion on the EU tends to focus either on funding or issues that cause division, including environmental protection, septic tanks and so on.  In our view, engagement on such issues at the earliest possible stage in order to shape policy could be worthwhile.  While there is some consultation between lead Departments, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the County and City Managers Association, there is no consultation at political level.  There are various avenues for input to the EU policy-making process.  It is vital that local authorities develop the capacity for EU interaction and involvement.  This will need recognition not only at political level but by the city and county managers.<\/p><p>  More active engagement in the policy-making process and better awareness of proposed EU legislation can only help when it comes to more effective transposition, implementation and compliance.  This should lead to reduced incidence of the European Commission taking Ireland to court, thus attracting fines for the country.  Specifically, in relation to better involvement of the local and new regional assemblies, we suggest that there is a role for the Oireachtas at the pre-legislative stage in establishing a more structured mechanism for consultation with local government on proposals from the European Commission that have implications at local government level.  Allied to this, the system for transposing EU legislation into national law needs to take a far more inclusive approach.  The new regional assemblies will build on the current responsibilities at regional level as managing authorities for the regional operation of programmes and in implementing EU projects by way of enhanced economic planning responsibilities.  We believe it is vital that they have the capacity to make a formalised input into assessing relevant EU legislative and policy proposals from the local and regional perspective to complement their EU funding and EU projects.  We would be pleased to assist in any way possible in facilitating better interaction of policy consultation and response through the EU national, regional and local channels.<\/p><p>  We met a number of years ago with the then committee on European scrutiny.  We had hoped for follow-on from that meeting by way of interaction between us as members of the Committee of the Regions and the members of that committee.  Unfortunately, that follow-on did not happen.  I have no doubt, given the enthusiasm of members of this committee for the European project, that there will be greater interaction into the future with the Committee of the Regions and this committee.  We believe that if we are not informed of national policy on a given issue, it will be difficult for us to represent the country in Brussels.  All nine of us, who, as I said earlier, are members of all parties and none, are anxious that detailed consideration be given to our proposals, which we believe are a modest step but one in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300005#D00100","nonspeaker":"Councillor Paul O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1392301200,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their opening statements.  I also thank them for the submission to our report on Ireland and the future of the European Union, which is useful and will form part of the document we hope to issue in a couple of weeks.  On the three proposals put forward, in particular the third proposal that we prepare a medium-term strategy for Ireland's relationship with the European Union, I see the document being produced by the committee as being a first step in that direction.  I expect the delegation would make additional submissions at future stages.<\/p><p>  On the proposal regarding more involvement by the committee in the semester process and national reform programme, that is very useful.  Last year, we met representatives of the Department of Finance to discuss the national reform programme.  The committee will examine this issue further with the officials.  What might be possible this time around, and if it works, next time around also, is attendance of one or two members of the delegation here today as witnesses at the meeting with the officials.  We will try to ensure we include a flavour from the Committee of the Regions expressed during the semester process.  It is true the semester process has only just commenced and we are in the process of ensuring it evolves into a meaningful dialogue between national parliaments and the Commission and regional representatives.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the establishment of a forum of EU representatives, I mentioned that a number of us were in Brussels earlier this week when we met MEPs.  We raised the same issue with the MEPs as the delegation has raised with us today, namely, the lack of communication on occasions.  While people are free to attend these meetings it does not on occasion suit them to do so because they are either in Strasbourg or Brussels.<\/p> <p>We are trying to find a time and it might be that we arrange a meeting every six months or every four months, which is convenient for everybody.  It might have to be on a Friday or a Monday, which might not suit everybody, but if we have a limited number of such meetings it might be possible to have them here.  That should be the forum for involving the witnesses.  I cannot speak for the Minister, but in terms of the members of the committee, MEPs and the witnesses present, it should be possible to do something.  I take Councillor O'Donoghue's point that it is something that has been suggested in the past.  It needs more work.  It might not happen before the European Parliament and local elections, but we should aim for it.  We have noticed that since the ratification of the Lisbon treaty, national parliaments have considerable power, as do the citizens through the citizens' initiative, and we need to work together to ensure we utilise them in the national interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300005#D00200","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392301800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee secretariat for organising this meeting with the Irish delegation to the Committee of the Regions.  I know all the members who have participated since 1994.  I know that the quality of the membership is extremely high.  It takes considerable commitment to go to Brussels on a regular basis which is not well recognised.  Never before has our need for such representation been greater because the reduction from 12 MEPs to 11 MEPs following Croatia's accession to the European Union is a major blow to Ireland.  The Irish delegation to the Committee of the Regions is a resource for Ireland, which should be recognised and I am glad the Chairman has done so by inviting them here today.  They should feel free to contact us on any particular issue through the secretariat.<\/p><p>  Councillors McGowan, Hanniffy and O'Donoghue, representing the group, made a presentation putting across their point of view.  Their requirements are certainly worthy of recognition.  I know that the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Donohoe, is very open to working with the group and I believe he has already met them.  If not, he certainly will be available, as he has made quite clear.  The report we received from the Irish delegation to the Committee of the Regions Brussels office contains a number of points related to the green infrastructure and other issues that come beforehand.  The submissions the delegation made have been very well recognised by the European Commission.<\/p><p>  I have no questions.  I offer my best wishes to those of the witnesses who are running for election on 23 May.  I know the time they spend on the Committee of the Regions takes them away from home and their constituencies and it is much appreciated.  I do not know how they can get more recognition, not just individually, but for their work.  Along with the MEPs they represent a vital resource, particularly for local authorities.  Local authorities should use their skills more in the future because of the reduction in the number of MEPs.<\/p><p>  The Council of Europe also has a regional forum which contains members from Ireland.  I suggest that the Chairman might consider inviting those members to appear before the committee.

As Senator Leyden said, the Irish are unquestionably very good at networking, but I am not so sure we are so good at networking with each other.<\/p><p>  I wish to pick up on some of the recommendations the delegation made.  I do not necessarily agree with Senator Leyden that losing one MEP is a blow to the country.  We are also losing councillors and Deputies; we are not losing any Senators.  Given that we are experiencing a reduction in the numbers it should encourage us to be more efficient with what we have.  We obviously have our Government, our Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, the European Parliament, the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, this committee and of course in the European Semester we also have the finance committee.  Then we have our MEPs and the Committee of the Regions.<\/p><p>  What relationship do the witnesses have with our MEPs?  Certainly there needs to be a beefing up of their relationship with this institution.  On the other side are the groups that the witnesses most overtly represent, the regional authorities and local authorities.  What is the chain of information flow?<\/p><p>  Obviously the witnesses are all out there wearing the green jersey.  However, are they seeing a significant shift towards the political parties to have a socialist ethos or a Christian democratic ethos through the EPP, the Socialist Group or the ALDE Group?<\/p><p>  The witnesses each represent different regions which have different pressures.  In most instances I know they would agree.  However, do they find there are issues on which there are challenges or differences?<\/p><p>  The first idea of the three, the medium-term strategy and the structured relationship are obvious, but the idea of the forum is quite important.  A large number of groups represent Ireland and they do great work out there.  Does everybody know what everybody else is doing, particularly in the area of yellow cards and other cards, and European scrutiny?  We are a very small country and we do not divide up the jobs as efficiently as we should do.  Perhaps the forum might be a good way, through this committee, of starting a dialogue in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300006#E00300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1392301800,"counter":621,"content":"<p>With the committee's approval, I will call Deputy Durkan next as he needs to go and make a speech in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300006#E00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1392301800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>My colleagues have been giving out to me for a long time.  I thank you, Chairman, for allowing that.  I also thank you for facilitating this meeting.  It is very important that we have what were our colleagues at some time in the past and perhaps will be our colleagues at some time in the future at local level coming before the committee.<\/p><p>  We all support the concept of more power to the regions, more power to national parliaments, more power to the European Parliament and more power to the Council.  The problem is that within that there is a division of responsibilities and authority.  To what extent will authority and responsibility be equally divided between all those groups?  As I have said many times, none of us takes full responsibility for our membership of the European Union.  We need in the regions, at local authority level, at national level and at European level, to take full responsibility and ownership of the European project.  That means we are equal to all others on the Continent of Europe within the European Union.  That means we have equal rights and equal status in every sense of the world.  That means that each region and each parliament has an equal entitlement, regardless of the numerical strength of one or the other.  Very often that tends to be forgotten.<\/p><p>  In addition and as part of that evolution, it is inevitable that there will be a debate, hidden or in the open, on the competition between all of those people in that equation as to who achieves supremacy.<\/p> <p>To my mind no one should achieve supremacy.  I believe the sum total of the contribution to be made at each level is of critical importance to the European project.  If we leave one part of it out then we fail to carry out the role and responsibility that was given to us.  If we give too much power to the European Parliament and too much <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the other components then someone will suffer.  The same applies in respect of the Council of Ministers, which effectively controls the interests of each member state.<\/p><p> There is one question and I will set it out simply.  There is a tendency to re-nationalise representation at European level.  That is not to our advantage and not to the advantage of any smaller country in any way.  It is clearly to the disadvantage of the smaller countries because once power and influence is nationalised, the bigger and more powerful countries attain supremacy.  I call on our visitors to ponder the way in which, at this level and through the aegis of the respective bodies in Europe, they promote themselves as a serious influence on the European scene without re-nationalisation or nationalising their input.  For example, there was a delegation of representatives from one European country which has a veto on the decisions of the Council.  When we asked them what jersey they wore when they issued their instructions to their Minister when it comes to voting at the Council of Ministers, which they do, they did not answer the question.  The reason they did not answer the question is because they could not answer the question since the answer was obvious.  They vote with the national jersey.  At that stage the national jersey of a particular country dominates everything else throughout the 28 member states and that should not be.  It means that each country must take ownership at national parliamentary level and at regional and local parliamentary level of the whole European project.  Each country must recognise it as part and parcel of its responsibility.  It is the responsibility of the delegation and our responsibility.  We have one thing in common within the European Union.  We have, presumably, a single objective.  We must have unity of purpose.  If we depart from that we are in difficulty because then the old adage of divide and conquer will prevail.

As Councillor O'Loughlin said, there is no structured dialogue, but in fairness, there should be a structured dialogue in place back home in Ireland for all people who represent the Irish interests on the various committees.  We also have the economic and social committee, which involves the partnership people, the trade unions, business people and so on.  There is also the Council of Europe.  I feel there should be better engagement, if only once or twice a year, and perhaps this committee could consider facilitating that.  The role of our engagement with the regional authorities and regional assemblies can sometimes be very strong.  Coming from the BMW  region, I certainly have very good, structured engagement with the regional assembly in relation to EU issues and the EU operational programmes.  I chair the monitoring committee of the EU operational programmes in that assembly region.  That engagement is there and the interaction and development of our contacts in setting and facilitating cross-border programmes is part and parcel of the work which we do through the assembly.  I am sure it happens in the southern and eastern assembly as well.<\/p><p>  I was asked if there is a shift in the COR towards a political process.  I must be honest and say that there is.  If a politician is not engaged in his or her political grouping in the COR, he or she will not bring much influence to bear on anything.  It is fair to say that.  We in Ireland, particularly Councillor Hurley, Councillor Sheahan and myself, are possibly in a more disadvantaged position than some of the others because we belong to large political groupings who have a great number of members with huge political clout across Europe.  We must throw our weight in with them and compete with them.  We have learned how to do that and we have positioned ourselves as vice chairs and vice presidents on committees, with the result that three of us are now co-ordinators on various commissions.  For two years, I was the chairperson of the last COR grouping of the high-powered Commission for Economic and Social Policy, or ECOS.  I got that through my engagement and work within the political process.<\/p><p>  Are we competing among ourselves, coming from regions with different pressures?  We all know our own issues and I think we try to bring them together as a package and try to deal with like-minded members in other delegations.  These members would come from similar regions to ourselves and might have similar problems to us.  In other words, it is about networking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Councillor Constance Hanniffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1392303000,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am probably the newest member of the COR, having only joined less than two years ago.  This is a very helpful meeting today to record the wishes of the COR members.  I believe there is a disconnect between the MEPs, regional authorities and local government level.  Perhaps that disconnect even exists with these Houses, and we need to look at that.  When people speak about EU legislation or EU directives, we often find that they are being introduced more with a stick than a carrot.  The reason for that is the lack of interaction between the different bodies prior to the introduction of the legislation.  We are striving to change that.  When we go out to wear the Irish jersey, even though we wear our parish jerseys, we need to go out with a knowledge of what exactly is the country's position on the different issues coming before us.  We are only an advisory body and sometimes in Europe, one can cry very loudly and not be heard.  At least if we are all singing off the one hymn sheet, it will definitely help us in the future.<\/p><p>  Some of the funding we are talking about is grant aided.  It is tedious to get through the funding applications.  They are a bit unwieldy.  I agree that the local authorities and some of the regional authorities are not up to speed with how to apply for them and how to structure them.  Much of it would need a more regional based approach, because there are some large funds out there that we can tap into, now that we are in a different climate at home.  We need to present our cases a lot better in respect of the grant aid that we can draw down from Europe.  If we interact more with Members of these Houses and with our MEPs and get rid of the current disconnect, perhaps the Chairman can drive that from this committee with the new members of the COR after May, because we are going to have change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Councillor John Sheahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392303000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Councillor Sheahan will probably be a Minister by then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300008#G00500","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1392303000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today and for making their presentations.  The conversation is very worthwhile.  Councillor Sheahan and Councillor Hanniffy probably get my e-mails on a weekly basis, if they do not delete them.  I am the spokesperson for the Government on European affairs in the Seanad and I quite regularly deal with things that are happening in Europe and try to release to the media certain things that are coming down the tracks.  I am picking up on words today and those that have been repeated the most are \"disconnect\", \"communication\" and \"lack of understanding\" with Europe.<\/p> <p>That applies at all levels where Europe is concerned.  I agree with Councillor Constance Hanniffy who said there is a lack of understanding and engagement with the European Union and it is a big problem across the board from councillors to Senators, Deputies, MEPs and the media.  The European Union is such a complicated institution that the general public is lost as to what exactly occurs.  Very little recognition is given to Europe for the good things that happen there.  The Chairman mentioned that we were in Brussels and had discussions around the plain packaging of cigarettes which hit the headlines.  There are so many good things that happen that affect people's daily lives that are not highlighted.  Communication across the board is an ongoing problem.<\/p><p> Deputy Dara Calleary asked a question I was going to ask about communication.  Is there a communication channel in place for the Committee of the Regions, councillors or whoever is interested to access legislation coming down the tracks or are councillors in the same position as me in that I have to search for it?  Perhaps there could be some nexus involving Europe.  The one thing that came across in a big way when we were in Europe is that Europe is a very effective communicator, but communication is two-way and has to be picked up by people.<\/p><p> On the question of MEPs, I certainly think there is a willingness on their part to be more engaged.  It was highlighted to us the number of committees they are required to be on, how tied they are timewise and how difficult it is for them.  We can have very little representation on certain issues, for example, on the foreign affairs committee we do not have any representation from any MEP from any political party from Ireland.  This highlights the fact that issues such as agriculture, fisheries and so on are much more important to us.  It was interesting to understand how stretched are the MEPs.  That does not help the communications issue either between MEPs and ourselves and between MEPs and themselves.  <\/p><p> On the point about the green jersey which everybody repeats and which Deputy Bernard Durkan mentioned, Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly gave a very interesting example of how the green jersey was worn over there on a fisheries issue and how he just happened to meet Mr. Pat the Cope Gallagher.  This goes back to the 1980s when we got extra fishing rights to make up for the fact that we did not have as many as we had previously.  I will not bore the committee with the detail of it but the basic point was Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly and Mr. Pat the Cope Gallagher happened to meet each other and he happened to be going in to vote, and it meant he was able to ask a few of the EPP members around him to vote for it, saying it would not affect them but would help Ireland.  That is an illustration of how the MEPs need to communicate with one another but, in practice, it is difficult because these people are busy living in Europe trying to get to everything they have to attend.  They mentioned that there is room for them to meet up among themselves.  <\/p><p> The last issue was the forum idea suggested by the witnesses.  I had suggested such a forum for MEPs generally on a regional basis, perhaps twice a year, where they would have an opportunity to communicate what they are doing in Europe and to get feedback from the public, councillors or whoever.  Certainly, I would be interested in a forum such as that suggested by Councillor Paul O'Donoghue.  I thank the witnesses and hopefully we will meet soon again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300008#G00600","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392303600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  It is my pleasure to speak to the experts.  Senator Catherine Noone and I have just returned from a familiarisation visit to the European Union, the Parliament and the Commission.  It is rather complicated so the witnesses will excuse me if I get the dot on the wrong \"i\"; they are the experts, having been there for five years ploughing their furrow.  It is important, given the overall political context, that the European Union, national parliaments and local government know there is great concern at the participation by the citizenry of all 28 member states in the process.  We are here speaking about how we can relate to one another with the MEPs, this committee and the Committee of the Regions.  I do not underestimate the difficulty in creating a structure that has us all speaking together.  It will not be easy.  I am a relatively new member of this committee.  Earlier, this committee had tried to facilitate the MEPs and had chosen a Thursday for them but, as the witnesses will see, they are not very visible.<\/p><p>  Whatever about our political affiliations, the key issue is that we have to try to encourage the electorate to participate in a more open way with the Committee of the Regions, Brussels parliamentarians, Government and MEPs because of the threat and fear that as a result of the economic crisis that has affected us, people will become more alienated and this will lead to the potential withdrawing of engagement with the magnificent programme of the European Union.  <\/p><p>  I am still a bit mystified because everybody keeps asking if we are all wearing the green jersey.  The witnesses are affiliated to political groupings and it has been said, rightly, that if one is in the Socialist group or the Christian Democratic group, one affiliates to them.  It is hard to figure this out, but we have some MEPs from Dublin who do not believe in the Union.  Irrespective of our political affiliation, it has to be admitted that we did a great job in the Presidency and we have achieved much in the international arena in terms of our status and role as a small nation, especially after the troika pulling out of the bailout and other aspects of our development programme and the Irish Aid programme.  We are highly respected as a small programme.  What do the witnesses think of the suggestion regarding the forum?  I hope the Chairman can develop a new structure with the witnesses because we all have to talk to one another.  It is a rather complex field and the witnesses are the specialists.  We have only just learned about the structures and we are happy to move forward.

I apologise for my late attendance as I was speaking in the House and missed the opening presentations.  I heard Councillor Paul O'Donoghue's presentation and welcome his comments and proposals on behalf of the committee and acknowledge the Chairman's support for them.  Clearly, in the new pre-enactment stage of legislation there is a greater possibility of a role for the Committee of the Regions.  I am not sure if it has been in contact with the European Commission representatives, the liaison people on the committees, who have a role in bringing forward EU legislation to the committees and are also involved in the pre-enactment stages of our own legislation.  Perhaps there could be greater liaison with the clerks of the various committees.<\/p> <p> I thank the delegates for their submission and I note their concern about the United Kingdom, which I am sure is coming from the representatives from the Border counties.  The delegates share a concern regarding the referendum on EU membership, if there is to be a referendum in 2017, and continuity of EU membership.  I know we all share that same concern.  This year a referendum will be held to determine if Scotland will vote for its independence.  Perhaps that will play a part in the debate because that will be an issue in the debate on whether the United Kingdom is to remain in the European Union,and will come to the fore in the coming year.  I know our Minister has made proposals and has made a speech in the United Kingdom recently.  Clearly it will not convince the people in the United Kingdom to vote \"Yes\" to remaining in the EU for the sake of Ireland but for their own sake.  The importance of the European Union must be highlighted.<\/p><p> Improving the public understanding of the European Union was one of the recommendations in the submission.  It was suggested that local authorities could be better used to demonstrate the benefits of EU membership.  I certainly agree with that because as others have said there is a total disconnect between membership of the EU and the benefits we derive from membership.  We all hear the negatives such as the requirement to comply with EU regulations, such as the habitats directive, waste water legislation and regulations on septic tanks.  Although the EU directives have been in place for a long time, the issues arising are coming to the fore.  We hear speakers at public meetings giving out about the European Union without acknowledging the benefits and positives over a long number of years.<\/p><p> The fundamental principle of the Committee of the Regions is that members are elected by citizens.  Is the disconnect between voters and politics, in particular in the European Union, a matter that can be repaired?  Can we make everybody understand the benefits that come from our membership of the European Union?  As a member of a local authority until 2011, I am sure the witness recognises the issues I have highlighted, such as the negative reaction to some legislation.  Does he come across that attitude on the ground?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300009#H01200","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392304200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  I too was speaking in the D&aacute;il and as a result missed the presentations.  I have read the original submission and have a sense of the content.  I welcome warmly the delegation, individually and collectively.  I spent more than 20 very happy years as an elected member in local government and know a number of the delegates individually.  I would not only know some individuals but would have an acute awareness of their perspective and the degree to which they could bridge the democratic deficit in local government and how relevant local government is to Europe.  I had the privilege of being elected by local authority members to the Seanad on two occasions.  I wish to acknowledge that it was a very productive and mutually satisfactory relationship.<\/p><p>  The principle of subsidiarity is crucial and makes sense.  We are not sufficiently adhering to that principle at European level.  I did not hear Councillor Paul O'Donoghue's initial presentation but I understand from other contributions that he proposed the idea of a forum at regional level, feeding the local opinion to the MEPs who can then feed it upward to the decision-making processes in Europe, thus bringing to people an awareness of how the Commission was arriving at decisions.  I think it is a wonderful concept.  My oldest son was involved with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, the youth organisation, last year.  Representatives from Comhairle na n&Oacute;g attended the youth forums, an initiative of President Higgins, following his election.  The forums were held around the country and were extraordinary successful.  The forum in my area was held in Monaghan and all the young people went to the venue to make an input on what was important, and a large delegation went to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in to make a presentation which was televised live.  This was impressive and was empowering and encouraging for young people.<\/p><p>  Similarly, the principle of a forum can be used in the context of the European Union and I would support that concept.  Under the reform of local government, I think local government will be involved, albeit tentatively initially, with setting the rate of the property tax and collecting the taxes locally.  To be truthful, no matter how much we engage in grandiose talk on the reform of local government, until local politicians are making decisions on taxation, collecting taxes and being accountable for the moneys collected and implementing policy decisions on spending that money one will not have effective local government reform.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, has included in his proposals a proposition to give local authority members discretion to adjust the property tax.  While the level of discretion is inadequate, it is a starting position and I hope it will develop further.<\/p><p>  The move to involve local government in the role of job creation and link local authorities to the new local enterprise boards is a very good principle.  It is important to give local government an economic function.  If local government becomes involved in the collection of taxation, as well as its social and democratic remits, then it can confidently have an input into Europe and can demand a role in this regard.  It wold be bizarre of the leadership in Europe if it did not want to tap into a system of local government that was responsible for setting and collecting taxes and accountable for all moneys as well as job creation strategies.  I support much greater engagement of local government with Europe, which will mean that structures of local authorities must improve.<\/p><p>  My colleagues Deputy Eric Byrne and Senator Catherine Noone went to Europe to be briefed on issues such as the democratic deficit and the disconnect with the public.  What can be expected but a democratic deficit and such a disconnect if one does not have an input from the local government representatives directly inputting to European policy.  It is nonsense if one does not have that connection.<\/p><p>  The point made about the United Kingdom has very serious implications for the people I represent in the Cavan-Monaghan Border constituency.  There are many implications for the Border areas if the United Kingdom is outside the European Union.  It would have a serious impact on trade as the United Kingdom, our neighbour, is our largest trading partner and we do 57% of our trade with it.  It was correct to highlight the importance of trying to encourage the United Kingdom to stay within the European Union.  May I suggest that one way to do that is to implement subsidiarity, the very idea that the delegation wants implemented at European level?  If there were proper structures to connect local government to Europe that might well encourage the United Kingdom to vote against leaving the Union.  It behoves all members elected to local government, the Oireachtas and the European Parliament to do everything through personal contact with UK members, be they of local government, Parliament or the European Parliament, to encourage them to remain in the European Union.<\/p> <p>We have a duty to create conditions in the EU whereby the UK does not feel that it should secede from the EU.  We have a particular responsibility in that regard.<\/p><p> I do not think anyone will take exception, and I know that the Chair will indulge me, if I make a personal comment.  I welcome everyone here.  I am delighted that all of the members of the delegation are present and I know many of them individually.  They are all welcome and I know them to be excellent people.  I hope that nobody will take exception if I briefly extend good wishes to one of the members of the delegation who will retire from local government.  Her retirement will be a great loss to the organisation and local government in this country.  She has been a pioneering representative and one of our best players.

Within our own political groups there are differences of opinion on what is the best thing to happen -  whether to stay in or stay out.  There is even a huge difference of opinions between the British delegations.  I have found that other members have leaned towards the Irish and asked us what the British will do and whether they are playing games.

I shall briefly deal with some of the issues raised.<br \/>Senator Noone asked whether we received advance notice of issues which gets to the kernel of the point that we have tried to make.  Every October or November the Commission lays out its legislative programme comprising between 40 and 50 directives that it wishes to introduce.  It is our considered view that after the announcement each year the forum we have proposed should meet and decide on an Irish strategy and the way that Ireland should deal with the issues as they arise and as the year goes on.  <br \/>I know that a Deputy suggested that it could be just local and regional strategy.  We hope that it would comprise MEPs, the economic and social policy commission, Committee of the Regions or all of us together in order to produce a common strategy.  That is important.  As someone inquired earlier, in Brussels does one hand know what the other hand is doing?  The honest answer is &quot;No&quot;.  We depend on <i>ad hoc<\/i>meetings with MEPs to make a decision on positions but that is not the best way going forward.  That explains our position on the introduction of the forum.<br \/>A question on political groups was raised.  We all have a certain loyalty to our political groups and that is the political reality.  However, we have adopted the following position.  If an issue is of core importance to Ireland then the political group position is secondary to the position of our country.  That is the view that we take.  We could all work far better together, as a group and collectively, if we met a few times a year to study the programme.  That is all we suggest.  It is nothing grandiose, nothing that will cost a lot of money or anything of that nature and is not a talking shop.  We suggest we meet to discuss and agree a strategy.  <br \/>Let me give an example of an opinion that I worked on recently which concerned the marine spatial strategy and integrated coastal management.  Most politicians in Ireland and other people had not even heard what was meant by the strategy.  The Commission proposed that it would be responsible for the planning of our coastal regions in all of Europe.  Such a proposal would have huge implications.  As we know, some EU directives have not been well received by Ireland.  Were it not for the Oireachtas supplying a paper, by way of the warning system, stating where Ireland stood on the subject, I would have no idea where our country was coming from.

Recently I worked on an opinion on the Atlantic strategy and the Taoiseach brought it through the Council when Ireland held the Presidency in May of last year.  The Atlantic strategy could provide huge economic benefits for the country.  How many local or regional authorities in Ireland have an idea that the strategy was passed, that it will provide funding from the year 2014 on to 2020, that it has priorities and that we should feed into them?  An information gap does exist and other countries are well ahead of Ireland in terms of securing funding.<\/p><p>  Most counties here have - believe it or not - a European officer but it is hard to know about him or her.

It is becoming very clear that we are all on the one page.  Many of us have the same interests and we have all identified the same challenges.  We met the Minister approximately a year ago and talked about funding.  Much of the structural funding is becoming competitive.  It not like a few years ago where there was a cake and it is was divided up among every country.<\/p><p>  There are great opportunities now because in Ireland, as in Europe, all our universities and institutes of technology are growing campuses around them, which are doing research, are engaged in job creation and so on.  They are in a prime position, with the support of local authorities and county development boards, to pitch for this.  <\/p><p>  My local authority is probably more advanced than others because we have experience over the years with PEACE, the International Fund for Ireland, INTERREG and so on.  We have devised a fairly good model but it needs to be developed.  We would like to keep it to ourselves and not give out many of our secrets but this must developed in Cork, Dublin, Galway and elsewhere.  Some are at an advanced stage.<\/p><p>  There is money that can be drawn down but we need to move very fast to get it.  It is not a case of the local authorities taking all the money for themselves for roads or other infrastructure but it is to develop education, research, jobs and tourism.  The money is available but we must go after it.  <\/p><p>  We spoke earlier about the relationships between the different committees.  We meet before every plenary and discuss all the issues.  We meet Mr. Robert Collins from our secretariat and go through all the issues in advance and discuss our own opinions.  All of us know what the others' issues are or the other issues with which we are involved.  During the plenary we meet the permanent representatives and the ambassadors and discuss the issues with which we are dealing during the plenary, but we also ask them to give us information on future issues, especially where they pertain to Ireland.  <\/p><p>  We referred to relationships with other countries in Europe.  The UK, for example, is to bring in a tax in regard to foreign lorries which will have a major impact.  Many of the transport companies in County Donegal and in other counties will relocate across the Border where they will pay half the road tax.  They have come forward with ideas, such as lowering the road tax here and charging foreign lorries the same as in the UK where they pay as they go.  Many issues affect the Border region.  We have a special relationship with the UK and Northern Ireland, which affects the economy.  Many of these issues could be discussed.  For me, it is a win-win situation.  If this committee could lead on this forum, everything could be tabled and we could work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300012#L00600","nonspeaker":"Councillor Patrick McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392305400,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I thank Councillor McGowan and call Councillor Fiona O'Loughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014021300012#L00700","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392305400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

On any study visits in which we have been lucky enough to participate it has always been linked in, especially with regard to research ideas.  Our Commissioner is in that area and we could learn valuable lessons in that regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne raised support issues and how we fare in a situation in which many of our European colleagues have very well-resourced offices.

Members will be aware that I have agreed, subject to scheduling arrangements, to attend the committee on a quarterly basis to update them and discuss developments at ECOFIN.  In addition, my officials provide a written briefing on a monthly basis.  This is a very useful and positive development and I look forward to this morning's engagement.  Greece took over the Presidency in January and next week&rsquo;s meeting will be the second of its Presidency.  I understand the committee has already received the draft agenda and background material for the February meeting.   A number of key issues are listed for discussion and it is hoped significant progress will be made at the meeting.<\/p><p>  As the committee also asked if I would also provide a brief overview of proceedings at the January meeting, I will turn to that issue.  The aforementioned meeting took place in Brussels on 28 January and the agenda was relatively light, which was to be expected.  Generally, the first meeting under any Presidency is light because the previous Presidency would have made a big push to finish off items at the end of its term.  As is customary at the beginning of a new Presidency term, the Greek Presidency presented its work programme on economic and financial matters.  The Council took note of the Presidency's work programme and its key objectives of supporting economic growth and employment and restoring confidence in the financial sector.  The Greek Presidency has set out a busy schedule for its six month term and I expect that in the early months it will focus on the files where it might be possible to reach agreement with the European Parliament before the Parliament&rsquo;s term ends.  The Greek Presidency is the final leg of our Presidency trio.  It has chosen &ldquo;Europe: our common quest&rdquo; as its theme and I wish it all the very best in its term in office.<\/p><p>  At the ECOFIN meeting in January there was also an update by the European Central Bank on the implementation of the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, for banks.  The regulations establishing the SSM were adopted in October 2013 and it is scheduled to come into operation in November 2014.  The SSM will cover the euro area, as well as non-eurozone member states that choose to participate.  The ECB will have direct oversight of banks in these countries and work in close co-operation with national supervisory authorities.  In preparation for taking over this task the ECB, in co-ordination with the European Banking Authority, will conduct an asset quality review and stress tests as part of its comprehensive assessment of the banks over which it will have direct oversight.  <\/p><p>  The January ECOFIN meeting also followed up on December&rsquo;s European Council meeting and focused on implementation of the Compact for Growth and Jobs.  The Compact for Growth and Jobs was agreed in June 2012 with the aim of boosting economic growth, investment and employment, as well as making Europe more competitive.  While progress has been made in this area, efforts are ongoing to ensure it is fully exploited.  With this mind, at the January ECOFIN meeting the European Commission and the European Investment Bank updated the Council on initiatives to restore normal lending to the economy.   <\/p><p>  In January the Council also adopted a decision regarding the existence of an excessive government deficit in Croatia and issued a recommendation to correct the deficit by 2016.  That morning, as usual, Ministers held a breakfast meeting to review the economic situation.  There was also an update on the state of play in the negotiations on an intergovernmental agreement on the single resolution fund for banks. <\/p><p>  I will now turn to next Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting.  Members will see that there are important items to be discussed.  I propose to outline the key issues likely to arise, after which I will be happy to take questions and observations from members.  I remind them that this is a draft agenda and that there can still be changes between now and the meeting in terms of content and the order of the discussion.  In addition, work is ongoing at the level of officials and there may be more substantial changes in terms of how the discussions will evolve.  The formal ECOFIN meeting is scheduled to commence at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.  Earlier that morning we will have a breakfast meeting during which I expect the Commission Vice President, Mr. Olli Rehn, to comment on the economic situation in Europe, as well as allowing Ministers an opportunity to consider economic matters more broadly.<\/p><p>  According to the draft agenda, the first items to be considered are the legislative deliberations.  These will, as normal, take place in public session.  Based on the draft agenda, two items are scheduled for discussion, namely, savings taxation and the single resolution mechanism, SRM.  The Presidency will also provide us with an update on the ongoing work on financial services dossiers.  However, at this stage, we understand the savings taxation file may be taken off the agenda for next week&rsquo;s meeting.  This issue relates to EU rules regarding the tax treatment of interest income.  We expect it will be discussed instead at the March meeting.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of a single resolution fund, I expect the Presidency to inform Ministers about the trilogue process under way with the European Parliament.  The SRM is an essential step in creating the banking union and completing all aspects of banking union is urgent if we want to break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.  This is a priority issue for Ireland.  While there is a divergence of opinion between the Council and the Parliament on issues such as scope, financing and governance, the Presidency will work to progress this issue, with a revised mandate, if necessary.  In that context, Ministers will also have a special meeting in Brussels on Monday evening to discuss the intergovernmental agreement on the single resolution fund.  Last December the Council agreed a general approach on a proposed single resolution board and a single fund for the resolution of banks.  The compromise agreement consisted of a draft regulation on the SRM and a decision by the euro area member states committing them to negotiate by 1 March 2014 an intergovernmental agreement on the functioning of the single resolution fund.  The intergovernmental agreement will facilitate the gradual mutualisation of the fund over a ten year period.  Officials have been meeting to discuss these issues and I expect Ministers to be updated on these discussions.  I also expect an effort to be made to make progress and resolve the outstanding issues at a political level.  This is an important dossier and one we wish to progress to a satisfactory and timely outcome.<\/p> <p> I refer to non-legislative activities.  There are two related important items under the annual semester process - the annual growth survey and the alert mechanism report, AMR.  The semester process allows for stronger economic governance and co-ordination at EU level.  This is the fourth year that the process has been in operation but it is the first that Ireland will be fully integrated into the process, as we have now exited the EU-IMF programme.  On an annual basis the EU semester begins with the publication by the Commission of its annual growth survey which member states take on board in their budgetary and economic plans.  The Commission's assessment is that growth is beginning to return and that member states are making progress.  The Commission has targeted the same five key priorities as published in last year&rsquo;s survey: pursuing growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis; and modernising public administration.   <\/p><p> The annual growth survey will feed into national economic and budgetary decisions and be reflected in our stability programme update and national reform programme, which all member states produce in April.  The Commission then assesses the plans of member states and makes a series of country specific recommendations, CSRs, to each member state.  The draft Council conclusions under consideration at this ECOFIN meeting have been prepared by officials.  The conclusions endorse the findings of the annual growth survey and provide macroeconomic and fiscal guidance for member states.<\/p><p> The alert mechanism report, AMR, is also part of the annual semester process.  The Commission checks member states&rsquo; performance through the AMR against a scoreboard of economic indicators to determine which require further investigation through an in-depth review.  Draft ECOFIN conclusions on the AMR have been prepared at official level.  At the time of drafting the report in November 2013 Ireland was still in the EU-IMF programme and, therefore, not included in the list of countries proposed for an in-depth review.  However, now that Ireland has exited the programme, the conclusions consider that it should be integrated into the semester framework and propose that the Commission consider preparing such a review.  A long discussion is not expected at ECOFIN on this item.  This process will unfold in the coming months and Ireland will play a full part in the governance and semester process this year.<\/p><p> There will also be an exchange of views on preparations for the G20 meeting of finance Ministers and governors in Sydney later this month.  The purpose of this discussion will be to endorse the EU terms of reference for the meeting which has been prepared by officials.<\/p><p> The final two items on the agenda are annual items related to the EU budget.  One item is a \"backwards\" looking item and the other looks \"forward\".  First up is the discharge procedure in respect of the implementation of the budget for 2012.  \"Discharge\" is the technical term under the EU treaty given to the approval procedure for the implementation of the EU budget.  At the meeting Ministers will be asked to agree to a Council recommendation which will then be forwarded to the European Parliament to grant discharge to the Commission for the manner in which funds were managed in 2012.  In other words, it is the sign-off on the 2012 European budget.<\/p><p> The other EU budget item relates to the budget guidelines for 2015.  This is also an annual item.  The Council agrees a set of guiding principles for the Commission to take into account when preparing its draft proposal for next year's EU budget.<\/p><p> Under the heading of any other business the ECB will provide its first quarterly report on implementation of the SSM to which I referred.<\/p><p> We will cover a range of issues at the meeting, particularly related to banking matters and the EU semester process.  These are important areas of interest to all citizens of Europe.  It is important that we get it right and we will work with the Greek Presidency and our colleagues from other member states to ensure progress is made.  I thank members for their attention and will be happy to respond to questions or observations they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021300003#B00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392284400,"counter":680,"content":"<p>As we need to conclude the meeting by 11 a.m., we will have eight minute slots.<\/p><p>  Has there been any indication of what the CSRs will be for Ireland?

First, we have the growth forecast which is the starting point, from which we will move on and incorporate the data in our budgetary forecast and plans for the next three years or so.  The big change for Ireland is that while we were in a programme, we did not have to participate in this process, but we will be integrated with everybody else for the first time.<\/p><p>  It is expected that Ireland will receive CSRs.  It is too early to say, but based on our contacts with the Commission, it appears that issues that were addressed in the EU-IMF programme but not fully resolved will feed into the recommendations.  In addition to taking a country-specific approach when formulating CSRs, the Commission also uses a thematic approach.  Therefore, a number of member states will receive similar recommendations.  All member states receive recommendations on their public finances.  We will, therefore, most likely receive a recommendation to continue on our current path of deficit reduction.  It will be a reaffirmation of the targets we had, for example, reducing the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015.  The follow through from the programme is to continue the structural reform of the economy.  Then there are items pending.  For example, the legislation to reform legal practice is one of the major Bills to be introduced.  A series of amendments were made on Committee Stage of the Bill some time last week.  That issue will be mentioned, but we are on target to fulfil that reform.  The detail of the CSRs is not important but the fact that we will enter the mainstream.  I do not know whether Ireland will be subject to a country-specific review.

Based on his opening remarks and the agenda for the ECOFIN Council, the February meeting, like the meeting in January, will be dominated by aspects of banking union and the EU semester process.  I am most interested in how all of this affects Ireland and the issues that are of importance here.  The SSM is due to become operational in November this year.  Is there an agreed division of duties between the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland, as an agent of the ECB, in the context of the day-to-day supervision and regulation of the banks that come under the SSM?  Will this be formalised in a memorandum of understanding between the ECB and the Central Bank?  How will it work?  Will the changed role of the Central Bank have implications for its headcount?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021300004#C00400","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1392284400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>The bank in Frankfurt is the overriding and superior authority and the Central Bank will act as an agent of the ECB, but some of the supervision will be undertaken directly by the new regulatory office that will operate out of Frankfurt.<\/p> <p>I have a further note which may be helpful to the Deputy.  The ECB will be the direct supervisor of banks with assets of more than &euro;30 billion or assets to national GDP ratio of 20%.  To ensure the SSM is truly the European level supervisor it will involve banks in all member states covering at least the three most significant banks in each participating member state, which effectively is Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and PTSB in our case.  Ireland's credit unions will be exempt from regulation by the supervisory authority.<\/p><p> The method of how it works is as follows.  The European Central Bank will be responsible for the single supervisory mechanism and will begin to supervise all major or systemically important banks in the eurozone and in those countries that choose to join the mechanism.  The ECB, as common supervisor, will take over responsibility for these banks from the national central banks from November 2014.  National central banks will continue to play an important role, but the ECB will have the ultimate responsibility for the system.  The system provides for a differentiated approach to supervision depending on the size and significance of the banks.  It provides for the equal treatment for euro area and non-euro area member states to allow banking union to be attractive to all 28 member states thereby protecting the Single Market.  Smaller institutions will not come under the direct supervision of the ECB but the ECB will remain responsible and can step in to supervise these institutions.<\/p><p> The agreement provides that in most cases the newly created supervisory board within the ECB votes on a one-member-one-vote principle.  This will ensure the correct balance in decision making between larger and smaller members states.  The system also ensures that monetary policy remains separate from supervisory policy, something that was important to Germany.<\/p><p> The Central Bank is independent in how it operates and I can read another note on it.  At the meeting under any other business we will discuss implementation of the single supervisory mechanism.  The SSM regulation requires the ECB to send a quarterly progress report to the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission from 3 November 2013.  The purpose of this report is to provide these institutions with an update on the progress in operational implementation of the SSM.  The first of these reports covering the period from 3 November 2013 to February 2014 issued recently.  I expect this report will form the basis of our discussion on this matter at ECOFIN.<\/p><p> I was asked about issues the ECB highlighted in the first quarterly report.  The briefing answer is as follows.  The report, which is required under the SSM regulation, not only covers the three months up to 3 February 2014, but also the preparatory work undertaken by the ECB in close co-operation with national supervisors and the central banks since the euro area summit of 29 June 2012.  The transitory structure set up by the ECB to prepare for the start of the single supervisory mechanism has already made significant progress thereby enabling a smooth entry into force of the SSM regulation on 3 November 2013.  The supervisory model of the SSM has largely been developed as reflected in the draft supervisory manual of the SSM, which covers all the tasks and supervisory processes of the SSM, including the relations between the ECB and the national competent authorities.  The key concept of the supervisory manual is that joint supervision teams will directly supervise the approximately 130 banks considered significant in accordance with the SSM regulation.

The issue for it is that it wants to be sure of what it is taking over in terms of institutions it will regulate.

From our point of view there is an advantage in it because the date of the last quality review was June 2013.  The asset quality review the ECB will carry out will be aligned with the rest of Europe, which is the last day of December 2013.  It is an asset quality review six months later and the Deputy will recall that property prices particularly in Dublin have increased quite substantially in that part of the year.<\/p><p>  The Deputy knows how the stress test works.  There is a normal line and a stress line, and assumptions are made about the stress.  One of the assumptions made previously was to consider what would happen if property prices reduced by, maybe, 20%.  That is how it is measured under stress and the risks are built in.  It would be unreasonable to make an assumption now that property prices would reduce by significant amounts; if anything they are going in the opposite direction.<\/p><p>  As the value of the collateral that underpins the loan book is increasing, we should get a better result.  However, it is not possible to predict the result with accuracy because if it was we would not need a stress test at all.

This is the purpose of the resolution policy.  The essential difference for the taxpayer is that, instead of insolvent financial institutions being bailed out by the taxpayers, which is what happened in Ireland and elsewhere, they will be bailed in by accessing in the first instance their assets.  The shareholders go first and have their assets bailed in, then subordinate bondholders, then senior bondholders and then corporate deposits.  There is a guarantee that personal deposits of up to &euro;100,000 are sacrosanct.  There is a bail in process involving participants in the bank, either at shareholder level or lender level, and the taxpayer is not approached.  This separates the banks from the sovereign.<\/p><p>  If there are still losses in the bank after the bailing in, a backstop is necessary to provide additional funds.<\/p> <p>The resolution fund can then be accessed.  As that becomes mutualised, there will be a significant fund available to resolve the banks.  Also, as a fund of &euro;55 billion to &euro;60 billion is insufficient for a banking system that has more than &euro;30 trillion on its balance sheets, it can be leveraged up and borrowed against.  During the initial phases of the process the different sovereign components can borrow from each other, thereby assisting the sovereign that requires additional resources.  As a further backstop there is the ESM funding.  That is the big difference.  It is a movement from bailouts by taxpayers of insolvent banks to a bail in of the assets of the bank to resolve the bank and put it on a new footing.  That is the principle difference.  <\/p><p> It is hard to envisage some of these things before they happen.  In the United States, there has been a common currency for years, the dollar, and a common banking system.  It has been the case for a couple of hundred years that if a bank went bust in Texas it was not the responsibility of only the Texan authorities rather, they bailed in the assets and the Fed went in and assisted with it.  What happened in Ireland with Anglo Irish Bank and the other banks would never have happened in the United States.  The banking system there would have had to take the hit.  This dates back to around 1790 in the US but is only now developing in Europe.  We have moved from having a common currency with a defective architecture underpinning it in times of distress to a currency union supported by a fiscal union with the six pack, two pack, European semester and all the other systems mentioned by the Deputy, which is also underpinned by a banking union.  What we are witnessing now is all of the elements of a functioning common currency area being put in place.  The nearest analogous situation is the United States even though the mechanisms are different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021300007#F00800","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392286800,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1392286800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>That the taxpayer should not be saddled with the speculative gambling debts of private institutions goes without saying.

There is a misunderstanding about what is happening.  An independent liquidator has been put in place under law.  Specific legislation in this regard was put through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  His responsibility is to get the best deal possible for the taxpayer and value for money.  What is on the market are the mortgage books of former Irish Nationwide, which were transferred into IBRC.  There is a great deal of misunderstanding about this.  The holder of a performing mortgage who has met each monthly payment of the mortgage for the past 15 years and now owes only &euro;50,000 might well ask for a discount.  However, a performing mortgage does not get discounted because the value of it is par.  Only impaired mortgages are discounted.  It is like the bag of apples, some of which are good and others of which are not so good.  The value for the purchaser is not in the performing mortgages but in the impaired mortgages because by definition the value of a performing mortgage is par.  Basically, the profit to be made by anybody who purchases is on the better management of the accounts.<\/p><p>  Deputy Higgins asked how the individual mortgage holder will be affected.  First, their mortgages are held under contract and there will be no change in the contractual position regardless of who purchases them.  It is the additional protocols put in place by the Central Bank in regard to how a person with an impaired mortgage could be approached and treated by the banks that will not apply if a purchase is outside of the Irish regulatory system.  We have had two examples of this already because this is not the first mortgage book that has been sold.  Two tranches of mortgages have been already purchased.  In both cases, the purchasers who were outside of the Irish regulatory system voluntarily agreed to apply all the protocols.  Any legal adviser would tell them that is what they should do because in the exceptional number of cases that have gone before the court for repossession the first question asked by the judge was if all of the obligations that are supposed to be fulfilled under the Central Bank protocols have been.  If a lending agency has not done so the court will not give an order to proceed with a repossession.  I am fully aware of what the Deputy is saying.  However, we are going to wait to see who buys the mortgage book, following which we will do as we did in the other two cases.  My officials have already had discussions on this with the Central Bank.  The purchaser will be told of the protocols applicable in Ireland which we expect him or her to fulfil, advising that it is in their own interest to do so.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath will shortly publish a Bill to enshrine this in law.  If at the end of the day legislation is required we will look at whether that Bill would fulfil the objectives.  It is my objective too that when the mortgage books are sold the mortgage holders will have the same level of protection as they currently have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021300008#G00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1392286800,"counter":730,"content":"<p>There is no point in hoping for the good will of vulture capitalists who roam the world picking up what they can.

The only feasible way of addressing multinationals is on a multinational basis, and no one small country can remediate an international practice.  The Deputy would agree with that as well.  This is why the G20 has asked the OECD to bring forward recommendations on how the international community can move on a reform agenda on corporate tax.  As that is happening, I expect the OECD to publish recommendations during the summer, with a view to them being discussed by the G20 in September or October.  That is the timeline, although there is significant movement.<br \/>In the meantime I do not want Ireland to be beaten up with false information, because we are not a tax haven and we are totally transparent.  The likes of Google has 3,000 people in the docklands working, and they are not a fiction for tax purposes.  The problem with the work produced by the professor in Trinity College is that he has taken American data and included all companies incorporated in Ireland, even if they have not a presence here.  As he includes those factors, he has formulated the 2% figure, which is incorrect.  Taking the companies that have established in Ireland and make profits here, one would get a much higher figure.  There is a very clear and transparent system but we took some reputational damage because of misinformation.<br \/>In the last Finance Bill I dealt with the issue of companies incorporated in Ireland which are not liable for tax anywhere.  With the international movement emanating from OECD recommendations, most countries will have to make a similar move, although we are not yet sure where that will be.  The most recent publication on the matter is a statement by Commissioner Almunia, who is responsible for state aid matters.  He is reported in the business pages of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning with quite a long statement.

Carroll to discuss the Government&rsquo;s proposal on plain packaging.  My name is Steven Donaldson and I am the general manager of P.J. Carroll and Company Limited.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ronald Ridderbeekx, head of corporate affairs for British American Tobacco in the UK and Ireland.<\/p><p>  Founded in 1824, P.J. Carroll is proud to be one of Ireland&rsquo;s oldest and best known businesses.  Now a member of the BAT group, we currently employ 30 people, support the pensions of hundreds of former employees and indirectly support thousands of jobs across Ireland.<\/p><p>  At the outset, let me say that we fully accept that smoking causes serious and fatal diseases.  Therefore, we fully recognise and accept the Government&rsquo;s right and interest in regulating on smoking and health issues.  I also want to state unequivocally that in no way do we market our products to children.  We fully support Government efforts to tackle youth smoking and we work in partnership with others to achieve this.  We do not seek to turn non-smokers into smokers.  There are 970,000 adult smokers in Ireland and more than 100,000 of them switch brands each year.  Our business consists of offering quality tobacco products to these well-informed adults who make the choice to smoke.  We fully accept that there is a long-term declining trend in the number of smokers and in the amount that these smokers consume.<\/p><p>  It is our view that the legislation on plain packaging, under consideration by the committee, is a disproportionate measure.  It will not achieve its stated aims but will risk a number of important undesirable consequences.  I will address the following four points.  First, the proposal will not reduce smoking rates or stop children from taking up smoking.  In fact, evidence from Australia indicates there has been no change in rates of smoking even though plain packs have been on the market for 15 months.  Second, the proposal will only benefit the criminal black market by providing a boost to an already thriving illicit trade in Ireland.  Third, by depriving P.J. Carroll of our legitimately held trademarks - enshrined in Ireland&rsquo;s Constitution and protected by EU and international law - plain packaging will damage Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a positive environment for business.  It will give other industries cause for concern that their trademarks are not safe in Ireland.  Finally, and crucially, there is a better way to achieve the Government's public health objectives.  Proven measures such as a stronger focus on education, enforcement of existing laws and a ban on proxy purchasing can and will deliver results.<\/p> <p>There is no credible evidence to suggest that plain packaging will reduce smoking rates.  Extensive research has been carried out into why people take up smoking.  All of the research points to parental influence, peer influence, social and cultural norms, price and access as the key factors, not packaging.  Evidence offered by lobbyists for plain packaging points to a range of studies on attitudes and intentions to support their claims but fails to point to any real world evidence on the effect on smoking behaviour.  Studies referenced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, deal only with how people intend to react to the idea of plain packs, not what they actually do as a result of plain packs in the real world.  Studies have shown that uglier packs are less attractive but they have failed to make the critical connection between uglier packs and the decision to take up smoking.  The evidence offered in favour of plain packs is analysed in detail in our submission, which I encourage committee members to consider if they have not already done so.<\/p><p> Australia is the only country in the world to introduce plain packaging, in late 2012.  The evidence from Australia has demonstrated that the desired outcome of a reduction in smoking prevalence has not been achieved.  The evidence available from Australia, in reports from independent researchers KPMG and London Economics, shows that smoking rates in Australia have remained on trend, a small annual decline.  In fact, the consumption of smoking is declining at a slightly slower rate than in the previous ten years, which is not what was predicted.  Since plain packs were introduced in Australia 15 months ago, there has been absolutely no impact on smoking rates.<\/p><p> I will turn to the issue of smuggling.  Plain packaging will create a big opportunity for criminals; they will only have to produce one pack design ever again if they so choose.  By making it harder for consumers to distinguish between brands, price will become a more important factor in Ireland.  More people will turn to the cheapest available cigarettes and these will be found on the black market.  Estimates of the size, and cost to the Exchequer, of the Irish black market in tobacco vary but are between &euro;240 million and double that amount.  Either way, it is substantial.  To put this in perspective, criminals already sell twice as many cigarettes in Ireland as P.J. Carroll but none of the criminal gangs behind the tobacco black market will appear before an Oireachtas committee.  They do not obey any tobacco control regulations, they do not pay tax, they do not ask for ID and they do not care what is in the cigarettes they sell.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, recently told the D&aacute;il: &ldquo;As we continue to use price to discourage people from smoking, I think we will divert more and more of the trade to the illicit trade.&rdquo;  The Minister is correct, and it will be compounded by a measure that creates a lack of differentiation between a legal, duty paid pack of 20 for sale at &euro;9.50 and a smuggled pack at half the price.<\/p><p> We fully acknowledge and support the valuable work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners in their efforts to tackle the black market.  While acknowledging their contribution to the committee, it is worth noting that they indicated they have not yet seen any evidence from Australia on the impact of plain packaging on the black market.  However, the most recent KPMG report points to a 13% increase in the level of tobacco smuggling in Australia in the first six months after it was introduced.  The market has shifted, with new illegal plain pack lookalike brands and what are known as illicit whites gaining market share rapidly.  If the trend is replicated in Ireland, we will see large growth in smuggled tobacco.  This will undermine the interests of honest retailers, the law-abiding and tax compliant tobacco industry, Government excise returns and public health objectives.  The black market in cigarettes already costs the state hundreds of millions of euro and provides children with access to cigarettes.  Plain packaging, while well intentioned, will only make this worse.<\/p><p> I would like to briefly touch on intellectual property issues.  Our trademarks identify the origin and quality of our products.  They tell the consumer that what is on the pack is what is in the pack.  The removal of the legitimately held intellectual property rights of P.J. Carroll and other companies is a disproportionate measure in light of the less trade restrictive alternatives available.  We also believe it is in breach of Irish and European law and international trade law.  It will seriously damage Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a good destination for business, as evidenced by the concerns expressed by many business organisations to this committee.  A number of countries are currently challenging Australian plain packaging legislation at the World Trade Organization.  It is one of the biggest disputes ever to appear before the WTO, with 35 parties, including the EU and therefore Ireland, involved.  We encourage this committee not to consider the introduction of any such legislation until the outcome of this dispute is known.  Otherwise, it is possible that plain packaging legislation will need to be repealed.<\/p><p> Let me be clear that there is a better way.  There is no disagreement between P.J. Carroll, the Government or the committee.  We have a shared objective of preventing children from taking up smoking.  We support proportionate and evidence-based measures to achieve this objective - measures which will not result in the undesirable consequences I have already outlined.  First, we do not believe that any adult should be able to purchase tobacco for children.  We believe that any adult who does so is knowingly breaking the law and there must be effective criminal penalties for these adults.  Second, certain education programmes have proven particularly successful at stopping children from starting to smoke.  These education programmes focus not just on the awareness of risks of smoking, but also provide young people with the life skills to resist peer pressure and make their own choices.  Germany, Sweden, and some states in America have achieved excellent outcomes by using education to address youth initiation.  In Germany, smoking among children 12 to 17 years has seen a significant decline over the past ten years, from 27.5% to 11.7%.  Germany does not ban advertisement or display of products.  Instead, it focuses on education programmes such as Class2000, ClearSight and \"Be smart-don't start\".  Education and preventing access are proven ways to stop children from starting smoking.  They tackle the real drivers of youth initiation &ndash; peer pressure, social and cultural norms and access.  Packaging is not why children or adults start smoking and plain packaging will not make them stop.<\/p><p> Last week, this committee discussed with business groups the need to carry out a regulatory impact assessment, RIA, on the legislation.  The following day, the Department of Health told stakeholders that it was finally going to carry out an RIA.  The Cabinet handbook and Taoiseach&rsquo;s guidelines are clear that an RIA should have been carried out before the Minister brought the proposal to legislate to Cabinet last November.  This committee should not have been asked by the Minister to hear evidence without having an RIA to assess the costs and benefits.<\/p><p> I thank Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  We sincerely urge members to gather more evidence before making recommendations on the proposal.  The committee must consider the outcome of an RIA before making any recommendations to the Minister.  We ask that the committee look further at the evidence from Australia.  The evidence clearly shows that the Australian plain packaging experiment is failing.  We urge the committee to await the outcome of the major dispute at the WTO.<\/p><p> We believe this further evidence will show committee members and Government that this legislation will not achieve its aims but will have serious negative consequences.  These include boosting an already thriving black market that undermines health objectives, costing the taxpayer further millions in lost taxes, costing jobs around the country, illegally confiscating intellectual property and severely damaging Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a result.  I thank members for listening this morning and I look forward to answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steven Donaldson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392289200,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Andrew Meagher, managing director of John Player &amp;amp; Sons Limited, and I invite him to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300003#B00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392289200,"counter":788,"content":"<p>My name is Andrew Meagher and I am the managing director of John Player &amp;amp; Sons Limited.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Axel Gietz, director of group corporate affairs at Imperial Tobacco.  I can assist the committee with issues regarding the Irish market and Dr. Gietz can answer questions on any broader corporate matters.<\/p><p>  John Player &amp;amp; Sons Limited has a long and proud history in Ireland and employs 70 people.  Imperial Tobacco also operates a tobacco factory in Mullingar, which employs 120 people.  We are a legitimate company authorised by the Government and Revenue to sell a lawful regulated product to adults.  We fully support the Minister&rsquo;s objective that children should not smoke.  Nobody working in our company wants children to smoke - neither ours nor anybody else&rsquo;s.  I am grateful for this opportunity to debunk the myth that we use our brands to entice Irish children to smoke.  I have worked for 20 years in John Player &amp;amp; Sons Limited.  Over that time, neither I, nor any of my colleagues, has ever once developed or designed a brand or even contemplated such a thing with the purpose of attracting children to smoke.<\/p><p>  While sharing the Minister&rsquo;s objective, we hold a different view from him as to what is the most effective way to prevent minors from smoking.  The Minister believes plain packaging would prevent children from starting to smoke because they are influenced by cigarette packaging but there is no credible evidence to support this contention, either from Australia or anywhere else.<\/p> <p>Even the Chief Medical Officer, when he met the committee before Christmas, accepted the absence of evidence from Australia.  He said, \"We have to await a proper evaluation\", and I fully agree.<\/p><p> Ireland has followed a high tax, high regulation approach to tobacco control for many years and yet Irish smoking rates remain consistently high.  According to EU statistics, Ireland's 2012 smoking rate of 29% is the same as it was in 2006.  Some 28% of young Irish people start smoking at 15 years and younger compared with the EU average of 17%.  The ban on press advertising, the ban on smoking in pubs, the ban on ten packs, the ban on display of tobacco in shops and significant excise increases have not had any measurable impact on smoking rates.  Ireland's tobacco control model is simply not working.  However, alternative approaches based on education and instruction rather than bans appear to be much more successful.  <\/p><p> The German tobacco control strategy, which is education based, has produced striking results.  It permits billboard and cinema advertising of tobacco.  Tobacco products are openly displayed in German shops and yet youth smoking initiation rates are 17% in Germany compared with 28% in Ireland.  In America, the Centre for Disease Control recommends tobacco use prevention education programmes in schools.<\/p><p> There are three predictable consequences of plain packaging that would negatively affect the entire community.  The black market would grow, the Exchequer, legitimate industry and retailers would lose revenue without any decline in consumption levels as tobacco tourism flourishes, and Ireland's international business reputation would be undermined.  As we sit here today, criminals are busily selling illicit white cigarettes on Moore Street in complete violation of every single tobacco control measure that this country has ever introduced, including selling to children.  The irony is that if this Bill were to be passed, organised crime gangs would have the unique selling point of being the only supplier of branded packs in the country and this could lead to increased sales of illicit white brands on Moore Street and other street markets throughout the country.  While 79% of the retail price of cigarettes goes directly to the Exchequer, there will be no such contribution from the branded packs that will continue to be sold on Moore Street or at Balbriggan market, regardless of this Bill.<\/p><p> A second consequence is that while the Minister intends that smokers can only buy a pack of John Player Blue in a plain pack in Ireland, Irish holidaymakers or day travellers can buy the same branded pack for literally half the price in Spain and Portugal.  One assumes that this fear of tobacco tourism is the reason that the Department of Health stated in an EU submission in 2010 that &ldquo;the introduction of generic or plain packaging must be on the basis of robust evidence.  If such a measure is to be introduced, it should be mandatory and there should be a harmonized approach across all Member States.\"  Instead, we now have a solo run by Ireland despite failing to come up with the robust evidence that the Department itself called for in 2010.<\/p><p> A third consequence is that the State would send a clear message to the international business community that their valuable intellectual property would not be protected.  Who would invest in Ireland when, without robust evidence and when other less draconian alternatives are available, the State proceeds to seize a company's assets?  The fact that a regulatory impact assessment has not even been conducted in advance of this proposal will surely set alarm bells ringing in the headquarters of Irish and foreign multinationals.<\/p><p> The Minister has correctly lauded the model of universal health insurance as applied in the Netherlands because it delivers results.  This same approach should be applied to tobacco control - learn and adopt from what works and delivers results rather than trying to implement a policy that is as yet unproven, has been abandoned by the EU and brings with it too many negative consequences.  <\/p><p> While John Player is opposed to plain packaging, we are not in any way opposed to preventing minors from smoking.  However, this proposed measure must be reconsidered for the reasons already outlined.  There is no robust evidence that it would achieve its stated aim, there are too many negative consequences and there are proven alternative education-based solutions from other jurisdictions that deliver reductions in minors smoking.  The criteria for introducing new laws should be based on objective fact, real world robust evidence and demonstrable results.  There is no evidence, there are no results and no regulatory impact assessment was conducted to justify this Bill.  <\/p><p> This does not mean we cannot and should not immediately implement measures to prevent minors from smoking.  We can do so by implementing programmes to give minors the life skills to be able to say \"No\" to peer pressure when it comes to tobacco use or indeed other habits, by preventing minors from accessing tobacco by prosecuting any retailer that sells tobacco to those under age and by resourcing the enforcement authorities to put the criminals who sell illegal cigarettes out of business.  I thank the committee.  Dr. Gietz and I are happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Meagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392289800,"counter":790,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Meagher for his presentation.

I am joined by Mr. Michiel Reerink from our regulatory department.<\/p><p>  Japan Tobacco International acquired Gallaher in 2007.  Today, we supply tobacco products to more than 4,000 retailers across the country as well as employing more than 100 people.  Our business is based on a number of core principles.  Tobacco products carry risk to health and, therefore, appropriate and proportionate regulation of the tobacco sector is necessary and right.  Everyone in Ireland should be reminded about the health risks of smoking.  Most importantly, minors should not smoke nor should they be able to access or buy tobacco products.<\/p><p>  In line with the regulatory impact assessment guidelines of the Department of the Taoiseach, a regulatory impact assessment must be conducted before a memorandum goes to Government seeking permission to regulate.  The memorandum and heads of a Bill must be accompanied by a draft regulatory impact assessment.  Despite the far-reaching consequences of the plain packaging proposal, we are concerned that no regulatory impact assessment has been completed to date.  Therefore, we believe that the committee should call for an independent and robust regulatory impact assessment to be completed and reviewed by the committee and all Government Departments before the plain packaging Bill goes any further.<\/p><p>  I am sure the committee is well aware that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, led discussions at an EU level on the revision of the tobacco products directive during the Irish Presidency.  The outcome of these talks was that the member states and later the European Parliament agreed that plain packaging should not be included in the revised directive.  However, the committee should also be aware that measures proposed within this directive will change the current landscape of tobacco across Europe.<\/p><p>  The directive includes requirements to increase health warnings to 65% of the pack and a ban on certain pack shapes, including the current packaging for slim cigarettes.  Therefore, with the changes expected as a result of the directive, why does the Irish Government need to introduce plain packaging in Ireland?<\/p><p>  Let me tell the committee the three primary reasons JTI is so opposed to plain packaging.  First, there is no credible evidence that plain packaging will actually achieve public health benefits.  We believe it will make the situation worse.  Second, the proposed legislation will prevent us from communicating with our consumers about our brands and their right to receive this from us.<\/p> <p>Third, it will deprive us of our property, by removing our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors.  If the proposals on plain packaging are implemented, there is no doubt in our mind that it will damage competition, will infringe rights and freedoms, including those enshrined in European law, will raise barriers to trade and will ultimately result in a loss of jobs across Ireland.<\/p><p> The concept of plain packaging is based on an outdated notion of smoking behaviour.  Regulators and academics tell us that children start smoking for many reasons.  It is a combination of factors such as peer pressure, which plays a major role, and family and parental influence, which is also an important factor.  The real key enabler is access to and availability of cheap tobacco products.  It is not, however, the packaging of cigarettes.<\/p><p> Let me tell members more about the role of packaging.  As with most consumer goods companies, brands are central to our business.  We invest and innovate in packaging, design and quality so that we can compete with other products available to adult smokers, who, knowing the risks of smoking, want to smoke.  Let me stress that we do not target children.  A key challenge is to ensure that children cannot access tobacco products.<\/p><p> The best way to achieve this is to maintain a regulated and highly disciplined market where tobacco can be sold legally and stamp out the selling of untaxed and unregulated tobacco at a fraction of the price to children by organised criminals and illegal traders.  These people do not care about the quality of the product or about the age of the child to whom they sell it.  Let nobody be under any illusion - one of the serious consequences of plain packaging is that it will lead to a further growth in this highly lucrative illegal and unregulated trade in Ireland.  The introduction of plain packaging will also increase children's access to tobacco in the unregulated market as prices are at least 50% cheaper than those of our disciplined retailers.  <\/p><p> The Government's own reports state that when measuring levels of smoking, the vulnerable and disadvantaged are more at risk.  The inevitable growth of the illicit trade, which is already too high, will only serve to further exacerbate this problem.  We firmly believe that methods that are evidence based must be introduced to achieve public health benefits.  As I mentioned earlier, we must prevent minors from accessing tobacco products.  This can be done by reinforcing the age limit, by devising meaningful policies that make it harder for children to get their hands on tobacco, and punishing adults who knowingly buy tobacco products for children and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Freda","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392290400,"counter":793,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the D&aacute;il.

Ireland has one of the highest youth smoking rates for the under 15 years age cohort in Europe.  When we compare the uptake of smoking by youths in Ireland and Germany, the Eurobarometer data in 2012 shows the uptake among the under 15 years age cohort in Germany was 17% compared with the 28% uptake in Ireland, when a decade ago the levels were similar.  We believe an education programme for primary and secondary level school pupils could be successful here in Ireland.  We respectfully ask the committee members to consider this as one of a number of serious alternatives to the plain packaging proposal as they formulate their recommendations to the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>  There is absolutely no credible evidence that plain packaging has had a positive health impact in Australia or that it would have such an impact in Ireland.  More than 14 months after its implementation in Australia, there is still no official government assessment that plain packing has worked.  In fact, the absolute lack of evidence reaffirms the point that packaging is not the reason that people start or even stop smoking.  The introduction of plain packaging would increase children's access to tobacco and in particular to children in disadvantages parts.  There are proven ways to reduce further the youth smoking rate in Ireland and these should be prioritised.  We do not dispute the risks associated with tobacco use.  Plain packaging legislation will not help reduce smoking rates in Ireland and it is for these reasons we strongly oppose plain packaging.

I represent the smokers&rsquo; group Forest &Eacute;ireann.  \"Forest\" stands for Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco.  Forest &Eacute;ireann was set up in 2010.  We are supported by Forest UK, which was founded in 1979 to represent adults who choose to smoke tobacco and non-smoking adults who are tolerant of adults who smoke.  Forest UK is supported by British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco Limited and Gallaher Limited, which is part of the Japan Tobacco International group of companies.  Neither Forest UK nor Forest &Eacute;ireann represents or speaks for the tobacco industry.  We do not promote smoking or any tobacco product or brand.  We have a completely independent set of goals, centred on the right to smoke a legal product without undue harassment or discrimination.  As a smoker, I am here to offer the perspective of the consumer who chooses to smoke tobacco in full knowledge of the health risks associated with smoking, which are very well documented.  I am also here to offer an insight into why people, including children, start smoking.<\/p><p>  With regard to today&rsquo;s hearing, we believe the case for standardised packaging of tobacco is based on the fallacy that children are attracted to smoking because of exposure to colourful or glitzy packaging and that without branding far fewer children or young people would be tempted to start smoking.  This argument is based on speculation and conjecture, rather than on hard fact.  There is no credible evidence that standardised packaging will have any effect on youth smoking rates.  I started smoking because a friend offered me a cigarette and it became a daily social habit we engaged in and shared secretly together until we turned 18.  Some 44 years later, we are still friends.  Speaking personally, plain packaging will make no difference to me.  I will simply ask for my regular brand of tobacco.  I should add that when I am abroad in an EU country, if I choose to do so I can legally bring home a year's supply of local EU-duty paid tobacco.  If Ireland adopts a unilateral approach to plain packaging, I expect that branded packs purchased abroad will be popular with many consumers as a symbol of passive rebellion.<\/p><p>  The display of tobacco has been banned in Ireland since 2008.  Smokers have to ask for their preferred brand before it is handed to them.  Normally, they put it directly into their pocket or handbag.  When a cigarette packet sees the light of day, it is normally in the company of other smokers outside the door.  I suggest, therefore, that cigarette packets are already largely invisible to children.  We believe the introduction of plain packaging is gesture politics.  It will not stop children smoking.  There are other more important issues the Department of Health should prioritise in 2014.  In a recent poll by Red C for Forest &Eacute;ireann, just 9% of those surveyed said they believe standardised packaging is the policy most likely to reduce youth smoking rates in Ireland.  In contrast, more than half of those surveyed thought health education in schools would be the most effective way of reducing smoking rates.  Plain packaging ranked fourth of four suggested priority issues for the Minister for Health in 2014, with just 4% of respondents thinking it should be prioritised.  In contrast, 45% of those polled wanted the Minister to prioritise the health budget overspend.  It is interesting that 32% were worried about childhood obesity.  Some 18% were worried about under age drinking, which is quite topical at the moment.<\/p><p>  The current Minister for Health has made plain packaging of tobacco a personal crusade even though a very small minority of people think it is the best way to stop children smoking.  Even fewer want it to be his main priority.  We are concerned that plain or standardised packaging represents another step towards a nanny state in which adult consumers are increasingly infantilised by politicians who do not trust us to make decisions for ourselves.  As consumers, we are also concerned about the slippery slope - the idea that once standardised packaging is introduced for tobacco, the policy will be adopted for alcohol, convenience foods and other potentially unhealthy products.  We believe the treatment of smokers over the last ten years is setting a dangerous precedent in a democracy because the same tactics can now be applied to the consumers of other products we freely choose to spend our money on.  How long will it be before public health campaigners call for alcohol, fatty food, sugar or even confectionary to be sold in plain packaging?<\/p><p>  We do not want children to smoke.  Smoking should be a choice for informed adults only.  We support all reasonable measures that prevent or discourage children from purchasing or consuming tobacco.  The proposal to introduce standardised packaging is neither reasonable nor justified.  There is no credible evidence to suggest it will work.  If the Government really wants to protect children from smoking, it should seek tougher enforcement of existing laws and focus on further education, primarily in schools but also in the home.  Most important, perhaps, the State of the Nation's Children report, which was published by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2012, highlights the fact that children in more disadvantaged areas are most likely to smoke.  In our view, it would be better for the nation's health if the Government were to address this issue rather than focusing on distractions like plain packaging.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting Forest &Eacute;ireann to attend today's hearing today.  We are pleased the committee has recognised that the consumer is a legal stakeholder in this debate.

If one were to listen to what they had to say, one would be convinced that the tobacco industry is a benign industry that is well aware of its social obligations and its obligations to consumers.  When one looks at the international evidence, however, one finds that is clearly not the case.  There is a strong body of evidence to show that the tobacco industry internationally is quite an insidious invasive industry.  It targets younger people.  It takes an aggressive targeting approach in Latin America, Africa, the Caribbean and Asia.  Some of the tobacco companies to which I refer are represented here.  The witnesses have acknowledged that smoking has some health implications.  It was accepted in the opening presentation that smoking causes cancer and other illnesses.  That is well documented.  It is much more than that, however - it is a killer habit which has a devastating impact on people's lives.  I think any state is entitled to make reasonable policy decisions, and support them with legislation, to try to reduce the level of smoking in that country.  The purpose of plain packaging would be to discourage people from smoking.  In addition to discouraging young people from starting to smoke, it would also discourage older people from smoking.  The same thing applies to the introduction of graphic design.

Its customers die and it needs new customers.  There is no point in recruiting a customer who is 75 years of age.  The tobacco industry wants to recruit them at 12, 13, 14 and 15 years because the longer a person smokes, the more addicted he or she becomes and the more tobacco products he or she will buy.  We live in a commercial world and we know what the tobacco industry is about.  I am not arguing that the tobacco industry aggressively targets children here but it does so elsewhere in the world.  <\/p><p>  I read some of the transcripts of the hearings in the US Congress and Senate.  The tobacco industry did not do itself any favours at the hearings.  For years, it denied that smoking had health implications or that the industry took an aggressive approach to making tobacco as addictive as possible in order that people would continue to smoke.  The credibility of the industry has been shattered internationally.  For this reason, the State has an obligation to try to protect its citizens from a deeply damaging product.  That tobacco is legally promoted around the world with the permission of governments and revenue authorities should not prevent us from doing everything possible to discourage as many people as we can from starting to smoke and encouraging those who smoke to stop. <\/p><p>  If it is the witnesses' contention that there is no evidence to support the view that plain packaging will persuade people to stop smoking and prevent young people from starting smoking, why are they concerned about the proposal?  Japan Tobacco International took the Australian Government to court to prevent the implementation of plain packaging for cigarettes.  It is farcical to suggest that evidence should be available to show plain packaging works within 14 months of its implementation.  Tobacco is an addictive substance and I would expect the witnesses to appreciate that one would need more than 14 months to produce evidence to show whether plain packaging works or otherwise.<\/p><p>  I hope plain packaging will be introduced here and I hope it works.  In the meantime, we should do everything possible to encourage people to give up smoking.  Mr. Mallon may argue that smokers take a rational decision based on free will to continue to smoke.

I note the following statement from the representative of P.J. Carroll, Mr. Donaldson: \"Let me say that we fully accept that smoking causes serious and fatal diseases.\"  In fairness to him, he did not state that this applies only to children and young people, but across the board.  It is extremely important that we recognise that smoking tobacco causes serious and fatal diseases for all smokers, irrespective of when they start smoking.  What the industry does not accept are the consequences of accepting that this is the case.  It has, using the substantial resources available to it, resisted all efforts by the State to properly engage with people who smoke, with a view to combating the smoking habit and attraction of smoking.  At every turn, the tobacco industry has sought to challenge the State in its efforts to reduce smoking and it continues to do so.  The presence of the witnesses indicates that this pattern continues and its outlook remains the same.<\/p><p>  While the tobacco industry is on the wane in developed countries, sadly its product is acquiring a new future in developing regions.  I have no doubt that significant and new public health issues will present in many countries across the globe because more and more people are being encouraged to take up tobacco smoking.  I regret that very much.<\/p><p>  The bald fact is that the witnesses are representatives of an illness industry.  I have no other way of phrasing that statement given the cost that tobacco has imposed on the lives of ordinary citizens over many decades not only in terms of the health of many individuals, but also in terms of the cost to each person who provides for health care services.  With all respect, it is time for payback.  We have been burdened with an inordinate additional financial responsibility and others have had to bear the consequences of having their lives shortened or experiencing serious illness through the use of the products the tobacco industry manufactures.  <\/p><p>  Many of the witnesses referred to the black market and I agree it must be stamped out.  Who is producing the cigarettes that feed the black market trade?  From where do these products come?  Are any of the companies represented here involved in the provision of products that enable black market profiteers to carry out their illicit trade?  Do the witnesses know who is producing these goods?  These are serious matters which need to be brought to the attention of the authorities not only on the basis that they cost the Exchequer, but because they have  legal implications.  This issue cannot be addressed independently of whatever knowledge the witnesses may have in this regard.<\/p><p>  Mr. Meagher from John Player stated he fully agreed with the Chief Medical Officer in respect of the evidence from Australia.  He then stated: \"The ban on press advertising, the ban on smoking in pubs, the ban on ten packs, the ban on display of tobacco in shops and significant excise increases have not had any measurable impact on smoking rates.\"  I disagree fundamentally.  All of the measures cited by Mr. Meagher have had a positive impact.  Statistics are often abused and misused.  I know many people who may have been enticed to take up smoking but have not done so.  Collectively, the measures to which Mr. Meagher referred have made a contribution in this regard.  It is impossible to measure the potential of the introduction of the plain packaging measure.<\/p> <p>He is right to say that the evidence is not phenomenal in terms of the Australian experience but it is part of a package of measures and is part of what has been described here and I accept the view on momentum.<\/p><p> It is an inevitable momentum that the industry should face up to and its collective minds and skills and talents would be better employed addressing an alternative sustainable future for its employees that would make a very positive contribution not only to the industry but to the lives of the broader mankind.  My only question to each of the witnesses, except John, who, in fairness, has been upfront and I know exactly where he is coming from and I have many friends who are on the same page with him.  I say, well done, I have heard everything he has had to say and respect it.

Therefore, we are not alone in this discussion and it is not just Australia.  At the hearings at these meetings, which no doubt the industry has been following, we have had some really compelling evidence so I find it difficult when I am being told there is no evidence.  We have had compelling evidence from medical specialists and children's groups.  The evidence from the children's groups, for me as a children's rights activist, is that while the industry hears what is being said, it does not target children.  The reality is that in Ireland, we know that 78% of those who will start smoking today will be under 18 years of age.  Either the companies' marketing campaigns are seriously misdirected or there is a targeting of children.  We heard from children themselves at this committee about how the packaging is attractive to them.  In Ireland we need 50 new smokers per day, that means 39 will be under 18 every day, and we know that the industry's business model will collapse if it does not get them.  That is the position I am coming from on this issue and the reason I fully support plain packaging.<\/p><p>  The witnesses cited the experience in Germany about education and the use of education.  I am sure other colleagues will come in on this issue.  Germany has the same smoking rate for 12 to 17 year olds as Ireland which is 12%.  Germany's evidence on youth smoking rates is clear from increased taxation and its smoking bans.  In regard to marketing, the industry is quick to say that marketing is not attracting children.  Can the industry give us access to its marketing data for \"lipstick packs\", for example, if it is so assured of its evidence? <\/p><p>  With regard also to the marketing of children, I saw a BBC documentary in 2008 which clearly showed the marketing to children in Africa, selling cigarettes in singles.  The witnesses presented some figures today but the figures I trust are those from the HSE national tobacco control office which states that the rate is not 970,000 but 750,000 smokers in Ireland, which is 22%.  We have heard this morning that there was no evidence from Australia.  The Australian TV channel, ABC News fact check team, actually investigated that claim and refutes the claim put forward by the industry that there is no evidence.  Perhaps the witnesses would watch it themselves.  <\/p><p>  We have been told this morning that plain packaging will create a big opportunity for criminals.  I suggest the witnesses read the recently published European Parliament's budgetary committee report which states  \"The single most important factor that will influence the size of the illicit cigarette market in Europe is the business strategy of the cigarette manufacturers\".  We have also heard that we will not have any criminal gangs behind the tobacco smuggling before this joint committee and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, was cited.  Perhaps the witness can explain why that same Minister for Finance said in the House that he suspected the legal tobacco industry of involvement of production in illicit cigarettes.  Every year, the tobacco industry claims to us that high prices will increase smuggling, but it increases it own prices.  It is not just taxation that increases prices.  The witness speak about illicit white brands on Moore Street.  The only reliable research we have is from the HSE national tobacco control office which shows a smuggling rate of 13% in Ireland but of that 13% it states that 1% is counterfeit and virtually all of the rest comes from legal industry.  In other words, counterfeit tobacco in an Irish context is virtually irrelevant and I do not think it provides any valid argument.  The witnesses cited the KPMG report which I could go through.   However, there is one quote I like to take from it on page 25 which states that the KPMG's project star data cannot be used to estimate the illicit cigarette market in the EU because the report was commissioned to meet specific terms of reference which are only known to Philip Morris International and KPMG.  Therefore, the witnesses should not use it and cite it as a credible report.<\/p><p>  May I ask a question of Forest &Eacute;ireann because it was originally set up by the industry trade body.

My father used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and he died of lung cancer at the age of 74.  In fairness to my father, however, he never smoked in the house, which was a good thing.<\/p><p>  Some 5,200 Irish people die every year from smoking related diseases.  Smoking is responsible for almost one in five of all deaths.  To maintain smoking rates at their current level, the tobacco industry needs to recruit 50 new smokers every day.  It is targeting our young children to achieve that.  Irish smokers start smoking at the youngest age in Europe, just 16 years of age.  Smoking is the number one cause of preventable deaths in Ireland.  It costs the health service &euro;650 million.<\/p><p>  Cigarette packaging is a key method of marketing a message to our children.  They are thin, slender and pink cigarette packets are aimed at young girls.  The tobacco control policy of successive Irish governments has followed World Health Organization best practice.  As far as I am concerned, it has worked.  In 1998, 33% of the population smoked, while today the figure is 22%.  <\/p><p>  I wish to ask Mr. Donaldson a few questions.  Where do the ingredients of cigarettes come from and should they be regulated?  Are e-cigarettes affecting the sale of normal cigarettes?

I have read the submissions by the tobacco industry and listened carefully, as others have done this morning, to their presentations.  I will limit myself to three points.  The message coming from the tobacco industry is an attempt to get some high ground on the issue by saying that it is not targeting children.  That message has been repeated here, using different language.  The industry representatives say that is not where the new consumers are and that they are not enticing children to smoke.<\/p><p>  Someone said it was not a good thing for children to smoke.  Does that imply that it is a good thing for adults to smoke?  I do not think so.  As a former nicotine addict for too many years, I can say that it is not an easy addiction to shift.  It is widely recognised internationally - except within the tobacco industry - that nicotine is more addictive than hash, heroin or cocaine.  It is in a place of its own.  As adults we have to stand up to this problem.  Other speakers have mentioned the health costs involved.<\/p><p>  The industry representatives have invested a lot of time in their submissions citing the Australian model to say that plain packaging is impotent and will have no significant effect on discouraging people from smoking.  If that is the case, why are they here?<\/p><p>  They are pulling this trick out of the book to say that there is some relationship between intellectual property rights and the 1937 Constitution.  If they went down to the Law Library the most junior of barristers would tell them that there would be no hope of them being able to sue the State over plain packaging.  That is because, assuming that this plain packaging goes ahead, the State will not materially benefit from it.  The witnesses know that.  I know why they are lobbying me and other Members about this constitutional question that the State might be sued.  It is to have some effect and to get enough Deputies to wobble and stand up to the prospect of the Minister introducing the measure.  The industry's argument does not stand up legally.  Apart from that, the industry representatives are having the opposite effect by trying to zone in on 84 Deputies to get them to oppose the proposal by the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300009#J02400","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392292800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>Deputy Ciara Conway took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1392292800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here.  I do not want to be smart but I thank each of them for the employee representatives, who happen to live in my constituency, that they sent to my constituency offices to lobby me in recent weeks on the basis that they are losing their jobs.  It was a cute move.<\/p><p>  I would respect the industry representatives if they said the packaging measures we are introducing will have a serious impact on their bottom line and that would cause their businesses a problem.  I would respect that and we could have a conversation accordingly.  They have come in here, however, and said that they do not target children.  They said there was no conclusive evidence arising from the Australian initiative.<\/p> <p>They claim that there is conclusive evidence that contraband, supplied by their own industry, will go through the roof in this country, in spite of all the contrary evidence provided by the Department and especially the Revenue Commissioners.  If the witnesses came in and sincerely engaged with us, they would get a different reaction.  I do not believe there is a single person in this room who does not believe that tobacco companies specifically target children in order to get new customers.  On that basis, I have no respect for the witnesses.  I have four small children at home.   They are not getting their hands on them.<\/p><p> The regulatory impact assessment is not about asking Mr. Meagher's opinion.  The decision has been made by the Government that this policy will be enacted.  It was about providing the industry with the opportunity to make submissions.  If one were to entertain the notion that the industry was only engaging with its own consumers, where do the witnesses propose to get the extra 50 customers per day?

It is good to hear both sides of the argument.<\/p><p>  Back in 1964, Luther Terry, the then US Surgeon General, identified that smoking was a cause of death.  The average number of people who die in this country as a direct result of smoking is 5,000 per annum, so a 250,000 people have died in the 50 years since 1964.  That is greater than the number of people killed in conflicts that are reported on our news bulletins every night.<\/p><p>  The witnesses identified this whole issue in respect of property rights.  In particular, they referred to articles in the Constitution about property rights.  How are those rights established?  How can the witnesses maintain that the State has an obligation to them to protect those rights, when the State also has a legal obligation to protect the health of its citizens?  All the evidence shows that 5,000 people per annum are dying as a result of smoking.   If a pharmaceutical product was being sold in our pharmacies and was identified as causing death, the Government would be obliged immediately to remove that product off the market, yet the witnesses want us to leave everything as is in respect of dealing with something that is causing death.<\/p><p>  To go back to the property rights issue, if I am the owner of land, the ESB is entitled to put electric wires over my land and I am not entitled to compensation.  People might not be aware of it, but that is the position, because the provision of electricity is for the benefit of the citizens.  Likewise, the work being carried out by the Minister for Health on trying to reduce the number of smokers is for the benefit of all the citizens.  We can use all the arguments that it will not help, but every step that we take is there with the intention of trying to reduce the number of people smoking.  The submission from John Player &amp;amp; Sons refers to fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.  Perhaps Mr. Meagher might identify what particular article he is talking about in the charter, because there is also an obligation on the State to protect the health of its citizens.  If we do not take on this problem, then the State is failing in its duty to its citizens.  Do the witnesses not accept that under the Constitution, the State is also obliged to protect of its citizens, and that people's health takes precedence over property rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300010#K00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1392293400,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I am a mother of five children, two of whom smoke and with whom I have a constant battle to give up cigarettes.  My role as a member of this committee is to listen and learn, and to be educated about medical and well being issues that affect the people we represent.  After that, my role is to respond to observations and give my own life's opinion, because that is why I am here.  I could repeat many of the questions that have already been asked, but I will just ask one or two more instead.  As to the argument whether there are 970,000 or 750,000 smokers here, everybody in this room has said that over 5,000 people die every year through illnesses related to smoking.  That is a very important figure for the witnesses to keep in their heads.  Have any of them ever visited the respiratory unit of any hospital across the country?  Have any of them ever walked in and saw the effect, not only on the patient in the bed, but the effect on the families and friends around the patient?  It is unreal.<\/p><p>  The witnesses claim that they do not target children.  They said that smoking is an adult thing to do.  What about the 21% of adults - young women - who smoke during their pregnancies?  Does that not target the unborn child?  I believe that it does, and 50% of those children end up seriously ill in respiratory units in perinatal clinics.  A great number of stillbirths result from that as well.<\/p><p>  If any of the witnesses have children, would they hand an 18 year old a packet of cigarettes and tell them to smoke them because they will not do them any harm?  Looking at my 31 year old and my 21 year old at home, and having buried family members who smoked through their lives, I am not convinced at all that anything said today is marketable.  I would not like to be in their job.  Being a politician is a very difficult job, but I would not like to be in any of the witnesses' shoes, because they are marketing people out there to kill themselves.  As for Mr. Mallon, I hope he brings some of his members into the accident and emergency in St. James's Hospital, particularly into the respiratory unit.

Tobacco is an emotive topic, so it has generated a heated response.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question about who is bringing in the black market and some of the accusations made about industry involvement, I have the seizure rates from the Revenue Commissioners for 2012.  If we go through the companies, we find that 87% of what is coming in is what is known as \"illicit whites\".  These are brands such as Raquel Master, which are coming from Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates.  They have nothing to do with the legitimate companies here.   We also find that 11% of what is coming in is counterfeit.  I can assure members that my company is not involved in smuggling into Ireland.  We want to eradicate smuggling globally.  We have a strong presence in terms of what we are trying to do on smuggling, which my colleague will talk about later.  We actively work with the Revenue Commissioners and with the Customs and Excise here, and with the Garda, to try to tackle smuggling in Ireland.  We supplied hundreds of leads which have led to successful criminal prosecutions.   The largest seizure in the history of the State - 120 million cigarettes were found in Greenore in 2009 - happened after intelligence was supplied by tobacco companies.  We are absolutely committed to reducing smuggling here.  Smuggling deprives the Exchequer of money and funds criminality in society, but also it critically undermines health objectives, because we believe that these products are being sold to children at half the price.  Therefore, we should all work together because if we can all agree on one thing, it is that if we are going to allow adult citizens in Ireland to smoke, then it should be supplied by a legal supplier.<\/p><p>  I spoke to David Crow, who is my counterpart in Australia, about the black market.  We know from Australia is that the long-term consumption trend was -3% of people who smoke cigarettes in that country.  That has stayed pretty stable.  It has dropped to -2% in the year since plain packaging has come in.<\/p> <p>What we can see as well is that the amount of illicit trade has grown rapidly in the first six months.

To be clear - David Crow said this to me - we were looking for an independent body.  The company currently works for the Australian Government, the Irish Government and the Department of Health.  A person in my shoes has to decide how to evaluate what is a difficult problem to estimate.  I decided to choose a legitimate global consultancy company to put in place the best methodology.  In Europe, the methodology used to evaluate the illicit trade is endorsed by the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF.  It is a reputable company and I am asking the committee members to consider its submission on these grounds and to invite the company in if necessary.  That is what is going on in Australia.<\/p><p>  What we see in Australia at the moment is that there is a major growth in illicit whites available here.  This surprised us a little because we had expected there to be more growth in the counterfeit trade.  Counterfeit product is growing but the trade in illicit whites is growing faster.  These include brands like Manchester which, the report states, has gone from a 0.3% share before plain packaging came in to a 1.3% share and up as high as 3.8% in Sydney.  These are being smuggled in by triads and biker gangs throughout the country.  The largest ever seizures in Australia took place last October.  We know for certain that the black market has been thriving since plain packaging has come in.  That is why I raise it as a problem for Ireland because Ireland has the largest rate of non-Irish duty paid products in the country in all of western Europe.  It is a serious problem and I believe it is undermining health objectives.

I will outline the international context around smuggling.  It is a global problem.  I will discuss the problem mainly in respect of Europe.  A large number of people in our company are dedicated to helping law enforcement officials throughout the world to combat smuggling.  In Europe we signed a voluntary agreement in 2010 with the European Anti-Fraud Agency, OLAF.  The agreement runs for 20 years and is worth &euro;200 million.  I say as much to signify that we make a significant commitment to combat smuggling.  That is to support our view that we want smuggling eradicated if possible, in the same way as we have an objective that we share with the committee to eradicate children's take-up of smoking.<\/p><p>  I wish to emphasise why we are here.  It is to talk about the plain packaging proposal, a proposal to remove branding from packs of cigarettes and other tobacco products.  I contend that this is not the right mechanism to use to achieve the objectives of reducing smoking rates or to stop children from smoking.<\/p><p>  We have seen the evidence from Australia.  I agree that it is early days but the evidence from there does not lie.  Smoking rates in Australia have not dropped and smuggling is on the rise.  We must continue to monitor that situation but it supports the view that plain packaging is not the right way of achieving those objectives.  All it will do is remove legitimately and legally registered trademarks which have value not only to companies but also to consumers, since it gives them reassurance around the origin and quality of the product they buy.

We make approximately &euro;7.9 million in Ireland.  Some 87.4% of our total revenue goes to the Government in taxes and excise.  We have pension contributions of approximately &euro;3 million to consider.  I am unsure where the figure of &euro;227 million comes from but we have a 17% share of the market and that figure seems greatly overstated.<\/p><p>  Do I smoke or not?  Someone asked that question.  I do not smoke regularly.  I smoke only when I am out with some friends.  I am not a regular smoker.  Would I like my children to smoke?  No, I know what the serious risks of smoking are so I would not like my children to smoke.  I will educate them and I hope that some of the proposals that we have suggested relating to education in different countries can be introduced to ensure that children who grow up in Ireland are fully aware and are not suspect to any peer pressure to smoke.  Clearly, at the moment, the education systems we have in place are not working as effectively as they could, because we have got a youth initiation rate.  I commend some of the initiatives that have taken place, like the Exhale Session from the Irish Cancer Society which is exactly the type of peer pressure or peer influence programme that can work in Ireland.  We have seen similar models work in Sweden, where they have a duo programme which I call on the committee members to consider.  They have a big buddy system where a senior person works with a junior person or teenager and makes a commitment not to smoke for three years.  They get loyalty cards and incentives and go to events off the back of them.  These are the types of initiatives that I call on the committee to consider.<\/p><p>  Questions were asked about branding overall and Vogue specifically.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has raised the Vogue pink pack on several occasions as a matter of concern.  That brand was researched among 20 to 35 year old female adult smokers who smoke a competitor brand - I do not intend to go into the branding.  The brand is aimed at that group solely.  There should be no access to any consumers under it.  We have no research to indicate anyone other than adults females between the ages of 20 and 40 years are smoking that brand, to be clear.  In the year and a half since its introduction the pink pack has not worked or generated any sales and has since been de-listed from the market.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, under the tobacco products directive, TPD, that is coming forward 65% of the top of a pack will be a health warning.  What we are effectively talking about is whether the bottom strip of 35% of the pack can carry legal trademarks.

I would not want my children to smoke.  Smoking is for adults.  I am very clear about that.<\/p><p>  I want to be sure that I answer all the questions.  In response to the question about profit, on a turnover of &euro;420 million, &euro;345 million goes to the Government in duty.  We have a net profit of &euro;19 million, of which we pay over &euro;13 million to our pension fund.  There are over 500 pensioners in the fund.  We support that to the tune of over &euro;1 million a month.<\/p><p>  In response to some of the specific questions directed to me, Deputy Kelleher spoke about the need for the State to protect adults.  I agree with that point too.  I acknowledge he is not suggesting that we target children but the State must act.  We fully agree the State must act but it must do so on the basis of real evidence but the evidence to date shows that its action has not been effective.  That brings me to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s point.  He noted that in my submission I said the current tobacco control approach is not working and he disagreed with me.  In the past ten years smoking in public places, the sale of packets of ten and display have been banned.  There have also been significant increases.  Since then, incidence rates have remained stable, according to Eurobarometer.  The price and regulation have gone and the illicit sales have gone up.<\/p><p>  All the measurements of whether it is working are going north except the one that is the essence of the action, incidence.  As defined by Eurobarometer, the European Commission&rsquo;s way of measuring incidence, it stands at 29%.  People talked about 22% but that is the office of tobacco control, OTC, measurement.  The committee would expect us to quote independent sources.  According to Eurobarometer 29% of adults were smoking in 2012, and 29% smoked in 2006.  All those measures have not achieved any reduction in incidence.  That is why we are very clear today that if we continue to think that banning is the way to go we will get the same result.  We have to consider something other than ban after ban because they are not working.  These are not our numbers.  They are the European Commission&rsquo;s numbers.  We have to consider education and a different way.  Banning it does not stop it.  One can ban lots of things but this will not go away.

I do not think the intellectual property rights are up for grabs as a matter of principle because property rights are property rights.  Companies like ours in the fast-moving consumer goods industry have three kinds of asset.  These are, in no particular order, our people, our facilities and factories and our brands.  We have invested a lot of money over a long time in each of these three.  If one owns anything and somebody says, for whatever reason, it is a good idea to take it away from one, it is not an irrational or inappropriate reaction on our part to say we do not agree.  Intellectual property rights are an important asset for us, as for any other industry in the fast-moving consumer goods sector.<br \/>As far as unintended consequences go, it has been pointed out that foreign investment in Ireland hinges on, among other things, the security of continuing to enjoy property rights, including the intellectual ones.  I suggest this would send a very disturbing signal to many foreign direct investors into this country, including and foremost, those in the United States, which are the leading direct investors in this country.  According to the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland, 26% of Irish gross domestic product is based on American foreign direct investment.<br \/>Four American Congressmen sent a letter to this committee at the outset of these hearings indicating that property rights should be protected.

The United States has been mentioned and the Centres for Disease Control is quite clear about the type of education.  The young ladies from Tipperary who were here last week confirmed that it will work.  It is not about spreading fear nor about informing that smoking is bad for one's health because everyone knows that.  It is about addressing the triggers that get young people in a situation where they will accept their first cigarette.  It is a case of making them resist these triggers such as peer pressure, family example, insecurity, low self-esteem, which are the elements of intelligent education that work, rather than fear-mongering when everyone knows that smoking is obviously not good for you.<\/p><p>  Our involvement or alleged involvement in illicit trade is an international question I would like to knock on the head.  When the Senator speaks of tobacco companies supplying the illicit market it is not the companies who are sitting here.  It is the companies who are producing the product category that is called illicit whites.  These are legitimate companies in the countries where they make these cigarettes, be it in Russia, in the Middle East, in other places.  They are produced solely for the purpose of export-smuggling into high tax excise countries such as the UK and Ireland.  The fact that they are locally legitimate companies does not mean that the trade is legitimate.  To make my point clear, the illicit whites do not come from the companies who are here.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a final comment.

In 2012, we had a turnover of &euro;670 million and we handed the Government &euro;570 million in excise.  Our net profits after all of our activities was &euro;14.9 million.  We are a market leader with 50% share of the market.  I am not quite sure where this figure of &euro;150 million is derived from because it is certainly not what I saw from the sum of the numbers that were being discussed here.<\/p><p>  I was asked whether I smoke and I do not smoke.  I was asked if I have children.  Yes, I have children.  One of my sons is flirting with smoking.  He is 18 years.  On the question of whether he started smoking before that age, yes, he did.  On the question whether I want him to smoke, no, I do not.  We have a conversation around his smoking and like any other family dealing with that subject, he is an 18 year old adult and he needs to be treated as such.  He will make his choices based on that.  He understands the risks, as I do, but I am not imposing my will on him.  It is a risk he is managing himself.<\/p><p>  On the question about the Silk Cut pack, as Mr. Steven Donaldson highlighted with regard to the Vogue pack, we have that product available as a slims pack which is targeted at adult females who understand the risks and who choose to smoke.  <\/p><p>  In reply to the question about ingredients, similar to what Mr. Donaldson said, our ingredients are totally visible for anyone who wishes to see what is contained in our products.  We are very transparent in that way.  We share the concern about the illicit trade and that concern is fuelled by the evidence.  We see the evidence of that trade growing in Australia as a result of plain packaging and it is a concern.  We have to recognise that Ireland is a country with the highest levels of illicit trade.  We cannot ignore that fact, put it to one side and say that it is not relevant in this conversation.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout highlighted price as one of the key measures.  One of the key impacts and opportunities for illicit trade and the reason criminals are involved is to undermine all of the health initiatives by leveraging price.  Their price is under &euro;4 for a packet of cigarettes sold on the black market.  They prey on the underprivileged parts of our society which are the most vulnerable.  The committee's reports highlight that these are the people most at risk and among whom the prevalence of smoking is highest.  I do not think the illicit trade can be dismissed, be put it to one side and say it is not relevant in this conversation.  We genuinely believe that plain packaging will make the situation worse.  It will not address the public health objectives.  The committee will have heard all of us refer to other incidences in other countries which fundamentally address youth smoking rates and deal with the key issues at the core which are peer pressure and availability.  We are not dealing with the issues that are a problem in Ireland.  I refer to access, for example.  Children here can get hold of cigarettes far too easily.  We need to establish a culture where a child cannot get his or her hands on cigarettes.  However, that is not what is being achieved with plain packaging which is to put a plaster on the situation.  We accept that we are regulated.<\/p><p>  A point was made about how we are replacing our smokers.  We accept that we are operating in a declining market.  We operate in the legal side of this market.  We accept that the market declines in line with the measures which are implemented - and rightly so - and we said so in our statement, such as the measures to educate smokers and to encourage smokers to stop smoking.  We accept the market decline and we compete for what is left in the legal market which is the only thing that interests us.  We were asked why are we opposed to plain packaging.  We are opposed to plain packaging because it stops us from competing.  We have nothing else left.  We have no marketing tools and the pack is the only thing that allows the consumer to make an informed choice about what product they buy.  That consumer is an adult smoker who understands the risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300013#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Freda"},{"type":"speech","time":1392295200,"counter":933,"content":"<p>By Mr. Freda's own admission the slim packs, the menthol cigarettes, are targeted at women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300013#N00900","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392295200,"counter":934,"content":"<p>At adult smokers, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300013#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Freda"},{"type":"speech","time":1392295200,"counter":935,"content":"<p>Women are half the population.

To sum up our position today, I hope we have succeeded in explaining why we are concerned about a measure which will not impact on smoking rates and will not prevent children from starting smoking but will have unintended consequences in terms of fuelling the illicit trade in tobacco.  The proposed measure will not affect smoking rates, but it will affect our ability to compete.  Our objective is to maintain and grow our market shares, but this measure takes away our last branding opportunity.  I remind members that the European directive will double the size of the health warning on the front of packets and increase the warning on the back by 50%.  In other words, two thirds of both the front and back of packets will be given over to the warning, in large letters, that \"Smoking kills\".  The remaining 35% of the pack is the only space available to us to indicate to consumers what brand they are choosing.  That is what we are about here.  We are not opposed to the measure because we are worried it will have an effect on smoking rates.  On the contrary, we are sure it will not have an effect on rates and will not prevent children from starting to smoke.  There are much better and proportionate ways of achieving that objective, as we have outlined today.  We ask the committee to give serious consideration to those suggestions instead of introducing plain packaging in the belief that it will deter children from smoking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300014#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michiel Reerink"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392295800,"counter":951,"content":"<p>As usual, smokers are being passed over in this debate, even though we are the ones affected by the proposal.  The conversation is going on over my head, so to speak.  Like Deputy Catherine Byrne, I am a father - in my case, to two children.  I have taken the view with my children that I would treat them as I was treated growing up.  I did not see the point in banning them from smoking or forbidding them to drink alcohol once they turned 18.  At that point I gave them a free choice in the matter.  I had alcohol and cigarettes at home and I allowed them to make up their own minds, but not before their mother and I talked to them about the dangers of both.  Having no first-hand experience of the illicit drug trade, including the drugs like heroin, cocaine and so on to which reference was made during the meeting, I was unable to advise my children in that regard expect to say that from everything I could see, they were mood-altering, mind-altering and immediately dangerous substances.<\/p><p>  On the other hand, smoking takes quite a long time to have an effect.  There will be people jumping around and saying even one cigarette is deadly, but the reality is that they take years to impact on health.  Tobacco is not a mind-altering or mood-altering substance.

I am merely giving members the benefit of my experience and of the hundreds of discussions I have had with smokers.  Reference was made earlier to the need to engage with smokers.  The problem, as I see it, is that all of the restrictions, bans, penalties and impositions that smokers have endured, including high pricing and so on, do not amount to an engagement with smokers.  It is always about talking at rather than to smokers.  There is a huge chasm between the official line, as reflected in this committee, and the views of  the many smokers I have met throughout the country.  A member observed today that it is difficult to be a politician.  Perhaps there is a general cynicism about the place but I certainly do not get the impression that smokers feel engaged with by Government.  In my view, this lack of engagement is part of the reason that the numbers of smokers are not falling as quickly as members would like.<\/p><p>  From a personal perspective, plain packaging makes no difference to me one way or the other.  I smoke rolled tobacco, which I keep in a tin.  However, this particular proposal is another aspect of the attempt to denormalise smokers, to make an ordinary citizen like me somehow abnormal for doing something which, for all my life, it has been quite normal to do.  I had the right to decide to take up smoking and I have the right to quit.  I have the freedom to make those decisions, as I do in regard to alcohol and all other lifestyle issues.  There is far too much hysteria and drama around this topic.  A bit of common sense is required and an emphasis on education for children.  As it turned out, the education my wife and I gave our children was sufficient for both of them to decide against drinking and smoking.  Moreover, I have seen no evidence, although I probably would not recognise it if I did, that either of them takes drugs.  Applying some degree of common sense and intelligence to the discussion, rather than hysteria and name calling, would be far more beneficial.  That is the view from the smokers' side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300014#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1392295800,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for giving their time to the committee.

The Law Society of Ireland is the representative, educational and statutory regulatory body for solicitors in Ireland.  I have the honour this year to be the president of the society, representing some 10,000 members the length and breadth of the country.They are practising in some 2,200 legal firms and they also act for the public service bodies, industry and other sectors.  Indeed, 16% of our members now work in-house.<br \/>I am here today with perhaps the better known face of the Law Society, the director general, Mr. Ken Murphy.  The Law Society welcomes the opportunity to come before this Oireachtas committee to elaborate on its intellectual property law concerns regarding the proposed Bill.  Let me begin by making it perfectly clear that this society does not represent anybody other than its members.  The society is not here to represent either directly or indirectly the view of the tobacco industry.  We have accepted the invitation to attend today to consider exclusively the intellectual property law aspects of the proposed Bill.  We do not claim to have any expertise in health policy.<br \/>The witnesses who appeared before the committee over the past three sessions, have, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said on one such occasion, come at it &quot;from a variety of experiences and responsibilities in life&quot;, and so too does the Law Society.  It should come as no surprise that many of the society&rsquo;s members represent plaintiffs who are in legal action against both tobacco companies and the State in respect of smoking related injury.  In addition, many members are working for, and alongside key State agencies that play a central role in the fight against illicit trade, including Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some of our members represent those who have been accused of illicit trade.Naturally also some solicitors act as legal advisers to tobacco companies.  Some members of the society work on a daily basis in intellectual property law as it applies to the entire gambit of industry sectors, in particular the food and drinks sector, engineering, information technology and pharmaceutical companies to name but a few.<br \/>For the avoidance of doubt, we are not here to defend the tobacco industry and are not, to use the expression, &quot;in the pocket&quot; of anyone.  We fully accept that tobacco has had a disastrous impact on health.  It is important to us then that the Law Society is not portrayed as representing  anybody other than its members and the public interest which the profession serves.  On this point, it should be noted, for the record, that the Law Society constantly  participates in public consultations on a wide range of issues that affect the public and the profession.  Our contribution and participation has been extensive, on issues from human rights to conveyancing, probate to criminal justice, and all forms of litigation.  In addition to constant interactions with Government Departments and agencies, in the past two years alone, the Law Society has made a total of 20 formal submissions on issues ranging from complex insolvency law reforms, various criminal justice Bills and litigation reforms.  The director general and I were in Leinster House yesterday for the conclusion of the Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill in which of course we would be a stakeholder.  Submissions made by the Law Society, represent the commitment of its 10,000 members to contribute to public discourse, bringing with them the benefit of their legal understanding and professional experiences.<br \/>We are concerned with the legal implications of the concept of plain packaging as such, and how it might affect the standing of intellectual property rights here in Ireland and abroad.  That is to say, we have no issue with the policy objectives underpinning the Bill but we do have concerns regarding its impact on the intellectual property regime in this country.  To put this in context, I would like to preface our substantive submission with the following brief comments.  These are statistics we have put together to show our concern.  The Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in September 2013, stated that along with Germany and Hungary, &ldquo;Ireland has the highest share &ndash; 40.8% - of trade mark-intensive value added in their GDP&quot;.  The above report also states that of all the European states, &quot;the highest share of jobs in IPR-intensive industries generated by companies from outside the EU is to be found in Ireland, at almost 18%&quot;.  EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Union, confirms that there are currently 138,000 people working in knowledge intensive industries and high-end manufacturing in Ireland, such as pharmaceuticals and technology companies where IP assets are their key asset.  This is an increase of 5.3% since 2008.<br \/>We note that no regulatory impact assessment has yet been prepared on the proposed Bill.  We look forward to it to the extent that it will consider what impact the proposals will have on rights under intellectual property law in Ireland.  Clearly it is the proper and important task of the committee and the Oireachtas to strike that careful balance between protecting and maintaining intellectual property law with public health and other relevant public policy considerations.  Our submissions aim to assist the committee by outlining key legal concerns and potential ramifications of plain packaging proposals.<br \/>In February 2013, the society stated and here today again states that:<blockquote>A fully functioning intellectual property system, which operates consistently and transparently across all sectors and provides certainty for intellectual property owners, investors, international partners and traders and members of the public, is vital to the future of both the EU and Irish economies.  Reforms which have the effect of undermining that system should be considered very carefully. <\/blockquote><\/p> <p>We then go on consider the constitutional issues and our submission sets out a key consideration.<blockquote><br \/>The Irish Constitution requires the State to protect property rights and the Irish Supreme Court has previously struck down legislative provisions as unconstitutional where they involved restrictions on the exercise of property rights or a deprivation of rights all together without compensation for such interference.<\/blockquote>In relation to restrictions on property rights, we do not underestimate the crucial role of the legislature in striking that balance, that principle of proportionality.  Our submission emphasises the challenge for the Oireachtas.  The test of proportionality, as developed by the High Court and the Supreme Court, requires, first, that the restriction on use of the trademark must have an objective of sufficient importance to warrant interference with the property right in the mark; second, that the impairment of this right should be minimal as possible; and, finally, the effects on the constitutionally protected right should be proportionate to the objectives sought to be attained.<br \/>Were this matter to come to court, it is likely that the court would be asked to consider evidence available regarding the effectiveness of plain packaging on smoking habits as against the range of other actions that can be considered to minimise or eradicate smoking.  Some of these have been highlighted by other witnesses, such as taxation, educational and cessation initiatives, sanctions and penalties, etc.<br \/>Ireland is a signatory to the World Trade Organization, WTO, and specifically the TRIPS, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, agreement.  Under that agreement, we have committed to respect a number of key provisions that impact on the nature of trademark rights.  We have outlined four of them but for the sake of brevity I do not intend to read through them, save to say that there is a provision that the Government can use the health consideration in order to impact on property rights but it must have regard to the ownership of those property rights.  We then go on to consider the potential exposure for the State.  The Law Society is concerned that the extent of interference envisaged by the proposed Bill may give rise to potential actions against the State, and Europe under the provisions of the TRIPS agreement.<br \/>The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is binding on member states under the Lisbon Treaty and Article 17 of the charter guarantees rights to property, expressly including intellectual property rights.  The European Court of Human Rights has held that property for this purpose includes intellectual property and has distinguished between a straightforward deprivation of property and restricting the use of the property in the general interest.  Consequently, the State runs a risk - and it is that, a risk &ndash; of going beyond regulation and restricting rights which affect the substance of a trademark, in contravention of our international obligations.<br \/>The Law Society submits that restrictions of property rights should be carefully considered, in addition to all other approaches which are less severe but might be likely to have similar consequences.  The court will ask the question, applying an objective test, whether the decision maker &ndash; that is, the Oireachtas &ndash; could reasonably have concluded that the interference was necessary to achieve the legitimate aims recognised by the convention.  The society&rsquo;s intention today is to underline the need for careful and robust examination of the options available.<br \/>The Law Society submits a further concern in respect of our European obligations, namely, that the introduction of plain packaging may give rise to a challenge that it acts as a barrier to the treaty-based freedom of movement of goods.  Put simply, products sold in another members state, would not have the same access to Irish markets as a result of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  Ireland is entitled to rely on a derogation on the grounds of public health, but should anticipate a challenge on that ground.<br \/>In terms of the loss of trademark rights, the fundamental purpose of a registered trademark is to distinguish goods or services of one undertaking from another.  If a trademark ceases to be used, it cannot continue to operate as a distinguisher of origin, quality, etc.  Consequently, and as currently framed, the &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; rule could result in a reduction in intellectual property value for companies, which may give rise to compensation claims payable by the State.  The Law Society is concerned that unintended consequences could result not only in claims against the State, but could also adversely impact on businesses and employment.  The role of the intellectual property, IP, in foreign direct investment should not be underestimated, and perhaps should be included in the regulatory impact assessment of the Bill.<br \/>Tobacco smoking, with its destructive effects on young people &ndash; on all people &ndash; and the burden it presents for the health sector, is an emotive issue.  The basis of our appearance here today is to draw attention to the potential impact of the Bill to the regard in which Ireland is held internationally in respect of intellectual property and to set out generally some key legal concerns for the committee to consider.  The general scheme of the Bill gives rise to unavoidable legal concerns of both an Irish and EU character.  We respect the task that the committee has before it.  We are available to assist with any questions in any way we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300015#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John P.

Mr. Shaw and Mr. Murphy are very welcome.  I will start first with the submission.  It was clearly outlined that it had come from a committee within the Law Society.  I looked up the membership of the committee and the links.  I then contacted the committee to confirm the declaration of interests we received because among the submissions we requested, point 5 clearly outlined what we expected from a declaration of interests.  We had to request the declaration of interests, which we received for the intellectual property law committee and that is all I can talk about now.  I am surprised because as a Member of the Seanad I must declare any interests I have.  When I speak in the Seanad, I declare I am chair of Early Childhood Ireland.  I get zero payment for that but I still declare it.  The most polite description of the declaration of interests we received is that it is opaque.  It does not show the clear links that exist.  If someone can clearly outline when they have a conflict, I expect that legal people will argue for different sides.  I do not expect that members of the Law Society have no links but I am surprised at how loosely worded the declaration is.  Yet, if anyone takes any time to look at the membership of the committee we can see clear links, not just from the companies, that the individual solicitors are clearly working.  It is accepted that solicitors can take business but I take issue with the fact that they cannot declare it.<\/p><p>  In the declaration it says that one member of the committee was previously employed by P.J. Carroll and Company but he was not a member of the committee while so employed.  My question is whether the Law Society has a concern about his previous role in connection with the submission that was made on behalf of the Law Society and how he became a member.  What expertise did he bring forward to qualify him to be a member of the committee?  What I have seen throughout the hearings we have held is that the tentacles of the tobacco industry are everywhere.  We are seeing the same sentences again and again when we receive certain submissions.  I want to be assured of the true impartiality that is being put forward.  The reason I asked the question about the declaration of interests is because of the reference in the submission to smuggling and counterfeit products.  I would have thought that was outside the remit of expertise of the committee on intellectual property law.  That is what sparked my question on declarations of interest.<\/p><p>  The High Court in Australia held that there was no acquisition of intellectual property rights, as the state did not receive any benefit.  If we look at cases in the Irish example, the reality is that they have all been to do with land.  The cases all related to land and involved compulsory purchase orders.  The State has already limited intellectual property rights on advertising and putting health warnings on cigarette packets.  It is a justified and proportionate restriction on the use of trademarks.  The State is not proposing to extinguish any rights.  Is that the understanding of the Law Society?  Will the State extinguish the right or is it about the State restricting and limiting?  The State has a responsibility for the common good and also to ensure the public health.  The State will receive no financial benefit from doing that.  I wonder what the merits of a case would be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300016#R00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1392297000,"counter":961,"content":"<p>First, I had better declare my interest in that I am a member of the Law Society.  I wish to raise the issue of property rights in terms of where the State is taking action that involves public health.<\/p> <p>Submissions the committee received over the past number of weeks clearly indicate that 5,000 people are dying per annum as a direct result of smoking.  I stated this morning that since the Surgeon General in the United States published his report in 1964, some 250,000 have died in this country as a direct result of smoking.  Does the State have an obligation to take every possible action to protect the health of its citizens that takes precedence over property rights?<\/p><p> I raised this second issue already this morning.  The legislation dealing with the ESB that was introduced involved rights to go over land and even though I might be a landowner, I cannot restrict the ESB from going over my land because it was established that there was a need to get electricity supply to every household in the country.  In that case, the landowner's property rights are being infringed upon.  In this case, not only in this decision by the Department of Health but in a number of its decisions to reduce the numbers smoking, we are constitutionally obliged to do everything possible to protect people's health.  I do not understand how property rights could take precedence over the rights of people to live and the right to ensure that we can do everything possible to remove the risks.  Will the Law Society representatives deal with that issue?<\/p><p> The other matter I am a little concerned about is that there is no submission from the Law Society setting out the obligations of the State to reduce the health risks attached to smoking.  The Law Society has told the committee about intellectual property rights, but what about people's right to live and to ensure that their lives are not at risk in any way?  If a drug was being sold in a pharmacy in the morning and it was identified that this would cause death, the State would be obliged to take immediate action to have that drug withdrawn.  The Law Society has not dealt with that in its submission.  I am talking about bringing balance to the submission.  Why not make a submission to us on the obligations of the State to do something in that area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300016#R00400","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392297600,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I thank the Law Society delegation for their presentation.

If so, how much would be involved and are there comparable cases of which they are aware?<\/p><p>  I listened to my colleagues and I have read the presentations.  It seems that the constitutional cases that have been taken have been to do with land but Articles 40.3.2&deg; and 43 of the Constitution recognise that in a civil society property rights have to be regulated by principles of social justice and in accordance with the common good.  The common good will be to protect the health of the Irish people.  I am not quite sure how that can apply and I ask for their professional opinion.<\/p><p>  I also want their professional opinion on how Ireland's name and trademark is recognised in America.

I do not have a legal background and I apologise if the question appears stupid.  I gather from their proposal that everybody has a constitutional right to their property and if the matter ever gets to court, the State would have to prove that the objective hoped to be achieved will be achieved and also that it is more achievable in this way rather than using the string of other measures that are already available to us, and that in doing so it would have to be sufficiently important to warrant the interference with somebody's intellectual property rights.  The objective of this is to save people's lives and to stop children from starting smoking, which seems to be the main objective of the tobacco industry.  That is sufficiently important to warrant the interference.  The measure of the Supreme Court case judgment would be the evidence.  If plain packages are introduced on 1 January next, one cannot take a case on 3 January next because the evidence will not have been allowed to develop and flourish.  How long would it be before the Supreme Court would state that it needed to give this six months, a year or five years so as to test and prove the case?  No doubt a case is coming.

I read the Law Society's submission with interest and the submissions of the various other stakeholders in this pre-legislative consultation.<\/p><p>  I assume the representatives are here because they are advocates not of the tobacco industry, but of the protection of intellectual property rights.  I assume that is their focus.  However, in their submission they strayed into areas such as smuggling.  I am not aware of their expertise on smuggling, but I assume it is not to the fore of their expertise and we will stick with the law as it is.  While they are entitled to have a view on smuggling, I would suggest that there are some inaccuracies in it.  The committee will be aware, for example, that the tobacco companies are part and parcel of smuggling in the sense that most tobacco smuggled into this country is made legitimately by these tobacco companies in other jurisdictions where they flood the market which cheap cigarettes, making it financially viable for smugglers to bring them into this country.  That is what is happening.  It is not that there are factories all over the world making illegal cigarettes.  They are being made legally by these companies, dumped into Third World markets where they flood the market and are then smuggled into here.  That is the illicit trade and that is the way it works.  It is not that cigarettes are being made in bamboo huts in far-flung parts of the world.  They are being made in sophisticated factories throughout the First World.  They should be conscious of that when making their views known.<\/p><p>  On IP itself, from the Law Society's perspective, the only court from which we can take precedents on this issue is the Australian High Court.  The Australian Government's legislative programme was challenged by the tobacco companies and it eventually ended up in the High Court in Australia which, I suppose, would be equivalent to our Supreme Court.  The court found in favour of the Australian Government.  I am trying to tease this out.  Could Mr. Shaw explain what the court found in favour of?  Did it find that the Australian Government had a right possibly to usurp or even undermine the intellectual property rights of individual companies for the greater good?  Was it, in the context of the greater good being the real issue here, that the state was entitled in certain circumstances to protect its citizens by usurping or overriding the intellectual property rights?  I am trying to get a flavour of Mr. Murphy's and Mr. Shaw's interpretation of that issue, bearing in mind they could act for companies that may take this State to court as well.

I assure the members that I am absolutely satisfied there is no interference nor is there any connection whatsoever with anybody in the tobacco industry regarding the manner in which this is being prepared.  Our committee is appointed annually by the incoming president after consultation with the outgoing chairman.  Approximately three pages of questions are raised.  It is asked whether new people are required and what is needed.  It is organised on the basis of the speciality of the committee.  I was involved in the appointment process in September of last year and I had no regard whatsoever to the tobacco industry or the make-up of the committee as it related to that industry.  What I wanted to know was whether the people on the committee had expertise in intellectual property law and that they would do work that was valuable to the society.  Those are the criteria used.<\/p><p>  I do not want to get too legalistic about the declaration but I read through it in detail.  The declaration we made was intended to be of help by way of pointing out that there were people whom members might think are connected to the tobacco industry to some degree, be it remotely or otherwise.  If it is considered loose, I accept the committee's description.  However, the intention is as I have described.  I reviewed it because I wanted to see exactly what it stated.  If I were considering it again, I might just say the Law Society, as it stands, did not have to make any declaration.  That is being overly legalistic in regard to the matter and I would not even go there.  It is not worth doing so as we would be wasting time.  I genuinely believe we made an honest attempt to disclose fully any interest of any person connected with the making of the submission to the committee.<\/p><p>  With regard to the counterfeiting issue, I take Deputy Kelleher's point on smuggling.  Counterfeiting and smuggling are, perhaps, two different issues in terms of the way we examine intellectual property law.  Intellectual property lawyers have an interest in protecting their clients' interest in combating counterfeiting.  I accept that when the submission was made, we were not aware of the evidence that this committee has since learned.  The committee heard evidence this morning from the tobacco industry on the matter.  We were not aware of that.  The committee has heard evidence from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs and Excise that they do not anticipate any significant difference.  We accept that evidence and we have no reason to go against it.  However, the reason people would have examined the counterfeiting issue in respect of intellectual property law was because it came under that umbrella, but it was not by any means their main point.<\/p><p>  Let me move on to property rights and Senator Colm Burke's point, particularly in respect of the ESB.  Neither Mr. Murphy nor I have expertise in intellectual property and we would not advise people who are looking for advice thereon.  We have general legal qualifications.  I, in particular, have dealt with cases involving claims against the ESB for the loss of property rights consequent to its having put pylons over property.  The pertinent distinction concerned whether the property's use was affected.  It was deemed that if there was an existing use, such as farm use, it was not adversely affected, but that if there was planning permission and development potential, it was compensated.  It was the deprivation of use that attracted compensation, not the taking away of the property.  I am jumping a little in that regard because I believe asking us to deal with the question on the Australian case is a little unfair because we do not know enough about it.  We are not experts in Australian law.  We are advised that the Australian provision in regard to the constitution concerns the acquisition by the state of the property.  There would be no such requirement here before one would be entitled to receive compensation of some degree.<\/p><p>  The nuanced position we would make on the case that might be bought is not so much that it would be a question of rights being taken away.  As I understand it, the heading of the Bill provides that the non-use would be considered to be a proper purpose.  The non-use of the trademark would be considered to be a proper purpose to keep the trademark alive and on the register.  However, the way it would work out with the courts here is that a case would be brought contending legislation was introduced that did not provide properly for the payment of compensation for the deprivation of the right, with the risk that the court might say it is unconstitutional.  If I were asked to have an angle on it &ndash; I am not an intellectual property lawyer &ndash; that would be the one I would tackle in this jurisdiction.  However, there are other courts the industry can go to.  <\/p><p>  On the question as to whether it is likely that proceedings will be brought, the Minister for Health himself said he would be absolutely astounded if the tobacco companies did not bring a case challenging this legislation in this jurisdiction.  I would certainly support that view.  They will not let this happen without doing anything about it.  It would be relatively cheap for them to take on a case here as opposed to the United States or areas with other larger population bases where profits may be significantly higher.  The damages and costs here could be significantly lower.  These are just factors that are running through my head as I think about this.  I am not in a position to advise.  I am not sure what other questions arose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300018#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John P. Shaw"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392298200,"counter":970,"content":"<p>All rights in the Constitution are subject to the common good.  Some testing of proportionality is fundamental.  A test of proportionality is imported into Irish law from other jurisdictions, particularly European ones and Canada, and the European Court of Human Rights.<br \/>There is a very good statement in a decision of a former president of the High Court, Mr. Justice Costello, in Heaney <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, 1994.  It looks to the European Court of Human Rights and Canadian jurisprudence.  Mr. Justice Costello said in the course of this judgment that the means chosen must pass the proportionality test, in respect of which he identified three elements.  The means must be rationally connected to the objective and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations; impair the right as little as possible; and be such that their effects on rights are proportional to the objective.  The key issue is that while a forum like this looks to evidence, it is naturally a political forum where opinion has currency also.  Opinion would not have currency in court.  A court would make a decision based on evidence.  Mere assertion would not be sufficient and evidence would have to be required.  It is a question of determining the exact evidence.  If the Australian experience were being cited in justification for or support of the legislation, the evidence from Australia would have to be capable of being given in such a manner that it could be tested, cross-examined and accepted one way or the other.<br \/>Deputy Doherty asked how long it would take for that to occur.  I cannot say.  It would ultimately be a matter for advice.  Neither the current Law Society members nor I are predicting the outcome of any legal challenge.  We are not seeking to do so.  Clearly, it would be a matter of the evidence and legal arguments made at the time.  As the Minister for Health has indicated, he believes there is little doubt there will be a legal challenge.  Such a measure, being introduced for the first time in the northern hemisphere, namely, in the European Union, and the consequences if it were to be taken as a precedent elsewhere, would mean the stakes would be very high.  We could anticipate a legal challenge.  The concern of the Law Society has had is that intellectual property rights and their significance in this debate should not be lost or passed over on the basis of the understandable and overwhelming concern of members of a health committee for health issues.  It is natural that this should be the case but it should not submerge the proper consideration of the intellectual property rights issues that would form part of an assessment by a court.  As the president said in his opening statement, we in the Law Society were quite concerned that, somehow or other, we were being lumped together with, seen as apologists or Trojan horses for, or regarded as representative of the tobacco industry or tobacco interests.  That is not the case.  We are simply here because we believe intellectual property law is important, including for Ireland Inc.  The Law Society's submission would be pretty similar if the proposal were on foodstuffs, alcohol or some other measure.<\/p> <p>It is not specific to tobacco.

I emphasise at the outset that intellectual property and trademark rights are critical to this economy.  Of course it is of huge significance for such rights to be defended and vindicated.  International software companies have made huge investments in this country.  This area is of importance both in terms of inward investment and export.  The protection of intellectual property rights is a given.<\/p><p>  Would the witnesses not agree that there is an obligation on the State to vindicate the rights of its citizens by protecting their lives?

As responsible politicians, we certainly do not want to usurp or undermine trademarks and intellectual property rights, which are critical components of the commercial life of this country.  We must act in a manner that protects the lives of our citizens.  The first obligation of every state is to protect the lives of its citizens.  Clearly, we have a dichotomy or a debate in that regard.  I am quite definite that if we invited the witnesses into another room, or invited them in under another guise, they would have a different view.  Let us be honest - that is why they are professionally involved in this business.  I am not dismissing that.  I am pointing out the reality.  I would like the witnesses to provide a little context by referring to this committee's obligation to try to vindicate the health and life of citizens.

Why has the Law Society tried to come in on this constitutional right rather than the constitutional right we discussed last year in the context of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill?

Dr. Gietz of John Player &amp;amp; Sons Limited had a great deal to say earlier about intellectual property.  He referred to what a ruling like this could do to our reputation abroad in the context of the significant role foreign direct investment plays in Ireland.  We are not talking during this session about a benign industry.  We are talking about where one in two users die.  I may have been somewhat flippant when I said that one in two users of Facebook do not die, but I think it illustrates the point I am making.  I am trying to put this debate in context by emphasising that the primary objective of this committee is to protect the health of the Irish public.

I would not like it to be misinterpreted as something I am proposing.  The most severe measure the Oireachtas could take with regard to tobacco would be to ban it completely.  The reality is that this is a legal product, even if it does have terrible health consequences.  Balances are struck by the Oireachtas in terms of what is possible.  Of course it has to be subject to what is legally possible.  Ireland has very strong property rights in the Constitution.  They have not been tested in the context of a measure like that proposed in this instance.  I am not seeking to predict the outcome of it when I say it is certainly a concern.  I was taken by Deputy Kelleher's strong support for the maintenance of intellectual property rights.  I assure the committee that I am being jocose when I say that purely from the self-interest of the legal profession, we would be encouraging the Oireachtas to enact this legislation.  The amount of litigation work that would be made in courts everywhere would be enormous.<\/p><p>  I would like to return to the Chairman's question about the invitation that was made to the society with regard to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  As we said in our original submission, the Law Society has made approximately 20 submissions on legislation over recent years.  We do this all the time across a huge range of areas.  In addition, we get individual requests from Government Departments and we make submissions to them.  We get letters from Ministers looking for our views.  Generally speaking, our views are welcome and largely uncontroversial.  It is pretty unique for views expressed by a Law Society committee to be as controversial as these views have been.  They were not intended to be controversial.  Last year's Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill related to an area that is notoriously controversial and very divisive.  The society took the view that it could not take a public position on the matter in the absence of an internal debate within the profession, which would probably have been extremely divisive.  We had no mandate to take a position one way or another on the underlying issues in that legislation, which are deeply polarising.  That was unique, in my experience, because it was the first time the society declined to make a submission when invited to do so.  As far as I can recall, it was the only time this happened.  It is a unique issue, in many respects.  One might not agree with the view we took on the matter at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300019#U00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1392298800,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I asked about how would a case might be defended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021300019#U00800","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392298800,"counter":979,"content":"<p>We could not say that without knowing what evidence would be adduced.
