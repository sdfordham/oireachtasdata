There are important times ahead for Ireland and the European Union and this strong engagement remains vital.  Since our previous meeting, the United Kingdom formally indicated its intention to withdraw from the European Union and last week this committee met the British ambassador to discuss that matter.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of important issues to cover with the Minister of State, namely: the ongoing work of the General Affairs Council; how the Minister of State sees the key developments on the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union; the future of Europe, a strategically important issue for this committee that we will focus on in some of our future work; and the European semester process this week.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State to make his opening remarks on these four issues before a question-and-answer session.<br\/><br\/>Members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I welcome the opportunity to contribute and I thank the Chairman for his kind remarks just now and during last night's D&aacute;il debate on Brexit.  I will give an update on Brexit but I will comment on the future of Europe following the meeting to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.  This will be an important discussion for our country and the Oireachtas and this is the obvious forum to have some consideration in respect of that going forward.  I will also comment on the European semester, which was discussed at the General Affairs Council, GAC.  This is an ongoing process and, for example, the Minister for Finance will appear before the finance committee tomorrow to discuss it.<\/p> <p>  There has been a high-level activity on Brexit since I last engaged with the committee.  In the intervening period, the committee has been particularly active and not just in terms of engaging with Departments and meeting key interlocutors in Brussels.  The Chairman and Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey referred to their successful visit during yesterday's debate in the D&aacute;il.  The committee may have to make another visit.  Such visits are beneficial in the context of giving our opinion.  As they both stated in the Chamber, such visits also provide an opportunity for us to hear the concerns of other member states.  That has been a significant element of my visits throughout Europe, which have been interesting and beneficial.  The committee has also heard from other stakeholders, including the British ambassador.  I commend the Chairman and the committee on the important work they are undertaking.<\/p> <p>  The important milestone was the triggering - finally - of the Article 50 process by the British Prime Minister ,Theresa May, as she formally notified the European Council of the UK's intention to leave the EU.  The second milestone was the consequent circulation of draft EU negotiating guidelines by European Council President Donald Tusk to the 27 member states on Friday, 31 March.   These draft guidelines will provide the political framework for the negotiations and will be discussed by the EU 27 in the coming weeks.  They will be adopted following the GAC on Saturday, 29 April.  Both Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter of notification and the EU&rsquo;s draft negotiating guidelines represent a constructive starting point for the negotiations to follow.  From our perspective, we welcome the reaffirmation in the letter of the British Government's commitment to maintaining the common travel area and its stated objective of avoiding a return to a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  We are similarly pleased that the draft guidelines include a strong acknowledgement of Ireland's unique circumstances, the need to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and our intention to maintain strong bilateral arrangements, such as that relating to the common travel area, with the UK.  Helpful language on Ireland was included in a comprehensive resolution approved by the European Parliament on 5 April.  The committee's engagement with fellow parliamentarians was part of a national movement to have strong language included in all documents and credit must be given to the committee members and others.<\/p> <p>  More broadly, we are happy that both Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter and the draft EU guidelines are constructive in tone and show a pragmatic approach to key points, such as the need for transitional measures.  That will go a long way towards providing certainty for citizens and businesses alike.  It is also welcome that both the UK and the EU share the objective of having the closest future relationship and that discussions on this future relationship should begin in parallel with the exit negotiations.  We were keen in that regard but, in order for this to happen, sufficient progress should be made on citizens' rights, the UK&rsquo;s financial commitments and issues specific to the island of Ireland.  It is a significant achievement that our issues will complement the other issues.  We will continue to study the draft guidelines carefully.  Our Sherpas were in Brussels again yesterday and we will keep an eye on the issues unique to Ireland and to the many other issues that arise.<\/p> <p>  The draft guidelines will now be discussed throughout April and the objective is to have them adopted by the European Council on 29 April.  Presuming that the guidelines are adopted, negotiating directives will subsequently be prepared for the adoption by the Council.  I will attend this meeting in May.  One meeting is scheduled at the moment but that may not be the case.  The negotiating directives will provide a formal mandate for the Commission negotiating team led by Michel Barnier, whom the committee has met, and will authorise the opening of negotiations with the UK, which will start at the beginning of June.<\/p> <p>  We can be happy with the extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign of recent months.  There is understanding and recognition of our unique circumstances and specific issues, but this is the beginning of a long process and our work will continue.  The fact that we have made a good start should serve to encourage us but that does not mean we do not have a significant body of work to undertake.  We will continue our strategic engagement with EU partners, both in discussions among the EU 27 and bilaterally.<\/p><p>In the past nine months I have met 18 or 19 committees of member states that are similar to this one and their Governments and so forth last month.  Last week I visited Lithuania and had very useful discussions.  It was most interesting to hear their concerns about Brexit.  It was an opportunity for me to emphasise our shared areas of concern and, once again, to reinforce that elements of the UK's decision to pursue Brexit are unique to Ireland.  I have recently visited other countries such as Spain, Italy, Norway, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Greece and Romania.  Norway is not an EU country but it has specific concerns as a member of the European Economic Area, EEA.  We must continue negotiations into the future.  There is a year and a half left of the first phase of Brexit negotiations before the matter goes to the European Parliament.  It will play a role in due course. <br\/><br\/>I will touch on the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and the future of Europe.  As the committee will know, EU leaders met on Saturday, 25 March to mark the anniversary.  They adopted a declaration that highlighted the achievements of the past six decades and set out the main focus of the European Union's agenda for the future.  They committed to working towards four key aims: a safe and secure Europe; a prosperous and sustainable Europe; a social Europe; and a stronger Europe.  The Rome Declaration is timely and welcome.  It is a clear endorsement of the value and achievements of the European Union since its creation and a statement of determined unity of purpose that our future peace and prosperity is best preserved and promoted through the European Union.<br\/><br\/>As part of the Commission's contribution to the 60th anniversary, it presented a White Paper on the Future of Europe on 1 March.  In addition to setting out the main achievements of the European Union, it addresses the challenges that Europe is facing.  It presented five scenarios for how the Union could evolve by 2025, depending on how we, as Europeans, choose to respond.  The main thrust of the paper is an attempt to look at some of the options or different paths that the EU could take over the next decade.  The scenarios in the White Paper cover a range of possibilities.  They are not exhaustive.  While there are five options it is fair to say that they are not mutually exclusive.  The Commission will further contribute to the debate in the months to come with a series of reflection papers on the following topics: the development of the social dimension of Europe; the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union on the basis of the Five Presidents' report that was published in 2015; the harnessing of globalisation; the future of Europe's defence ; and the future of EU finances.  Current indications are that these further papers will be released before the summer break.  The White Paper has been presented as the beginning of the process, and not the end, with the intention of starting a wide-ranging debate between the Governments and, more importantly, the people of this continent on where our common future lies.  It will start by asking what is the level of ambition that we hold.  We welcome the publication of the White Paper.  It provides lots of food for thought.  It has set out a number of scenarios on how the EU might evolve in the period ahead.  It is a non-prescriptive approach and is presented as an initial contribution.  It is important that Ireland engages with this debate.  As I said at the beginning of this meeting, it seems to me, and not speaking on behalf of this committee, that the obvious place to discuss this matter is with this joint committee that represents Members of both D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>The final element that the Chairman asked me to discuss was the General Affairs Council, GAC, and the European Semester process.  The most recent meeting of the GAC took place on 7 March.  As is the case in advance of a European Council meeting, the main topic on the agenda was preparation for the European Council.  The Taoiseach has reported on this matter in the D&aacute;il and I spoke about it on the same occasion.<br\/><br\/>I will give a briefly report on the European Semester that was also on the agenda.  As members will know, the European Semester is the EU's annual cycle of economic policy guidance and surveillance.  Each year the European Commission analyses the fiscal and structural reform policies of every Member State, provides recommendations and monitors their implementation.  The aim is to create the conditions for more competitive and sustainable economies and social policies right across the European Union.  This guidance from the Commission assists member states in co-ordinating their economic policies in order that we can all benefit from a shared EU economic agenda.  It is important to note, the system enforces policies that we, as member states, have agreed to.  It is not a third person coming in and enforcing European Union rules.  These are rules that the Irish Government, and successive governments, have believed are in the best interests of all European Union citizens, collectively and individually.  Each semester starts with a publication in November by the Commission of the annual growth survey that identifies economic and social priorities for member states.  It concludes with the issuing of country-specific recommendations.  These recommendations are concrete, targeted and measurable.<br\/><br\/>As part of the process, the Commission publishes country reports in February that analyse each member state's economic and social policies.  Each  April, Ireland, like other member states, submits its national reform programme to the European Commission, in conjunction with a stability programme update.  Last week the committee received a copy of the national reform programme, NRP.  The NRP is prepared on a whole-of-Government basis.  It provides an overview of structural reforms and policy actions that are under way.  It sets out the policies being advanced in response to the issues raised by the European Commission in its country report on Ireland.  It responds to the country-specific recommendations addressed to Ireland as part of last year's semester process.  Some of the issues addressed include: the decision of the UK to leave the European Union; public finances and investment; labour market activation policies and child care; the sustainable resolution of non-performing loans, which is a long-standing issue now; housing supply and spatial planning; and cost effectiveness of the health care system.  We, as politicians, in these Houses are already aware that these are the burning issues that we must address.  The NRP also reports on progress towards our national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy that covers: employment; research and development; climate change and energy; education; and poverty reduction.  Stakeholder engagement is considered to be an important part of the process.  Input and views are welcomed from a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives of civil society and regional representatives.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Together with the stability programme update, the NRP helps to inform the Commission's approach to drafting country-specific recommendations for Ireland for the coming year.  We expect draft CSRs next month.  These policy recommendations are then discussed in the relevant Council formations and will be discussed at the European Council meeting in June.<\/p><p>I would be more than happy to brief the committee afterwards about the process and any other element of the country-specific recommendations and I am sure other Ministers and their the finance Departments will do likewise.  <\/p><p> Every time I am before this committee I apologise for the length of my intervention.  They are substantive issues and I thanks the committee for staying with me while I go through them.  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017041200002#B00200","speaker":"1282","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492002000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive overview.

It cannot be easy to find oneself in Latvia one day and in Greece the next, it is tough going.  When we visited Brussels, I was very impressed at the level of work being carried out by the ambassador and his team there.  The one down-side to the Minister of State's work and that of the ambassador is that not enough citizens in Ireland are aware of the level of work and commitment which has been put in by both offices in Europe.  We have to find a way to bring that message back home.  People are genuinely concerned about where we are going and that there is not a plan in place.  As things unfold, like any good game of poker, we begin to see more and more of the plan emerge.  Having seen some of the work close-up, I believe the Minister of State is putting his back into it and I wish there were more opportunities for it to be set out for the public.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned by a couple of issues.  The Minister of State cannot do much about one of them himself but I want to raise it.  Some 100,000 UK citizens living in Northern Ireland are excluded from the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement insofar as they cannot apply for a dual passport or Irish passport.  The reason is that they had moved from other parts of the world to Northern Ireland.  Many of these people have children who have dual passport entitlement.  As we progress through Brexit, we need to look at this question and address it.  Any opportunity I get to mention this, I do so.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of UK finances, not long ago a group from the House of Commons came before us.  We broached the subject of their living up to their 2020 commitments.  The view among a small number was that when they were gone, they were gone and their money was gone with them.  Can the Minister of State offer any enlightenment on this area from what he has heard on the other side?  <\/p> <p>  People are tired of hearing the terms of the soft and hard Border.  I believe that in the short time available to negotiate Brexit, 16-odd months, it is more likely to be a disorganised or disruptive Brexit rather than hard or soft.  There will be a lot of things that will have to be pushed out that cannot be dealt with in this short period.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's views on this.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to a strong Europe during his opening remarks .  If we have learned nothing else in recent months, it is that there is a cohort of people in Europe who are disaffected and becoming more and more so over time.  I am particularly concerned about young people.  When young people have nothing else to do, it is very easy to radicalise them.  Whatever comes forward in the new Europe, post-Brexit, must have policies that are not wishy-washy but that offer serious career opportunities to young people on the continent of Europe.  That fits into the area of the social dimension.  <\/p> <p>  It is possible to make all the plans in the world, but if it is something unpalatable we blame Europe.  This is part of what drove Brexit and we still have not learned that in this country.  We say that we were given a directive, we have to comply with European law.  In his opening statement, the Minister of State said that we negotiate.  We agree policy.  Has anyone thought of how we feed this down to the public, that the policies are agreed and it is not some type of Big Brother, looking over our shoulders and telling us what to do?<\/p> <p>    On health, I do not understand how I can go to Lanzarote and buy a year's worth of medication at a fraction of the cost of what I would pay in Ireland for exactly the same thing.  If we are talking about an integrated Europe and about the buying power of Europe, with the large pharmaceutical companies - we have just seen the debacle here over Orkambi - surely to God we must be able to negotiate central purchasing.  If we can do it for defence, why not for health?<\/p> <p>  I mentioned defence but I am concerned that we are focusing on defence and not policing.  There should be much closer co-operation of police forces throughout the European Union.  If anything, there should be a single European police force that feeds into the national police forces of every other country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017041200002#D00300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1492002000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for his presentation and bringing us up to date on developments in Europe.  I agree with Senator Craughwell and the Minister of State. There is a growing recognition across Europe about the pivotal nature of Brexit discussions, and the Irish authorities have played a significant role in informing our European colleagues about that.  We need to emphasise that again and again.  I was at a meeting recently where we were complimented for being the most eloquent in terms of informing our colleagues at all levels, in Parliament, the Commission, and with the chief negotiators and I compliment the Minister of State, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and others who each took their turn at working on this.  It is recognised and the sensitive nature of the Irish position is at the finger-tips of every person of influence in Europe.<\/p> <p>  We have to proceed in negotiations in a way that is to our benefit.  We did not cause this situation, it came upon us as a result of decision by a member state, which it is entitled to do.  However, there are consequences which remain to be seen.  It is essential that we reiterate what the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and various people in this room and in opposition have stated, that the island of Ireland is an entity and must be treated as such and that the island, North and South, retains all the benefits including the protection of the peace process and all that goes with it.  We need to retain all beneficial aspects that we have enjoyed, including the peace process from European membership.<\/p> <p>  Transitional measures have been mentioned.  I would warn against transitional measures being used to ease our thinking on matters that might be unpalatable to us in the future.  Those transitional measures should not be rugs that can later be pulled from under our feet, when it is too late to negotiate the main issues arising from Brexit.<\/p> <p>  I do not need to say this to the Minister of State, but we need to emphasise that it is vital we ensure that we continue to attract foreign direct investment to this country.  We must not be forced to impose taxes on profits that FDI firms in this jurisdiction make in other jurisdictions, along the lines of the proposal before the European courts.<\/p><p>The danger of something like that happening would be hugely detrimental to foreign direct investment in this country.  It would be far better for all foreign direct investment to go to whichever country it saw fit or chose, in the first instance.  For one European country to become the tax collector for moneys earned in other European countries in respect of any foreign direct investor would be a huge blow to the attractiveness of this jurisdiction as a location for investment.  I do not have to tell the Minister of State all of that but it would do no harm if he emphasised this to our European colleagues.  <\/p><p> The future of Europe is a hugely important issue.  Presumably, the intention is to address the issues that have been particular barbs over the past number of years.  I can never understand - I repeat what I have said in the past and it has been said by everybody else as well - why each member state feels it wishes to have more influence and as a result exert its influence on the European Union.  Somebody has missed the point somewhere along the route.  Each member state should have brought to the table a collection of measures to which each can subscribe and which can become part of the strength of the European Union, to which each member state can continue to subscribe.  That is not happening at present and has not happened over the past number of years.  Individual member states have poked holes in the European fabric.  They have sought to set themselves apart from the general direction in which Europe was supposed to be heading.  As a result, our next door neighbour has taken a route that it viewed as available.  Other member states are developing similar thoughts, a situation that will have consequences for us.  I hope that during the current debate on the future of Europe, it should address those issues with a view to ascertaining the extent to which each member state contributes to a package of measures to which they can subscribe and support.  As the previous speaker has said, going home afterwards and blaming the European Union for things that have not been to a member state's satisfaction is not the way to do things and we will not have such a Europe.<\/p><p> Ireland's geographic position in terms of isolation from the centre of Europe must be borne in mind.  Each remaining member state must recognise that Ireland, as importers or exporters, is unable to drive across Europe to deliver or collect goods.  We can only remedy the situation by establishing new transit routes.  We will continue to be members of the European Union after Brexit.  We will negotiate in the current climate as members of the European Union.  We should use all of that to good effect to ensure that we are not part of the swings and roundabouts that are convenient for other countries but where we pay the price.  I do not think we will and I hope we will not pay the price.<\/p><p> Energy and climate change are focal issues in the discussion on the future of Europe.  It is hugely important that Ireland maintains a strong position on the area for many reasons, such as the substitution of imports and so on.  <\/p><p> One of my criticisms of Europe over the past number of years surfaced when some member states felt that they should unilaterally take a decision on, for example, the refugee crisis.  Why should one or more members states decide they cannot accept refugees?  I refer especially to those member states that are located in areas that have a considerable historical experience of refugees.  I mean in the context that they should and could be quick to recognise the plight of refugees.  The saddest element is the barbed-wire response, which must never happen again.  It was a blight on Europe.  We were able to see the iconic vision of razor wire to greet children who were on the run from something over which they had no control.  The fact that nothing happened when an individual or individual member states took that route was a weakness in the cohesive image of Europe.  It was a huge drawback in terms of achieving what we all need to achieve and thought we were part of.  I am not directly criticising the countries that shall remain nameless but are well known to us all.  Those countries should have felt that the European Union as a whole would have supported them in the location, treatment and protection of refugees.  There should not have been a departure from unity throughout the European Union on those issues.  Razor wire was a sad sight to see and the image has been broadcast all over the world.  It is not a great advertisement for Europe.  I am annoyed the most when some spokespersons in individual members states in the Union try to justify the situation.  There is no justification for such images, there should never be and they should never be accepted.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017041200002#D00400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492002000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, his officials and the diplomatic corps for attending.

Roughly 30,000 people live on the peninsula of Gibraltar that is located at the tip of Spain.  Ireland did not negotiate a veto on Brexit and negotiations even though we have a 499 km Border with the United Kingdom that also acts as a border with the European Union and the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  Ireland will be the greatest loser in the Brexit negotiations because &euro;1.2 billion worth of trade is done on a weekly basis between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Why did Ireland not demand a veto?  Surely the situation cannot be decided by a simple majority of the 27 countries.  They cannot decide to damage our economy, destroy our jobs and destroy our exports to the United Kingdom.  We must take whatever action is required before agreement is reached.  We must let Europe know that Ireland will not stand idly by.  We must take this matter very seriously.  Ireland should demand a veto and, if not, we must filibuster.  As far as I am concerned, there can be no agreement without agreement by the Irish Government and Irish people.  If this matter must be decided by a referendum then so be it.  If that is the ultimate decision then let that be the case.  If this matter must go to the people then so be it because I trust their judgment on a negotiated deal.  If the deal is not up to standard then Ireland must reconsider its position.  A hard border will destroy the beef trade and farming in Ireland.  I wish to put down a marker that Ireland must be at its toughest.  The current negotiations will be tougher than the ones that took place for the Good Friday Agreement and the Downing Street negotiations in the 1920s.

We can all do ongoing work because it is a space in which we do not have disagreement about what we want to achieve for our island.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised a specific issue about the difficulties facing the 100,000 UK citizens living in Northern Ireland who have dual citizenship.  Issues pertaining to UK citizens are matters for the United Kingdom Government but they will be addressed in the round one discussions on acquired rights and citizens' entitlements.  My hope is that, as discussions evolve, there will be reciprocity and European Union citizens will be treated in the United Kingdom in a similar fashion to how United Kingdom citizens are treated in the European Union, which will cover the 100,000 citizens referred to by the Senator.<\/p> <p>  The second and third key areas to be discussed in round one will be costs and financial commitments, which have been the subject of statements by some UK politicians though not, of late, by Government Ministers.  We have to restate that this is not a fine, levied on the good people of the UK for leaving, but relates to pre-existing commitments that have been signed up to.  I hope work will continue on the methodology of how we define how the commitments were entered into and, after it has been agreed, a figure will be arrived at.  This will be a fair and transparent way of dealing with the issue.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell talked about youth.  It is true that the younger one is, the less one is aware of the many crises there have been all over the Continent, including on this island.  The peace dividend on the Continent is less evident to young people and we must continue to demonstrate to them that Europe is a force for good in areas of security and prosperity.  In the UK referendum, however, younger people were more pro-EU than their older neighbours and family members.  The Senator also made a point, which was followed up on by Deputy Durkan, Senator Leyden and others, about blaming Europe for the rules.  Nobody should believe the European Union is perfect as it is far from perfect but one of the most distressing parts of the UK referendum was the constant reference to it in the third person, as \"them\", \"technocrats\" or \"those Europeans\".  Every decision that affects us, including the European semester which we have today and the so-called rules, was agreed by Irish Ministers, British Ministers, German Ministers, etc.  They can cause difficulty, burden and disagreement subsequently but they are our rules.  If we do not like them, we should try to change them and we should use a collective term when we talk about the European Union.  It is \"our\" union and they are \"our\" policies.<\/p> <p>  Drugs, health and pharmaceutical spending is looked at in the context of a semester and a new framework agreement between the State and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, was agreed last July which will deliver savings of some &euro;600 million over the next four years.  There is also scope to extend the agreement.  The Senator also asked about police co-operation, which is developing and strengthening through the justice and home affairs arrangements.  Europol is undertaking extensive work, such as with the European arrest warrant which is now very successful.  In the face of terrorist attacks, further and deeper co-operation among police forces is absolutely vital and we are in the process of signing up to the Schengen information system.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about foreign direct investment into Ireland, which is of crucial importance.  It is vital that we work together as a country, given the challenges that our neighbours have set us and which we did not want.  We must continue to maximise foreign direct investment into our country, not to be punitive or exploit any difficulties anyone else has but because it is clearly in our national interest.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned tax.  While there is an ongoing court case involving a historic issue there are no proposals to change the rules surrounding how taxes are determined.  This is a national competence and we are not changing our tax policy.  Tax is only a part of the suite of measures with which Ireland presents itself as a good country in which to invest.<\/p><p>We have had the same policy with respect to taxation for 40 to 50 years.  It is the quality of our workforce, the certainty of our membership of the European Union, our membership of the currency, the fact that we speak English and are a hard working, competitive economy that attracts inward investment.  We must work to ensure that continues.  In regard to our geographic status, isolation and access to European markets, as stated yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Ross, during the Brexit debate we will have to review how we access European Union markets as the negotiations continue.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of climate change with respect to the future of Europe, the climate change issue goes far beyond the future of Europe from a political perspective.  It is also a key point with respect to the future of our planet.  On the guidelines and the reference to Spain, it is important to clarify that there is a specific section in the guidelines that deals with Ireland and the common travel area.  The guidelines also reference the Good Friday Agreement.  The only reference in the guidelines to the word &quot;unique&quot; is in reference to the issues pertaining to Ireland.  This was extremely important to us.  There are many other parts of the Continent where there are issues around territory, nationality and so on, but we wanted the issues around Ireland to be separate, distinct and unique, and they are.  We very much welcome this.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the talks and how decisions will be taken, it is important to clarify the issue of a Spanish veto.  When it comes to the new arrangement, which will discussed in the second round, every member state will have the potential to block it but the decision will have to be a unanimous one.  It is within the confines and the context of the new relationship that the issue of Spain and Gibraltar will pertain.  One could make the case it already will have a veto in any event.  These issues will not be discussed in round one, which is where the qualified majority voting element will come into play.  The issues about Spain and Gibraltar are different from the issues surrounding the island of Ireland, the common travel area and the peace process.  We already have an agreement with Britain in the form of the Good Friday Agreement.  That agreement addresses some of the crucial elements, including, for example, if the people of Northern Ireland through a referendum vote for a united Ireland, how that process will take place.  In the context of the negotiations, we are adamant that nothing can happen to remove that.  If in the future the people of Ireland vote for a united Ireland, Northern Ireland will then return to the European Union, as was the case with respect to east Germany joining Germany.  Not only are these separate issues involving different parts of the European Union, they are issues that are at different stages of discussion.  We have agreed the process with the British.  People on both sides of the island have voted on it and the process is clear.<br\/><br\/>When it comes to the common travel area and Ireland's relationship with the UK, we do not want change.  We have a legally binding agreement that cannot be changed even by a vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  For example, we cannot request that the status of Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom, or within the European Union independently, be changed.  As I said, these issues are separate and it is vital that they remain so.  In terms of the statements from the United Kingdom Government, the Commission and the Parliament and everything that has been said around this table, in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad, we agree on the principles around the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area.  Unfortunately, in other parts of the European Union they do not agree.  We want this to be incubated within the talks.  We want to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  For this reason, the language in terms of what different countries have looked for within the guidelines is different.<br\/><br\/>On the question of whether we are looking for changes in the guidelines, we are not.  The text in the guidelines is text proposed by Ireland.  The negotiating position on the section pertaining to Ireland, which is now European Union policy, started as Irish policy.  That is why we welcome it.  I accept that in terms of how we maintain the common travel area, give effect to maintenance of the peace process and ensure we have the softest possible Border in the context of Brexit, the devil will be in the detail.  We will have to work through all of that, including with this committee.<br\/><br\/>On Deputy Haughey's question regarding the future of Europe, the position of other member states and how many positions there might be, I get the sense that in many member states there are different levels of ambition politically.  This was evidenced in some of the high level commentary we have heard from Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande.  We must accept in the context of the European Union that member states will move forward at different paces and at different times.  This is already the case.  The Irish public has expressed strong pro-European sentiment in opinion polls, yet we are party to certain measures and not to others.  For example, we are not in Schengen but we are in the currency.  My own view is that we should move forward in co-operation at a pace that is suitable to our country and allows others to do the same within the overall strong framework of the 27 member states supported by other close groupings, including the European Economic Area and, in the future, our close neighbour, the United Kingdom.<br\/><br\/>I hope I have responded to all of the questions raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017041200002#F00200","speaker":"1282","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492002000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the Minister of State for his engagement here today.

Section 1(2) of the Bill sets out the standard commencement provisions for the Bill, providing that the Minister may bring into operation the provisions in the Bill when enacted by way of an order or orders on specified days.  Amendment No. 2 amends this subsection to provide for the commencement of certain provisions on the passing of the Bill.  The relevant provisions in this regard relate primarily to minor technical amendments proposed to the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 which I will propose later.  Amendment No. 2 also amends the typographical error making reference to &quot;Part 14&quot; of the Bill, which should be corrected to refer to Part 4 of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Regarding Opposition amendment No. 107, the Long Title of this Bill provides that it relates to an Act, <i>inter alia<\/i>, &quot;to make miscellaneous and consequential amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to various other Acts in so far as they relate to planning and development&quot;.  In this regard, section 1 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provides the standard provisions for the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement of that Act.  In the context of the collective citation, section 1 of that Act provides that the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2015 and the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 may be cited together as the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2016 and shall be construed together as one.  Therefore, the Long Title of the Bill under discussion only provides for amendments to those provisions of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 that relate to planning and development and not to any of the provisions of the 2016 Act relating to residential tenancies.  For this reason, I oppose the amendment by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  Any amendments to the provisions of the 2006 Act relating to residential tenancies are not appropriate to this Bill as they do not relate to planning and development, the principal focus of this Bill, and should instead be made by way of amendment to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#A00600","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Do any members have questions on these amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#B00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I will make a general opening comment that has nothing to do with what the Minister just outlined.

As I stated on Second Stage, we support the establishment of the planning regulator.  It is a very important addition to our planning architecture and was strongly recommended by the tribunal.  However, it is really important that we have a body that is not just consultative and that does not just evaluate and assess while the power to act rests in the main with the Minister.  If a regulator is to really add value to the planning system, it has to have some independent ability to act.<\/p> <p>  I do not anticipate that the Minister will accept my amendments in this section or others.  I am not going to try to convince him of their merits.  I only ask him to go away and think, between now and Report Stage, about what the Government could do to give additional powers to the regulator.  In whatever areas the Department thinks are appropriate, it is my view that the regulator should not simply be making suggestions to the Minister, which is essentially what the Act recommends, but that it should have powers to make binding determinations, or the ability to intervene independently of Government.<\/p> <p>  My fear is that, without provision for such a scope of action, we will have a toothless tiger and that is not what the Mahon tribunal recommended.  I made the point on Second Stage that one of the tribunal's related recommendations highlighted the need to shift power away from the Minister and the Department.  The concern that I and other planning commentators have is that the Bill seems to move in the opposite direction.  I think that is a real fundamental flaw.  I am not seeking to make politics.  We are going to support this Bill whatever its final shape.  However, I do think there is more work to be done.  In proposing amendments Nos. 6 to 11, inclusive, I am raising these issues and urge the Minister to consider how he might act.  <\/p> <p>  I am not clear from the functions of office as outlined on page 7 whether, for example, in addition to carrying out investigations and evaluations of planning authorities and decisions, the office of the regulator could do the same with the Minister or the Department.  I think that would also be a very important function, not that I am at all suggesting that the current Minister or any of his officials need to undergo planning-related investigations.  It would strengthen the regulator's independence if it had that additional function of holding the Minister and the Department to account in certain defined areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#C01500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>We also believe this Bill is a badly needed and welcome development in our planning architecture.  There is a subtle line between having too much power going out of a Department, losing in-house capability, and having too much power remain there.

The overall approach is right and we need to get the legislation right.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 14 is in our mind just a drafting amendment.  We thought it improved the wording.  Amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 15 are similar to each other in nature.  One of the ways in which our planning system is currently very mixed and variable is the application of Part VIII.  Some authorities apply it in a very appropriate and proper manner while others use it as a short cut, according to a number of commentators.<\/p><p>The purpose of amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 15 is to provide oversight of how the Part VIII system works.  There are other ways in which it could be improved in terms of what type of reporting of information should take place, but that is one of the intentions.  It was the Mullaghmore decision that first changed the entire system where the State had to comply with the law.  In some local authorities the Part VIII system is still used as a means whereby the State can in some ways bypass the law slightly.  The amendments seek to strengthen the performance and application of Part VIII by giving the regulator a clear direction to review it.  That is the intent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#C01600","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I agree that it is a good Bill.  It provides for the appointment of a planning regulator, which makes a great deal of sense.  The weakness is not so much that the Minister has too much power but that councillors and elected members have too much power in the planning process, particularly regarding planning recommendations.  I appreciate the difference between the powers of elected members in making a development plan as a reserved function and the power of officials, but I believe the abuse is where officials are often over-ruled and new development plans are put in place which bear no relationship to professional planning needs or advice.  That is where my concern is.  Historically, going back to the days of the late former Minister, James Tully, and so forth, a great deal of on-the-foot planning took place.  I am not blaming the former Minister, James Tully, who represented part of my constituency.  I know members of his family.  Planning has changed significantly over the years but the wrong that has been done and the communities that have been disadvantaged are the result not of ministerial powers in the planning system but as a direct result of councillors over-ruling planners and insisting on developments which should never be there in the first place.  They are now in place with all the consequent unreasonable demands that go with that, including pressure on services which should never occur.<\/p> <p>  Out of town shopping centres are a major example.  They do not make planning sense yet they mushroomed everywhere.  The only people who benefited in my view were the developers, not the communities.  In terms of joined-up planning, particularly with regard to transport links between significant shopping developments and communities, there is a huge in-built disadvantage with those out of town shopping centres particularly for people who do not have a car and where there is no proper public transport in place.  They have contributed significantly to the death of our urban town centres which, in many cases, are derelict and destroyed.  Bad planning and the powers of elected members in the planning process have helped destroy those town centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#D00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Hopefully, those days are behind us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#D00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I will make a general comment before going through the individual amendments.  A judgment call is required here in what we are trying to do as regards where the buck should stop on decisions to intervene to correct an inappropriate decision or to respond to corruption, although if it is a breach of the law it should involve the Garda.  Ultimately, we are proposing in the Bill that the office of the planning regulator would essentially assess the procedure by which decisions are made, be it in respect of county development plans, local development plans, planning decisions and so forth.  Before a county development plan is signed off on it will have to go to the planning regulator's office for a full assessment.  If there are concerns in that regard, whether they are procedural concerns or decisions or the regulator believes that the local area plans or county development plans are not consistent with national policy or good planning practice, the regulator will report that to the Minister who will have to take action on it.<\/p><p>What appears to be under discussion here is who will be the appropriate body or person to make the intervention to correct a wrong.  Should it be the Minister or the independent regulator?  There is nothing to suggest that an office of planning regulation is beyond corruption or inappropriate decisions.  At least a Minister is in the public eye and has a mandate from the people to be there.  The Minister must respond in a very transparent way and if a Minister is not going to accept the recommendation of the new regulator's office, he or she will have to publish the reasons for that and will be questioned on it in the D&aacute;il.  None of that accountability applies to a regulator's office.  Most people will never see the regulator or even know the names of the people who are making the determinations or decisions.  If people persuade me otherwise, we will go in a different direction.  This is not an absolute position.  However, we have had a long discussion on this in the Department.  Most of our team agree that the person who ultimately should be accountable here is a Minister with responsibility for planning.  If that person decides they will ignore the advice of a planning regulator's office, they had better be damned sure they have a good reason to explain why they have not intervened.<\/p><p>In some ways that is a more transparent and accountable process.  We all know what happens to Ministers who do not act in the way they should.  They are put under huge pressure.  The spotlight is on them and they must answer for their actions.  Regulators have nothing like that level of scrutiny regarding the decisions they make.  They never will have it, because that is the way our system works.  The functions of the regulator's office are:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;(a) to evaluate and assess&mdash;(i) development plans, including draft development plans,<br \/><br \/>(ii) variations of development plans, including proposed variations,<br \/><br \/>(iii) local area plans, including the amendment or revocation of such plans, and<br \/><br \/>(iv) regional spatial and economic strategies, ...(b) in respect of any plan or strategy to which paragraph (a) relates, to inform the Minister if, in the opinion of the Office, any such plan or strategy is not consistent with its observations and recommendations, especially where, in its opinion, failure to be so consistent would affect the overall strategy for proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned...&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>Subsection (e) provides &quot;to conduct reviews under Chapter IV of the performance by the Board and by planning authorities of their respective functions,&quot; while subsection (f) provides:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;to oversee the delivery of effective planning services to the public by planning authorities including having regard to&mdash;(i) any relevant indicator (within the meaning of Part 12A of the Local Government Act 2001) identified by the National Oversight and Audit Commission or prescribed by the Minister under section 126C(1) of that Act, or ...&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>The Bill also provides that the office shall conduct, at such intervals as it thinks fit or as the Minister directs, reviews of its organisation and the systems and procedures used by it in respect of the performance of its functions.<\/p><p>We are trying to ensure that professional planners in a regulator's office are assessing and reviewing all of the decisions around the country, the type of decisions Deputy O'Dowd refers to as being potentially undermined in the past.  The regulator raises a red flag and says, for example, that there is something happening in Cork that should not be happening.  The regulator sends that to the Minister and the Minister has a responsibility to act on it in a public and transparent way, having to account for their decisions before committees such as this or on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  If we were to decide not to go down that route and to provide that the regulator has the power to intervene and force a change in the decision, who questions the regulator and holds them to account in terms of consistency with national policy?<\/p><p>If, for example, we have a housing crisis and local authorities make a decision in using initiative or emergency powers to try to get the provision of local authority housing moving faster than it otherwise might be through the normal system, is that justified or not?  Sometimes there are political or policy considerations that can be explained or justified by a Minister, but they need to be tested through debate and discussion, which cannot be done with a regulator.  The regulator will produce an annual report that I presume will be discussed by this committee in terms of its assessment and decisions. <\/p><p> I am open to being convinced that we should move in a different direction, but my view is that the buck should stop with somebody who is accountable, has been elected to do a job and is available in a very transparent way to justify decisions.  That is the way in which we will most effectively achieve accountability in the eyes of the public.  I do not subscribe to the view that the political system cannot be trusted and that, therefore, we need to set up independent regulators to take all decisions in the implementation of policy.  Instead, let us have a much more transparent political system that forces Ministers to stand over their decisions under questioning under the spotlight by both the media and the Opposition.  For me, that is the way to deal with planning irregularities because we have seen, unfortunately, that senior officials, as well as public representatives, have been corrupted by the system.  It is not just politicians who have made bad decisions, not by a long shot.  What we are proposing is the right balance, but I have an open mind on the issue.  We should not be ignoring the responsibilities and accountability that should come with holding ministerial office which is ultimately where the buck should stop.  <\/p><p> I will address amendments Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive.  I oppose these five amendments which primarily propose the making of legally binding determinations by the OPR.  The role of the Office of the Planning Regulator is to evaluate and assess development plans and regional strategies and make statutory observations and recommendations on them.  It is not necessary to amend the Bill to give the OPR the power to make legally binding determinations.  The Bill provides that the OPR will be independent in carrying out its functions.  It also provides the OPR with sufficient powers to make recommendations to planning authorities and regional assemblies on local area plans, development plans and regional strategies and for these recommendations to have sufficient weight.  The OPR can submit observations or recommendations to the relevant planning authority on draft plans and strategies.  It would be extraordinary if a local authority did not act on the recommendations of the planning regulator.  It would signal that the next step of the planning regulator would be, essentially, to inform the Minister that there was something untoward because they had warned the local authority which did not take their advice and that the Minister needed to do something about it.  It will happen because sometimes local authorities take a stubborn stand on something.  We see this at the moment where the Minister needs to intervene to change county development and local area plans.  We have done it a number of times this year.  I am not very popular with local councillors when I do it, but it is the right thing to do to ensure good planning.  This is an independent office making that judgment and observation early and most local authorities will respond to it.  A planning authority is then required to notify the OPR and state the reasons why its plan has been made in such a manner as to be inconsistent with OPR observations and recommendations.  The information on the to-ing and fro-ing around notification and justification and so on will be publicly available.  Where the OPR is subsequently of the opinion that the development plan or regional strategies made by the relevant planning authority do not set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area or region concerned, it shall recommend the use of a ministerial direction for the plan to be revised and submit a draft direction to the Minister for issue to the planning authority or regional assembly concerned.  A copy of the notice submitted to the Minister shall be made available on the website of the OPR.  The Bill further provides that where the Minister agrees with the recommendation of the OPR on a plan or strategy, he or she will issue a direction to the relevant local authority or regional assembly.  The Bill sets out the detailed procedures that should then ensue.  <\/p><p> To a certain extent, the OPR is taking over a function currently carried out by the chief planner in the Department.  For example, I might get a file on my desk stating there is something happening in Kildare with which the OPR does not agree and outlining the reasons the Minister should intervene and disallow it.  We do that.  The local authority will then come back with a further justification or an acceptance of the ruling.  The next step for me is to either confirm that the ruling should stand or to put in place an independent inspector to verify whether the planning considerations on which we have ruled are sound.  We have done that in one or two cases.  It is about introducing a more substantial body to intervene and make recommendations.  It will have a lot of credibility and ensure the correspondence and interaction will happen in a very transparent way.  If a journalist is into planning, he or she can follow the way the decisions are being considered and finalised in a way that is very healthy.  The tooth of the tiger description is not accurate.  I can understand the point the Deputy is making, but there is a lot in this which will expose the decision-making process to the public for real public scrutiny which is very positive.  If the Minister does not agree with the recommendation of the OPR, the Bill provides that he or she is required to explain the reasons for such disagreement.  The Minister must lay the reasons for such disagreement before the Houses of the Oireachtas and also publish them on the Department's website.  These provisions will ensure the recommendations of the OPR are given due weight in the preparation of local area plans, development plans and regional spatial and economic strategies and that the procedures will be conducted in an open and transparent manner.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments.  <\/p><p> I do not propose to accept amendment No. 11 as there must be clear lines of demarcation between the role of the OPR and other responsible bodies, particularly in investigating possible corruption in decision-making in planning.  In instances where there is evidence of planning corruption or breaches of the law, they are strictly for investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Bill already has includes sufficient provisions for the investigation of complaints by the OPR and ensures they can, where appropriate, be deferred to more appropriate State authorities.  It further provides that the OPR may, at its own behest, at the request of the Minister or on foot of a complaint received, carry out reviews and examinations to determine if a planning authority is properly carrying out its functions under the planning Acts.  The Bill also allows the OPR to form its own opinion on complaints and make recommendations, as appropriate, to planning authorities and the Minister.  Furthermore, it provides that, with regard to complaints made by any person to the OPR on a planning matter, the OPR can, where it considers it to be warranted, refer the matter and related documents to the Ombudsman, the Standards in Public Office Commission, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other State authority, as may be prescribed.  The Bill further requires that information, records or documents be made available to the OPR or an authorised person appointed by him or her as part of any review or examination and that a planning authority or the board and its staff comply with any request for information or records and that they co-operate with the OPR in this regard.<\/p><p>Any person who obstructs or refuses to comply with the request of the OPR or an authorised person commits an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to specific penalties.  Accordingly, there are sufficient checks and balances built into the provisions for the conducting of investigations into planning corruption.  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.<\/p><p> With regard to amendments Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, which seek to enhance planning enforcement, I am opposed to the amendments with the exception of amendment No. 14.  In addition to evaluating and assessing local area plans, developments plans and regional spatial and economic strategies, one of the key roles of the OPR, as provided for in the Bill, will be to undertake reviews of the organisation, systems and procedures used by planning authorities in the performance of their functions under the planning Acts.  These functions include planning enforcement.  In situations where a sufficient number of complaints is received by the OPR about planning enforcement by a planning authority, there is scope within the provisions of the Bill, as drafted, for the OPR to review the organisation, systems and procedures used by the authority in respect of its enforcement functions under the planning Acts.  In effect, while planning authorities will still retain primary responsibility for planning enforcement, where there are potential issues about the organisation, systems and procedures used by a planning authority in the performance of its enforcement functions arising from complaints received, there is scope for the OPR to examine the matter.  This is considered to be the most pragmatic approach to adopt.  I do not favour the OPR being empowered to investigate individual planning complaints.  Otherwise, it is likely that the Office of the Planning Regulator would be inundated with such complaints, thereby undermining its ability to effectively perform its core and primary functions.  <\/p><p> We have to have some faith in the processes for determining planning decisions.  We have an appeals process and so on.  If there are procedural flaws in it and complaints coming in in that respect, the planning regulator will have the power to raise these issues.  He or she can refer them on to an appropriate body or inform the Minister that something is wrong.  If a planning department in a local authority has been corrupted, there will be an opportunity for the OPR to raise a red flag.  I am not sure the planning regulator should essentially be a second appeals body for planning decisions.  We would then end up with people using the office as a way of delaying the granting of planning permission.  <\/p><p> On the broader issue of corruption in the State, my personal view is that we need to look at new structures to deal with whistleblowers and how they are dealt with.  The way it works is overly political and results in Ministers having to take almost personal responsibility for whistleblowers' complaints.  We need to look at what works elsewhere.  Perhaps we might need to look at some new structures for how complaints of corruption, in State bodies in particular, can be dealt with in a way that is efficient and does not get caught up in political accusations and to-ing and fro-ing and so on but actually gets to the core of the issues a lot faster.  That is for another day, but I do not think we should allow the new Office of the Planning Regulator to get caught up in that stuff.  There are other ways we can do it.  Accordingly, as stated, I am opposing the amendments with the exception of amendment No. 14 which I can accept as its wording is consistent with the wording of section 31Q.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#D00400","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the detailed responses.

Let me try to persuade him a little in response to his comments.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely accept that the buck stops with the Minister for legislation and policy on planning matters.  No one here is suggesting those legislative or policy functions should be transferred outside the political process.  I also agree that we need a much more transparent political decision-making process, but giving stronger powers to a regulator to ensure enforcement and compliance not only by planning authorities and the board but also by the Minister and the Department within the context of legislation and policy set by the Government and holding Ministers and the Government to account are not mutually exclusive.  In fact, they can be mutually complementary.  <\/p> <p>  It is not the case that people do not know who the regulators are.  For example, Patrick Honohan, Philip Lane and the debates on the regulatory functions of the Central Bank have shown very clearly, albeit in a different context because the Governor of the Central Bank has a policy formulation role, that there can be very robust interactions in the public arena, of which people are publicly aware, between a regulator, a Minister and the Oireachtas.  Where there are disagreements, they are aired at committees and in the chambers.  While I can be very critical of the nature of the Central Bank and some of its decisions, the debate on the issue of the mortgage lending rules has shown very clearly the value of having independent regulatory functions with stronger powers than for what the Minister is providing.  Again, I am not proposing that we give the planning regulator policy-making powers, but I think ensuring compliance at all levels of planning authorities - political and official - is a very important function that it should have.  <\/p> <p>  In some senses the Minister described it quite well when he compared the planning regulator to being a little like the chief planner in the Department.  Clearly, this is a souped-up version of it.  It has a greater number of staff and more clearly defined functions, but essentially it is doing something that is already doable within the Department, albeit in a more limited form.  That is precisely the difficulty.  That is why it is not in compliance with the key recommendations of the Mahon tribunal and we are urging the Minister to go further.  He has said, for example, that if people are breaking the law, it is a legal matter.  We have a very poor history in this state of holding individuals to account within the legal, judicial and criminal processes - whether they be politicians or planners - who were involved in corrupt, inappropriate or negligent planning decisions that destroyed the lives not just of individuals but whole communities.  We have a very poor track record in that respect.  We set up tribunals which meet for lengthy periods of time.  They make recommendations, yet here we are not taking into account the key recommendation of the Mahon tribunal that there be a stronger regulatory body with independent powers moving from the Minister and the Department to the regulator.  Not only do we not prosecute people, but once again we are in a situation where we are not fully implementing the recommendations of a tribunal rightly set up by a Government to tackle some of these issues.<\/p> <p>  These are the questions the Minister needs to answer if he is to continue with the more limited form of office of the planning regulator he is outlining.  What happens if he refuses to take action?  Great, the regulator will have to publish an opinion.  That will not necessarily go anywhere or solve the problem.  While it might create a little fuss in the media for a few days and those directly implicated might be able to access that opinion, it will not solve the problem.  What if the Minister or departmental officials are implicated in the problem, either directly or because of inaction?  Again, I am not in any way suggesting that is the case, but where is the regulatory enforcement to tackle that issue?  The Minister is right - Ministers are in the public eye, but, again, we have a long history in this country of re-electing people to office, including to very high office, who are either accused of, or have been found guilty by tribunals of, corruption, malpractice, negligence and making bad decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#F00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I know that Deputy is being cautious, but I remind him not to mention names.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#F00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I will not name anybody or any local authority.  The Chairman should not worry.  I am just making the point that being in the public eye does not necessarily produce good quality outcomes in terms of planning decisions.  The Central Bank is a good example of a regulator that is publicly known and the interventions of which lead to good public debate, but we should also look at the Environmental Protection Agency.<\/p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency has independent enforcement action powers.  Nobody - probably none of us in this room, bar the Minister and his officials - could tell us who the head of the EPA is but we all know that the EPA takes decisive action when there are breaches of environmental regulations or contracts.  It is a different context, but it shows the value of having independent enforcement powers in addition to the Minister.  Who holds the Minister and the Department to account in all of these matters?<\/p><p> I agree with the Minister that the office of the planning regulator should not be a second appeals body.  I agree with him in respect of that because that would simply provide a way for those trying to slow down planning decisions.  In other areas where there is an appeals process within a particular decision-making process, for example, the appeals office in the Department of Social Protection which is independent, even when an appeal is concluded, appellants have the right to go to the Ombudsman which does not delay the decision but is a final check to ensure that there were no irregularities in the decision-making process.  There is no reason the Minister could not design a mechanism for persons, whether for members of the public or whistleblowers within the planning process, to be able to make complaints but, just like with the Ombudsman where there is a strict screening criteria which is not to review the substantive decision but to see if there were irregularities in the process of making the decision, one could ensure that it would not become, as the Minister rightly states, a second appeals body to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p> There are compelling arguments - the Mahon tribunal recommendations reinforce this - why the Minister should review this issue.  The Minister can do so without undermining any of the salient points he made in terms of the need for greater transparency in the political process and the authority of the Minister and the Government to set policy and legislation.  The strongest argument is the tribunal was set up, it made a recommendation but this is not what was recommended; I have yet to hear the Minister explain why that recommendation should not be implemented in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#F00600","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I will be fairly brief.  It is vitally important that we have a balance here.  It is critical to maintain democratic control over the process, and with that, political accountability.<\/p> <p>  We are in a different place today than we were a few decades ago.  I have been through three county development plans and several local area plans during that period and there has been significant change from my first one, in 2004, to the current one that was adopted last year.  We have seen, even in the past four to six years, the Minister's intervention in the county development plans has been ramped up significantly compared to what it was on the first plan in which I was involved.<\/p> <p>  On transparency, a lot of what has been recommended in this Bill is already in place, in my local authority and maybe some other local authorities, in terms of following exactly how decisions are made.  From the start of expressions of interest in the preparation of a draft plan right through to the final adoption of a draft plan, every aspect is now available on the website.  Anybody can go in and look at any stage at what decisions were made, when they were made, who made them and who proposed them.  We must acknowledge that we are in a different place today than where we were some time ago.<\/p> <p>  It is vital that we keep democratic control and political accountability.  Those are two vital pillars.  The planning regulator adds another layer of scrutiny to plans before they are finally adopted on top of what we already have and I would be comfortable and confident enough that there is enough oversight in what is being proposed here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#G00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I will respond, in particular, to some of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's comments.<\/p> <p>  I made the comparison with a beefed up chief planner's office in the Department.  That is in the context of the recommendation for a Minister to intervene in terms of a local area plan or whatever.  We have had this discussion in the Department.  The question has been put to me: \"What if one gets a pig-headed Minister who says that councillors in this area have made this decision, we should respect that, and he or she is not accepting their recommendation?\"  There is the potential for a Minister to do that and to ignore officials' advice, and for that not to be exposed publicly because the interaction between a Minister and his or her officials is not always subject to FOI as it is often in form of conversations in meetings.  A Minister has the power to be able to say: \"Do not put that in writing.  I am not accepting it.  We are moving on here.  Nothing to see.\"  That would be totally inappropriate but possible under the current system.<\/p> <p>  The difference here is that we have an independent office of planning regulator that is making an assessment that there is something inappropriate here, that is publishing that, and that has made that judgment and sent it back to the local authority stating that in the office's view, the local authority has made an inappropriate decision and should do something about it, and that is publicly available for everybody to see.  Then the office makes a report to the Minister stating that it warned this local authority that it should be not doing what it is doing, the local authority has given the office reasons but the office does not accept them, and the Minister needs to take this into account.  It is not possible for a Minister to say \"nothing to see here\" on that basis because it is not the same as the interaction that happens sometimes between a Minister and his or her own planning authority in the Department.  It is an independent regulatory office making an assessment and making a recommendation, that the Minister will have to respond to in writing, that will also be published and on which the Minister can be questioned.<\/p> <p>  I agree that we need to change the current system in terms of accountability of the Minister which is what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is getting at here.  However, it would not be fair to describe what we are doing here as still allowing a Minister to be blind to good planning decisions because if the Minister is, the political system in Ireland is fairly abrasive when decisions are being questioned by the Opposition, media, etc.  The only question is whether that is how we should deal with this in terms of transparency and accountability or should we go down the route of giving the regulator all the power.  We have landed on the side of the fence whereby democratic accountability, scrutiny and transparency should be the final decision-making structure here as opposed to a regulator who essentially merely takes this decision out of the Minister's office altogether.<\/p> <p>  By the way, I note we must be cautious about naming names but we have had tribunals who have named names very publicly.  There is nothing secret about this.  We have had a planning system in Ireland that has been fundamentally corrupted in the past, in particular, at a zoning level in terms of area plans, etc., with very inappropriate developments happening on the back of that which have impacted on the quality of life of thousands of people.<\/p> <p>  I take Deputy Casey's point.  I would have been a member of Cork County Council putting together a county development plan 12 or 13 years ago.  The process is now different but it is still not perfect by a long shot.  The pressure that councillors get exposed to from vested interests, in terms of land zoning, etc., is still not as it should be.  I would like to have the recommendations of an independent planning regulator, for example, looking at guidelines and appropriate ways in which meetings should be held and looking at physical separation between those who are making decisions and those who are trying to influence those decisions.  Those are the kind of matters on which the new regulator's office can make strong recommendations.  Having said that, the process is a lot cleaner than it was previously.<\/p><p>The view that we are taking here is that the buck stops with the Minister, but that all of the factors which influence the Minister's decision are very public with regard to transparency, accountability and availability of information for everybody to look at.  On balance, that is probably a better approach than simply saying that the Minister is not capable of making these decisions and cannot be trusted and therefore everything should be handed over to a regulator's office.  That is where we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#G00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I agree with much of the debate here.  What the Minister is saying finds an echo in my experience as well since I was a councillor for many years.<\/p> <p>  Many years ago, we were doing a new development plan.  As an elected member, I was awaiting the outcome of what the proposed development plan would be.  I got a phone call from a developer in Drogheda who said he wanted to see me.  I decided to go and see him.  He produced for me a copy of the development plan that nobody on the council and no elected member had seen.  Being shocked at that, I wrote to the Minister of the day and outlined to him what had happened.  The Minister wrote back to me - and it is on the record - saying that he could not intervene because what I had seen was a draft development plan and was not the actual development plan because it was only a proposal.<\/p> <p>  That goes to the heart of what can happen in local government.  A plan which no developer should ever have seen, certainly not before the elected members discussed it, was actually in the domain of people who were out making a profit on it down the road.  I am sure other people will hear and know that certain landowners or farmers are approached by some fellow in a car saying, \"Come here.  Look over the hedge, would you?  Sell me those couple of fields in the middle of nowhere.\"  Suddenly, those fields turn out to be very valuable.  There are issues there.<\/p> <p>  I agree there is greater transparency, but one of the problems I find is that if and when elected members state at a meeting that they are not participating in a vote because they have an interest in the issue, the record does not show what that interest is.  I have looked at and am still looking at situations around some planning decisions which I believe are fundamentally wrong.  If someone is an elected member, that person then takes part in the debate on a development plan.  While he or she may then say nothing, having a vested interest and having declared it, the public should know what that interest is.  There should be an obligation to say what that interest is.  I know there is an obligation to make a declaration of interest anyway, but I would be concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Casey.  There is greater transparency and accountability, but I agree with the Minister that there is not enough.  I will go back to the key point.  I am very concerned when elected members decide to overrule professional planners on as serious a matter as a development plan.  I have noted where decisions have been made which were wrong in my view - and I was not a member of the council.  Communities are left with very bad decision-making.<\/p> <p>  The other point I want to make is on the question of where there are two adjoining authorities.  Income is quite often an issue for local authorities.  I am referring to income from commercial development.  If I am in County Meath and there is a proposed development on the border of Louth, but still in County Meath, suddenly one might find that there is an out-of-town shopping development there, and the reason the council may give permission, apart from the wonderful planning considerations it has in mind, is that it generates an income for a local authority.  The adjoining local authority loses a huge benefit to its own income.  The reality, and what I am saying here, is that there are problems with adjoining local authorities.  The town centre of Drogheda has been destroyed by planning permissions granted by Meath County Council.  There is no doubt about it.  There is a street in Drogheda which is totally derelict because of bad planning decisions which were made, even if they were made legally.  There are other issues which should be taken into consideration for closely adjoining counties when planning applications are made for either, which can implicitly and definitively impact on the other local authority.  I know this may not be a debate for today.<\/p> <p>  I have had a lifetime of planning decisions which went wrong and I welcome this development.  I note the powers of the new planning authority and regulator enable the regulator to refer to the Minister and for the Minister to refer to the regulator.  That is another point.  If a complaint comes to the Minister, the Minister is not going to say that is terrible and he is going to stop that.  If the Minister is wise - and the Department will recommend this - it will go to the regulator.  I would think that the centre of gravity for investigations and complaints outside of corruption issues will, in fact, rest with the new regulator.  If the Minister does not refer to the regulator, how can that Minister say that he or she reached a fair decision?  I think that the traffic will be more to the regulator than to the Minister.  I would think the Minister would not get away with dealing with an issue without referring to the regulator.  The regulator also has other powers.  It is not some weak, cocooned individual.  It has powers to refer it to the Garda and to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  There are many other powers in there that perhaps we could and should go through.<\/p> <p>  Is it a better country after this legislation, notwithstanding whatever faults people might find?  I would say that it definitely will be.  Is it more transparent?  It is.  There is more work to be done, but it is certainly a significant step in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#H00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The Minister made the hypothetical case that there might be a Minister with responsibility for the environment who is rather aggressive or bullheaded - I think pigheaded is the word the Minister used.

We have been quite good at regulation.  It has not all worked.  It came from Europe as a structure to force the Irish public administration system into use of regulators.  Our former communications regulator is now the Permanent Secretary in the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in the UK.  Our former energy regulator is now head of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, Ofgem, in the UK as well.  The one before her went up to be the UK's water regulator.  That is a sign that we had good quality regulators.  They were good at what they did.  They are market regulators.  This is slightly different.  It is more akin to the EPA, the Data Protection Commissioner or the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in the way that the broadcasting authority has to advise the Minister on a media merger at the moment and give a published recommendation.  This is a slightly different type of regulator but we should not be afraid of the use of regulation.  I agree with the Minister that the regulator should not have the final say.  I think it is right that the Minister has the final say.  We believe in democratic political representation and the Minister being the final accountable person.<\/p> <p>  The concern I have is at the other end of the democratic issue.  Whatever about the Minister having the final say, we also have to ask how we get good councillors and good regional authorities.  How they interact with the regulator is just as important as how the Minister does.  They are going to be involved in the day-to-day stuff.  I believe the ills of our democracy are cured by more democracy.  I do not think we can just shut out councillors and take away responsibility because of the corruption we have seen.  We have to make sure that they are more accountable and incentivised in the right way.  Our councillors were incentivised by the profit interests for developers.  That meant low standards and not taking into account externalities, and ignoring the interconnection of public infrastructure.  Those were the fundamental failings.  We need to flip that so that they are always thinking of how to get high environmental standards, high social quality, integrated planning, good public space and so on.<\/p><p>The regulator has to set the rules or conditions in which that is encouraged, rather than the quick-buck, low quality, development which is desired because of corruption or because the local authority gets revenue from it and takes an attitude of \"sure feck it, never mind about the quality, if there are 100 apartments and a &euro;10,000 levy each, it will fund the council.\"  The regulator has an important role in setting conditions where the councillors themselves must think of really high quality development.  Particularly on the national planning framework, where that is evolving and moving to, it is not a top-down process that tells cities and towns how it will work but instead it asks cities and towns how they think they can work to create high quality, low-carbon, quality public space developments.  The regulator has to be flexible, not only with the Minister having the final say, but providing the guidance without completely killing the initiative of local authorities to be able to come up with good quality development.  <\/p><p> To respond to the Minister on my amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 15, the intention behind them was not that the regulator would have a second An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeals process around an individual application, as he put it, or to look at it on an individual case basis but to review the broad application of Part VIII.  It is one element, which in our experience, a number of local authorities use it in a way that is not high quality development.  It is not the specific case in which we are interested, but the broad performance, reporting on the overall approach to Part VIII.  The way this might work would be to take best of class and highlight it as a really good local authority that is doing good, high quality development that is bringing life back into the centre of towns, not out of town centres. It would be about promoting the good as much as policing the bad.  Those amendments were not designed to catch out individual development, but to review how local authorities themselves operate within the planning system which is one test of their overall philosophy or approach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#H00500","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>We are spending a lot of time on this but it is the core of the whole thing so we will be able to zip through the other amendments quickly.  That is up to the Chair, I am sure we will spend some time on them.  The actual powers and the interaction between this office, the Minister and local authorities is key to this legislation.  We are trying to get the balance right with democratic accountability, ensuring that planning decisions are consistent with the policy of the Government of the day, whether that is to dramatically increase the priority of climate change, or respond to a housing need, or get a national planning framework and establish consistency around that such as transport and the other things that are needed around good planning, and this is why were are spending more time on this section rather than pushing it to a vote, if people wish to vote on it.<\/p> <p>  Part VIII  is not specifically referred to but the planning, procedures and decision making processes and their review is very much the role of the new regulator's office.  If its view is that there is something amiss in the Part VIII system, it will make recommendations to us about that.  There will be nothing stopping a member of the public or a political party from writing to the regulator's office to express their concern and ask him or her to look at it and come back with recommendations to Government or the Minister.  If those recommendations are there, if we are talking about the teeth in the tiger, the Minster does have real edge to his or her powers to intervene and give instructions to a local authority to change a process or decision.  The provision reads: \"Where a Minister gives a direction under this section, the planning authority shall report to the Minister the results of the review conducted pursuant to the direction and shall comply with any direction which the Minister may, after consultation with the planning authority as regards to those results, give in relation to all or any of the measures which were subject of a review.\"  The Minister will get a review from the regulator's office, and acting on that is a very direct power or order.  Obviously, that should be a last resort.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the point made earlier that we cannot simply take a patronising view of councillors that we do not trust them to make decisions and therefore the Minister will take charge.  We have to find a way to ensure that local councils make decisions and have a way of interacting with a new regulator's office that helps them to understand the parameters around which decisions need to be made and also to require other state entities, for example the National Transport Authority, to be forced to integrate its plans into county development plans so it happens in a seamless way.  Anyone who has been to any of the consultations we have had around the national planning framework will have heard me and others talk about the consequences for towns of not having done that over the last 20 years.  There are so many towns in commuter distance of Dublin where tens of thousands of people commute every day, spending hours in their cars, without public transport options, having chosen to live somewhere because it is the only place they could afford to buy a house while they work in Dublin.  We are surely smarter than that in how we plan for the future.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Fergus O'Dowd made a number of points about the incentive for some local authorities that may border towns to rely on the population of that town for a commercial proposition that gives them a rates space on the other side of that border and the consequences for town centres and so on.  I take his point, and these are the kinds of consideration that we are looking at in the national planning framework and the Ireland 2040 plan.  They are also the kind of issues that a new independent planning regulator's office could make recommendations on.  If a Minister needs to make unpopular decisions in changing procedures and structures at local authority level, I would not want those to be outsourced to a planning regulator because the political system finds it hard to ask local authorities to change.  <\/p> <p>  This has been a good discussion and we will think about what people have said.  If we can look at ways we can add to the wording already there, I will do that but for the moment I will only accept amendment No. 14 and we cannot accept the other Opposition amendments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#J00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 7 to 13, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p><blockquote>In page 9, line 24, after &ldquo;assemblies&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in respect of&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#J00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 15 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 21, inclusive, Nos. 24 to 29, inclusive, Nos. 39 to 44 inclusive, and Nos. 60 to 65, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#J00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<\/p><blockquote>In page 10, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:&ldquo;(b) the national transition objective established in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>I will speak to my amendment No. 16 and I intend to press it.  To a certain extent, what this amendment proposes involves a continuation of the previous debate on the overarching objectives, rules or boundaries within which we give councils freedom to come back.  All of these are key environmental objectives.  We are more specific in various sections in setting out the functions and the requirements in terms of policies and objectives that need to take place.  It is important that we come in on the planning side.<\/p><p> We have to take account of a very standard issue direction, which we see in much legislation.  We take into account the public interest and the effect the performance of the office may have on the strategic economic or social importance of the State.  We always put the economic interests first.  The problem with our development planning system is that everyone is cheering for the economic side.  The developers are looking for their slice and to have the lowest standards possible.  The council officials are looking for as much development as possible to secure revenue to run the council.  No one is standing up for the wider long-term planning issues around how we develop a low carbon society, how we protect our diversity, ensuring that we do not build on flood plains and how we can get our water system right.  We would have been much better off if our planning system during the past 50 to 100 years had made such provision when it came to each planning application.  I have seen an example of this in Sandyford in my local authority area.  Planning was being proposed for many developments, including a skyscraper with alpine gardens on the 34th floor.  We did not have the water or the wastewater system to accommodate that.  It was a disastrous item of planning.  All the planning had to be stopped in Sandyford Industrial Estate and that resulted in a half-finished estate because of a failure to bring together what we need to do, which is the water framework directive, the floods directive, the biodiversity action plan and our latest Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  Putting them front and centre stage is the right way to go because they are the first elements that we need to get right, and if we do so, we will get higher quality development for social reasons, it will be more economically efficient in the long run because we will not have to go back to people who are stuck in the middle of a flood plain or we will not have to retrofit water infrastructure, which is incredibly expensive.  We would be getting it right from the start.  <\/p><p> We should be upfront in saying that what we want our planning system to do is to take the best of European regulations in the water framework directive, the national biodiversity action plan and the low carbon obligations.  The reason we need to do that is that we are only starting to understand the scale of the change required for us to meet our climate change objectives.  It must be stitched into everything.  It must be front and centre of everything.  Our transport system must be completely changed.  We must also change our energy system and our buildings.  People have to be brought back to the centre.  We have to stop the sprawl.  The reason we included these requirements in all these amendments is to come back to that central point.  There is not a sufficient signal or emphasis on the environmental element which is also the same as the social element.  There is a natural constituency to look after the economic; the economic will look after itself but it would be better if we were to get the environmental element right.  That is what these amendments seek to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#J00900","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I fully support the amendments and I can second them if that is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#K00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?

My concern is that if we list the specific directives that he mentioned, we would then need to have amending legislation to add another one in the future.  We would become not such much a prisoner to that list, which is a positive one, whereas what we are doing here is trying to have a framework that accommodates our responsibilities across all directives.

(1) The office shall, in performing its functions have regard to-----&quot; and paragraph (d) states:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;the requirements of relevant acts of the European Union, in particular, those relating to&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, <br \/><br \/>(ii) Directive 2001\/42\/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment,<br \/><br \/>(iii) the Habitats Directive, and <br \/><br \/>(iv) the Birds Directives,<br \/><br \/>in so far as those requirements relate to planning authorities by virtue of being designated as competent authorities ...&quot; and so on. <\/blockquote> <p>The section also states: &quot;The office shall, in performing its functions have regard to ... the policies and objectives for the time being of the Government, a State authority, ... planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions have, or may have, a bearing on the proper planning and sustainable development of cities, towns, villages or other areas, whether urban or rural ...&quot;.  <\/p><p>I would happily use a regulation to list the current directives that need to be factored in with respect to good planning policy but there is a problem with listing them separately.  I refer to the national biodiversity action plan, the all-Ireland national pollinator plan, the water framework directive, the EU directives on air quality and the flood directive.  I will deal with the Climate Change and the Low Carbon Development Act separately because it is a  separate issue.  If we were to change the national biodiversity action plan and it was to be called something else, we would have to amend the legislation, which is a laborious process at the best of times, to take account of that.  We are putting a framework in place that represents good legislation that allows me or a future Minister to update the lists of directives and plans that are relevant in terms of consideration for the planning office.  I will happily talk to the Deputy about how we can do that but I do not want to have an outdated reference in the legislation, where a person in 20 years time might say one is referring to the national biodiversity action plan or the all-Ireland national pollinator plan but that was two plans previously.<\/p><p>I have a different view on the national transition objectives established in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  I would like to consider having a slightly different wording on that because that Act may be changed in the future and be updated.  We may decide to take a different approach to dealing with climate change in the future and that needs to be factored in.  I would like to have a specific reference to climate change and low carbon development in this legislation but I would like to take advice on how best to include that in a way that ensures it would not become outdated in terms of the terminology we use.  If the Deputy is  willing to work with us on that, we will try to come forward with something.  The broader objectives of climate change are of such import that we need to reference that in terms of how we make decisions around planning, zoning and how people move around, and that also must be a major objective of the national planning framework.The other plans and directives are important.  We can reference them in regulations, and we already do.  I point to the requirements of relevant Acts of the European Union - we already cover them.  If we list them and they might be outdated in ten years time in terms of terminology or content, we would be stuck with that reference in the legislation.  That will not work.  The way to deal with that is by way of regulation where a Minister could update the reference by way of a statutory instrument or ministerial order.  I would like to accommodate the broader policy objective in legislation around a progression to a low carbon economy or something like that if we can get the terminology right.  I would be willing to accept or to bring forward wording on that on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#K00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Those are very weak arguments.

We are late in producing our second river basin management plan.  I am not sure if work in the Department on the water extraction registration regime has actually taken place.  The track record of compliance on just those three directives makes a compelling argument for making Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment.  In terms of his concern that by naming them, we will have a difficulty with future directives or changes to existing ones, the Minister's own argument undermines it.  It is technically covered by the inclusion of relevant EU Acts.  To be doubly sure, there is no reason the Minister could not make his own amendment to Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment on Report Stage to give him the power to add future directives or changes to existing directives by way of regulations.

Things are amended and plans changed.  I appreciate Deputy Eolin &Oacute; Broin being supportive on the likes of the Water Framework Directive and the floods directive.  While it is possibly covered by the current wording, we all know that one of the disadvantages of regulatory systems is that they are very bureaucratic.  As bureaucrats do not have a mandate, what they look for is legislative support on what to prioritise.  Therefore, citing the directives is not unimportant.  What Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin said about the likes of the river basin is true.  That thinking about the State in terms of physical infrastructure, river basin catchment management and land use management from the mountaintop down to the sea in a special integrated land use plan represents the way we need to go.  When we stitch in the Water Framework Directive and the floods directive, it shows the intent that we plan land use in a really effective way.  There is a case for including the directives, with the environmental impact assessment directive, because they are equally important when it comes to planning.  We have seen the cost to individuals when the State ignores flooding and water planning.  I welcome the Minister's willingness to consider how to word the amendment.  We will certainly come back to his officials in looking at the wording of amendment No. 16 and how we could stitch in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  That would be the right approach.  If the existing Act is amended at any stage, it would easily be automatically updated.  <\/p> <p>  It is very important that the particular amendment go in right at the top.  Not only do officials look to see which functions are mentioned, but by placing the directives centre stage, the whole planning system would focus on the massive leap we needed to make towards a low carbon system.  That is something we are not doing.  One of the reasons this is important is we are moving completely in the opposite direction to the reality of what is happening on the ground.  In another committee of which I am a member IBEC is making the most insane proposals on roads, as if the climate is not a problem.  Its view is let us have motorways everywhere.  That is what the big money wants.  We, therefore, need someone to say no, that we should do it differently when it comes to the environment and move towards a low carbon system.  By putting it front and centre as the first key policy at which we need to look, the legislation would send that signal.  I, therefore, welcome the Minister's willingness to consider the wording of the amendment in that regard and will quite happily look at how we might do it.  I will withdraw amendments Nos. 17 and 18 on the pollinator plan, as much as I love it, and the biodiversity action plan because I recognise that plans can change.  However, I would like to hold on to the possibility of stitching in the Water Framework Directive, the air quality directive and the floods directive because they are elemental to how we plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I want to make sure I am being consistent in what I am saying.  In the proposed draft legislation there is a specific mention of the habitats directive and the birds directive.  We also mention the environmental impact assessment directive and the strategic environmental assessment directive.  We refer more generally to the requirements of relevant Acts of the European Union.  Please allow me to check if there would be a problem in adding in the Water Framework Directive and EU air quality directive.  We might have to include a rider in words such as \"and subsequent follow-on European agreements\" or something like them.  My only concern is that we will have outdated legislation in five years' time.  From my experience, what we normally would do is say EU directives would be taken account of and named in regulations at a later stage.  There are some directives named in the legislation, but we have not included others.  I want to understand why that is the case.  Let us have a complete and proper list.  If the Deputy is okay with it, I can bring forward such an amendment on Report Stage.  If we are mentioning the habitats directive and the birds directive, I see no reason we should not mention the other directives to which Deputy Eamon Ryan is referring.  If there is a good reason for not doing so, I will provide it, but if there is not, we will include them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of national plans and policies, it is different issue.  If we are upgrading or changing them, that is something of which we need to take account.  With regard to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, we may well have a new Act dealing with climate change in the years ahead that potentially will be much more ambitious.  We do not, therefore, want to be stuck with a reference to the old legislation and to have to come back to the committee with a small amendment that would take weeks to get through.  I would like to have a more generalised but, at the same time, quite ambitious reference to climate change and moving towards a low-carbon society, as opposed to a low-carbon economy only.  We will look at the directives to see if we can include a more complete list and whether we can or cannot add them to the list or to regulations linked with this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L00500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 16 being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L00600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I will not press it with a view to discussing it with the Minister and his officials before Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L00700","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy withdrawing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I would like to keep it live, subject to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L00900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Once the Deputy has mentioned it on Committee Stage, he can bring it forward on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L01000","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I am fine with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L01100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 17 to 21, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<\/p><blockquote>In page 15, line 14, to delete &ldquo;(2) Where&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(3) Where&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L01400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 23, 31, 34, 35, 38, 45 and 49 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L01600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p><blockquote>In page 22, line 23, to delete &ldquo;and assess, at least at a strategic level&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, assess and where appropriate make legally binding determinations&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>As amendments Nos. 23 to 45, inclusive, have been substantively discussed, I intend to withdraw them.<\/p><p>However, I wish first to make a point about amendment No. 49 and to hear the Minister's response, after which I will withdraw that amendment as well.  I wish to emphasise one issue.  I mentioned it at the end of our previous discussion but I want to press it a little further.  Amendment No. 49 refers to the ability of the office of the planning regulator to take complaints from individuals or third parties, etc.  The Minister was conferring with his officials while I was making the point that I agree with him that what we do not want is a second round of appeal in the planning process.  It is not the intention of this amendment to slow down planning applications that, for example, have already gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p> I made a comparison with the Department of Social Protection, which has an independent appeals process.  A final decision is made.  If someone feels that something in the process was not correct, he or she can make a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.  That does not delay the decision of the Department of Social Protection.  It does not allow the Ombudsman to review the substantive decision of the Department of Social Protection appeals office but it allows for complaints concerning, for example, malpractice or unfairness.  I know the Minister will not accept the amendment and I will not press it.  However, regarding the issue of whether or not, for example, whistleblowers or individuals should be able to make complaints, my reading of the legislation is that this is not currently possible.  Rather than it just being the Minister, planning authorities or the regulator itself, I think such a measure can be provided for under this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#L01700","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>My understanding is that this is covered and that the Bill, as drafted, already makes sufficient provisions for the investigation of complaints by the office of the planning regulator and ensures that these complaints can, where appropriate, be referred to more appropriate statutory authorities, including the Ombudsman, the Standards in Public Office Commission or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for them to make an assessment of the procedure that has resulted in a decision being made in respect of which an accusation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#M00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I could have misread the section.

With regard to amendment No. 50, one of the key functions of the office of the planning regulator is to undertake reviews of the systems and procedures of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of the performance of their functions under the planning Acts.  Under planning legislation the enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority, which can take action under the extensive enforcement provisions provided for in Part VIII of the principal Act if a development does not have the required permission or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  However, I agree it would be prudent to have a provision whereby the Minister can ask the planning regulator to conduct a review of a planning authority where there might be issues around the exercise of its enforcement functions, in other words, if there are inconsistencies in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with established practice, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment on the basis that I will examine the legal and drafting aspects of the proposed amendment with a view to tabling an appropriately worded amendment on this matter on Report Stage.  There are issues with the words \"desirable level\" in the phrase \"is failing to achieve a desirable level of compliance with planning law\".  That terminology is something of a moveable feast.  It is subjective in terms of who is doing the desiring.  If we are to do that, we require tighter legal wording.  However, I do not have a problem with the point being made.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 51 and 52.  These amendments, collectively, go beyond the intended functions of the office of the planning regulator by proposing that the office should have oversight in respect of the exercise of enforcement functions of planning authorities.  It is not intended that the office of the planning regulator will have a power to investigate individual planning complaints.  However, as previously signalled, the office will have scope to review the organisational systems and procedures employed by planning authorities in respect of their enforcement functions where it receives indications by way of complaints that the said functions are not being adequately performed.  This is the most appropriate means of addressing enforcement related issues by the office of the planning regulator.  Giving the planning regulator power to address individual planning complaints would in all probability seriously undermine the effectiveness of the office due to the likelihood of being inundated with individual planning complaints.  That would be counterproductive in terms of delivering on its core objectives and functions.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 53 is a minor technical amendment to clarify the procedures to be followed by the office of the planning regulator in considering complaints received by it, in the undertaking of examinations and reports and in the onward submission of reports to specified bodies such as the planning authority, the Minister or both or, alternatively, to the Ombudsman, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or to such other State authorities as may be prescribed for appropriate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#N02600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's points regarding amendments Nos. 51 and 52 and will withdraw them.

In general, I am a believer in turnover on these things in terms of bringing in fresh thinking.  That is not always appropriate but it is something that should be encouraged.  From my perspective, there will be a ministerial input into finalising the choice of person here but it will be an open competition managed by the Public Appointments Service to get the best person.

The problem with that is if people lobby heavily and get their names recommended through connections or contacts, there could be three people who are really good on one panel and there will be another panel that is not great.  In that situation, the Minister is forced to prefer somebody from a separate panel because of the category he or she happens to come under even though he or she may not be as good as someone who the Minister is not able to accept because of those limitations.

Perhaps that is to exaggerate for effect but a person's politics should not necessarily be the focus.  The focus needs to be the skillset that is required.  Most people in Ireland have voted one way or the other at different times in their lives.  That should not necessarily be held against a person unless of course he or she has a connection with something inappropriate or corruption.  That should rule the person out.

I make no bones in saying that in the past political appointments have not been appropriate, but the new systems in place have modernised the process.

We have radically changed the way in which such appointments are made in recent years.  That was the right thing to do and we will continue to develop that thought process, but this will be a competitive open process in which people who believe they have the skill set to do this job will be able to apply.  They will go through a fairly robust assessment screening-interview process before the Public Appointments Service will recommend names of persons it regards have the skill set to do the job.

To give an example, when Deputy Alan Kelly was Minister, he introduced legislation to restrict the ability of local authorities to opt for higher standards.  There was an example in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown where the council was seeking to implement passive house standards which have a higher standard of building rating.  As I recall, the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, introduced a provision in section 28 of the principal Act to allow him to restrict local authorities from setting higher standards.  That brings me back to the earlier discussion about how we still need to free up local authorities and not completely disempower councillors but to encourage them to start doing innovative things which are in tune with the principles and objectives of the policy system we may want.  The amendment will remove that legislative provision which is unnecessarily restrictive on local authorities.  It is better to look for best case examples.  In some cases it will work and in other cases it will not work and we learn from the mistakes and move on.  To my mind, ruling out the ability of local authorities to opt for higher standards is inappropriate and that is the reason I will press this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#Q00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>To clarify, I did vote against that in the development plan but my reason is that I did not think it was achievable for many reasons.

The amendment relates to section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Section 28 provides that planning authorities shall have regard to guidelines issued by the Minister in the performance of their planning functions, that is, in the determination of planning applications and in the adoption of development plans.  However, section 28 was amended in 2015 by the insertion of a new subsection 1C, which elaborated on the original provisions by introducing a new power whereby the Minister may, within section 28 guidelines, expressly state specific planning policy requirements to be applied by planning authorities or the board, as appropriate, in the exercise of their functions.  This provision enables one to distinguish, in terms of the content of the guidelines, between advisory or general commentary on the one hand and specific requirements that have to be mandated by planning authorities in the performance of their planning functions.<\/p> <p>  This provision was critical to underpinning the revisions of the 2007 apartment standard guidelines which issued in early 2016 and contain specific new requirements that must be applied by planning authorities on minimum apartment sizes, the number of lifts per apartment, car parking provisions, floor to ceiling heights, and the provision of dual aspect apartments thereby ensuring their consistent application by planning authorities.  The new revised apartment standard guidelines issued under section 28 represent a change in the national planning policy which must now be implemented by planning authorities in determining of planning applications and the adoption of development plans.  The inclusion of the relevant new subsection 1C in section 28 of the 2000 Act further enables future revisions to existing planning guidelines or new planning guidelines to be expressed and applied in a clear manner and will improve consistency and certainty in the planning process generally by distinguishing in policy terms between matters to be determined locally by planning authorities and by national policy set by the Minister of the day.  Amendment No. 66 proposes to remove the provisions relating to the incorporation of specific planning policy requirements in ministerial planning guidelines, as introduced in the 2015 Planning and Development (Amendment) Act and therefore I cannot accept it.<\/p> <p>  There may be some good examples around the country of local authorities that want to do more progressive things and want to factor that in as a requirement or where possible into their development plans.  There may also be examples where local authorities look to go in the other direction to try to create a competitive edge for their area, to try to reduce costs for developers or to do things that we might be very uncomfortable with.  If we were to have a situation where a Minister could not intervene to ensure there are at least set parameters within which local authorities can set their development plans we could potentially have a completely different quality of design in different parts of cities depending on the opinion that prevails in the council.  Dual aspect requirements for apartment design, for example, is a decision that has made it more expensive on one level to produce apartment complexes and perhaps that is something we should examine, but it was a decision that was put in place for good reason.  If we were to decide local authorities could just disregard that because they happen to have a different view locally then there would be accusations about a potential race to the bottom and standards that might result in different areas wanting to attract development by changing standards and making it easier to do it and in other areas there might be a race to the top whereby it is much more expensive or less viable to build or develop.  The most important thing is that &ndash; excluding commercial influence &ndash; there needs to be a basic standard above or below which we ensure decisions are made.<\/p> <p>  For a Minister not to have the power to be able to ensure there is commonality of standards would be very problematic in terms of the unintended, or in some cases the intended, consequences of that.  We must ensure there is consistency across local authority areas while at the same time leaving a sufficient level of flexibility for local authorities to be able to do innovative things.  That is the reason the legislation was introduced a number of years ago to deal with the issue.  That is why, for example, we need it to alter the guidelines in terms of ensuring we have appropriate ceiling height and an appropriate size of apartments in terms of quality of life issues and that we do not have inappropriate or inconsistent decisions being made locally with what we were trying to achieve through better planning and design linked to national policy considerations.  I am afraid this is one of the amendments on which I disagree with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#Q00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for reminding me that the provision was not just about building standards in terms of energy use it was also about such issues as the number of car parking spaces, the size of apartments and the basic fabric of the building.

Fundamentally, it is a race to the bottom which will cost us in the long run.  We are setting up an independent regulator and a process to encourage councillors.  That legislative diktat from 2008 goes against that completely.  The measure is fairly sweeping and does remove in a significant way the ability of councillors to innovate, as in the example I outlined.  One does want to encourage people to have a race to the top and to have some flexibility in that regard.  If we are going to set up a regulatory system the Minister must give councillors some encouragement to be innovative and to set local standards that are appropriate to an area.  It was a case of a legislative hammer striking a small nut.  The provision goes against the spirit of this legislation and it should be removed.

It is the first time I have heard anybody say it that explicitly.  The issue around apartment sizes or dual aspect apartments is that when one puts a family in a high rise apartment without back or front gardens, dual aspect is vital to the quality of the family's life.  It brings something to apartment living that otherwise is not there.  I have lived in two high rise buildings, both of which were dual aspect and both of which were local authority builds in two other jurisdictions.  The battle, and this is where I believe the Minister is wrong, is that clearly there is a cost implication in the provision of certain units but there is also a quality of life outcome for the people who live in them.  If the issue is that providing better quality of life outcomes for people is more costly, we must find ways of reducing the costs elsewhere.

However, where they are trying to improve, whether that is energy efficiency, the carbon footprint or quality of life outcomes, that should be encouraged and where there are cost implications for development, that should be examined elsewhere in the system.

That process is under way at present.  However, we must also try to ensure that we create communities and clusters that are much easier to serve in terms of infrastructure, amenity and all the other things that can be done in towns and villages but which are much more demanding of the State in the context of ribbon development.  That is not to say there will not be some one-off housing as, of course, there will be.  However, when one sees the number of vacant properties in towns and villages across rural Ireland and the demand for housing in those areas, we must try to connect the dots there in a more effective way than we have managed to do in the past.  Nevertheless, I take the Deputy's point.<\/p> <p>  To clarify, Deputy &Oacute; Broin is making an incorrect interpretation of what I am saying.  There is no ceiling on any developer regarding the quality of what they produce.  The guidelines we have are about having a floor standard in place and where that floor kicks in.  If the floor is set significantly higher in one local authority, there are often unintended consequences to that in terms of the cost of building there and potentially not being able to provide affordable homes in certain areas because the only apartments that will be built will be extremely expensive both to build and to buy.  We must try to have a housing policy element to ensure that different household types and different mixed tenure and mixed type communities can be facilitated in every local authority area.  We should not decide, by making decisions in one local authority area, that only one type of family or person will be able to come into that area.  That was our fear in that regard.  In fact, the changes here were not about D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but about Dublin City Council.  That council had decided to set its own size considerations in respect of apartments and we examined that.  We did not reduce the national guidelines relating to apartment size.  We just asked Dublin City Council to respect them.  I remember the conversation the Government had at the time.  It was a different Minister.<\/p> <p>  That was painted by many people as the State requiring smaller apartments but, in fact, the national guidelines remained quite consistent.  However, Dublin City Council had gone beyond them and we required it to respect national guidelines.  There was also clarity regarding ceiling height, dual aspect and a series of other matters.  We have seen a significant improvement in the quality of build, whether it is local authority housing, privately built housing or approved housing bodies housing, be it apartments or family homes.  We will improve inspection procedures around that.  The building regulations are tighter than ever and we will be introducing a new mandatory registration process for all builders and contractors in the country.  At present, it is a voluntary list.  We are learning lessons and moving in the right direction.  The point I am making here is that the Minister must ensure a minimum standard, on which we can all agree.  The question is where that bar is set, whether one allows local authorities to go way beyond it for their local areas and the consequences of that.<\/p> <p>  My final point is that what we are doing here is establishing a new planning regulator.<\/p><p>If we do not have national policy guidelines for the regulator, it will not have a basis for assessment, decision making or recommendations.  If we allow local authorities to do their own thing, there will be no national standard against which the regulator can measure them.  The new planning regulator's office needs to have a minimum standard or benchmark by which it assesses decisions.  That is why this is important.  Otherwise the regulator would only be assessing local authorities against localised decision making.  That defeats the purpose of having a national standard and a planning office.<\/p><p> I am always encouraging developers in particular, and the planning system, to make and approve planning applications that go way beyond the minimum standards.  I think passive housing is a great thing.  We are moving towards nearly zero energy buildings, NZEB, approaches, as well as A energy ratings and so on.  The more of that we can do, the better.  My job as Minister, however, is to make sure that we have a minimum standard which protects people's quality of life through better design and building, and which is enforced by a regulatory system.  By having that at a national level, allowing local authorities to encourage more if they want, the new regulator's office will be able to make sure that those standards are implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#R01000","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I do not think anything the Minister has just said contradicts my interpretation of how he phrased it the first time.

That initiative is something we do need, as well as regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#S00700","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I do not think anybody could accuse me of not trying to get local authorities to use their initiative in terms of new ways of building communities.  We are encouraging them to do that in terms of how they use publicly-owned land banks.  We are encouraging them to create partnerships between private builders and designers, to integrate local authority needs with private housing demand.  We are talking about affordable rental models that are quite different from anything we have seen in the past.  I want families living in city centres.  I have been banging that drum since the day I took office.<\/p> <p>  We should not be encouraging families working in Dublin to live in 3-bed semi-detached houses in Maynooth, Clane, Navan, Dunshaughlin, Portlaoise or wherever because they cannot afford to buy one in Dublin.  That is not a sustainable way forward for this city.  That is why I have been adamant that every city development plan needs to be looking at development from the inside out as opposed to the outside in.  We are seeing these huge doughnut-shaped areas around the commuter belts of cities.  Towns that 20 years ago had up to 5,000 people now have 20,000 people, with largely the same town centres and so on.  We are trying to change that.  At the same time, we have huge vacancy rates in our city centres and, in some cases, depopulation in city centres.  My own city is a good example of that.<\/p> <p>  I am all for different apartment sizes and shapes, linking in townhouses with apartment complexes, creating very diverse communities and so on.  The only thing we are talking about here is whether the Minister can set a minimum standard that has to be facilitated through the planning system, or whether we allow a local authority to move that minimum size, for example, up to a level that actually rules out a certain type of apartment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#S00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>No, he said the minimum has to be the same as the maximum.

As the Deputy probably knows, 44% of people on social housing lists are living on their own.  Some 25% of households in Ireland are single-occupancy households.  I know that because of the water debates; we were looking at the statistics yesterday in terms of how we should be setting the benchmark for excess water usage and so on.  Many of those people potentially could and should be living in city or town centres.<\/p> <p>  We have to use space more efficiently, through better design.  That is something Deputy Ryan talks about a lot in terms of density, quality of living and so on.  That is the context in which we want to have a minimum size below which we do not go.  By the way, it is considerably bigger than the minimum size in many countries.<\/p><p>Anyone who stays in an apartment in Paris would see shoeboxes all over the place.  There are tiny apartments that, in many cases, are just like tiny hotel rooms.  We are not allowing that any longer.  We are not allowing bedsits any longer.  It is up to developers to design and use space more efficiently.  Anybody who has looked at, for example, some of the apartments in the new Cherrywood development that use the minimum space required will have seen that, by using light, space and open-plan design differently, a lot more can be fitted into a smaller space.  Anyone who looks at those show apartments would see that, for a certain type of person, they are very good quality accommodation.  It is probably not family accommodation.  We need to ensure that there is family accommodation too.  The only point I am making is that if we do not have a common minimum standard across the country we will see different local authorities doing very different things.  We would be asking the regulator to do an impossible job.  It would potentially have to factor in 31 different sets of standards, as opposed to having a common basic standard in terms of what is acceptable and what is not.  That is the only point I am making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#S01000","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#T00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I understand I cannot press it but I will come back to it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#T00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I wanted to come in on a separate issue, but I think it pertains to documents that would be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#T00500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Before Deputy Coppinger starts, it is 12 noon.

The Minister may have referred to it earlier, but it is also something that could be put in here.  It would seem to me that it is an absolutely critical requirement to rule out some of the abuses that we have seen in the past.  It could even be added in as a third item to the points that the Minister has about documents that would be required.<\/p> <p>  People should be able to go online and to check out an application to see, for example, if a developer is in NAMA.  Has he or she fulfilled other developments?  That was something we have all seen on councils when we were councillors - developers leaving an estate unfinished and launching another application.  The planning authority does not seem to have any qualms about allowing them to have that application.

In other words, if the developer has a consistent record of poorly finishing estates, not fulfilling the terms and conditions of planning permissions, and so on, that record is factored in in terms of the appropriateness of granting planning to that person for building an estate in future.  I think that is new.  <\/p><p>We need to make sure that is not abused either.  If someone had a genuine reason for going bust, particularly in the last ten years, while trying to finish out an estate and is now back again and building properly, we have to be sure that consideration is not unfair.

We mentioned that earlier.  Second, they address the taking in charge of housing developments by local authorities.  I know these are subjects that are of interest to members of this committee, particularly Deputy Murphy, who tabled a Private Members' Bill a couple of years ago addressing the same issues.  Unfortunately, she is not here but we will give her a mention anyway.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 69 proposes that section 34 of the principal Act be amended by now requiring that planning authorities shall, in the assessment and determination of a planning application, have regard to, \"previous developments by the applicant which have not been satisfactorily completed,\" as well as \"previous convictions against the applicant for non-compliance with\" Planning Acts, either the Building Control Act 2007, or the Fire Services Act 1981, hereby taking account of the past performance of the applicant for planning permission.<\/p><p> In the same vein, this amendment further proposes that, instead of attaching conditions to planning permission relating to the giving of adequate security for the completion of a development, the wording in section 34 of the Act should be strengthened to allow planning authorities to attach conditions relating to \"the giving and maintaining of adequate security\" for the satisfactory completion of housing developments.  In other words, while the development is not completed, there will be an obligation to maintain that development as well as just an obligation to complete it.  We have had many examples, particularly in recent years, for understandable reasons, because many builders have got into financial difficulty, of estates not having been finished.  If there is a bond which is solely linked to the completion of the estate, there is an issue around the maintenance of the estate in the meantime which is something which has not been covered in previous legislation.  We want it to be covered now.  We are only too aware of the thousands of housing estates throughout the country which have been left in an unfinished state by developers over recent decades, leaving it to local authorities to have to take remedial action.  This situation is totally unacceptable and the new provisions in this amendment are intended to go some way to addressing this by giving planning authorities additional strength and powers in the attachment of conditions to planning permissions, requiring developers to both give and maintain adequate security to facilitate the satisfactory completion of housing estates.  In recognition of the priority attached to this issue both by myself and my officials, I would like to flag that I propose to table further amendments along these lines on Report Stage.<\/p><p> On amendment No. 76, section 180 of the principal Act outlines the procedures relating to the taking in charge of housing developments by local authorities.  This amendment is intended to improve and streamline the process.  Amendment No. 76 firstly addresses section 180(1) of the principal Act as presently constituted.  Subsection (1) requires that a planning authority shall, where it considers that developments have been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the permission granted, where requested by the developer or majority of the house-owners, initiate the taking in charge procedures under the Roads Act as soon as may be after being requested.  In light of this loose, non-specific wording on timelines, the first part of this amendment now proposes that local authorities shall initiate the taking in charge procedures \"not later than 6 months after being so requested\", thereby putting a specific timeline for acting on the request by local authorities.<\/p><p> The second change to section 180 proposed in this amendment is to provide that where a development has not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority, and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced by the planning authority to address the situation within four years of the expiration of the planning permission on the development, the planning authority shall, on being requested by the majority of the owners of the houses involved, take in charge the housing estate concerned.  The current time limit for this is seven years, so this is a further strengthening of section 180 and the taking in charge provisions.<\/p><p> The third change to section 180 proposed in this amendment is that where enforcement proceedings against a developer have not been commenced regarding the completion of a housing estate within four years of the expiry of the planning permission, the authority may, at its discretion and at any time after the expiration of the planning permission in question, initiate the taking in charge of the estates on the request of the majority of house-owners.  The four-year timeframe mentioned here is a reduction from the current seven-year timeframe.<\/p><p> The final amendment to section 180 essentially provides that where a planning authority takes and stays in charge, that will not preclude the authority from pursuing the developer for costs incurred in respect of further works undertaken on the development to bring it up to an acceptable, satisfactory state for the residents of the estate.  All told, these amendments incorporate some fundamental revisions to the existing section 180, on taking in charge provisions, with a view to ensuring that housing estates are more promptly taken in charge than heretofore.<\/p><p> I am sure the Deputies have the same complaints in their constituencies.  Particularly in the last ten years in our cities and built-up urban areas, there are many examples of estates that have not been taken in charge, there are bonds that are outstanding that are unable to be paid in some cases, and we need much more clarity for developers and for local authorities on what the rules of the game are.  How do we ensure that people who purchase homes are being looked after in a way that ensures that local authorities take estates in charge?  I have a number of examples where local authorities say, each year, that they cannot afford to take estates in charge and so are not going to do it.  I am sorry, but that is not good enough.<\/p><p> There is a requirement here to start the process of taking in charge.  We need to find a way of making that affordable, whether that is local authorities pursuing a developer for costs or whether, as one approaches the four-year timeframe, local authorities have to factor that into their budgets.  We cannot have a situation where a local authority just says that it is ignoring the estate down the road because there is no money.  Residents in such estates are in limbo.  They do not have a developer that can finish the estate and look after it properly and they have a local authority that says that it cannot afford to take it on, or is not taking it on for whatever reason.  I think this will put down a marker for everybody.<\/p><p> If people have any suggestions on Report Stage as to how we might be able to improve that, we will listen to that, but we have had the necessary discussions to try to get the balance right here with various different stakeholders.  I think it is a significant improvement on where we are today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#U02800","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>These two amendments are very important.  I generally welcome them.<\/p> <p>  The matter in amendment No. 76 is a massive problem in any area that has seen development in the last ten years and before that.  It was a problem when I was a councillor in the early 2000s, when so much development was taking place.  Even though developers were making substantial profits, they were still flying from area to area, leaving work undone and doing defective work.  I could catalogue many instances but will not do so here.  I want to raise some questions about the changes that the Minister is making and whether they are enough.<\/p> <p>  On the first change, I welcome that the wording \"not later than 6 months\" is there.  That is fine, but is four years still not far too long to give somebody to comply with what that person knew would be the conditions to comply with before undertaking the development?  Seven years was obviously far too long, but it still seems to me that four years is giving too much leeway, considering someone might be living in an area for four years which has had defective work done.  I do not know if the Minister is planning to amend this elsewhere, but the problem with the bonds is that they were far too low to be any kind of disincentive to a developer.  Some of the bonds used to be in the region of &euro;200,000.  They were simply a joke.  They were not a deterrent to any developer.  Developers could lodge the bond and then go off and do whatever they wanted to.  That is probably separate legislation, but is the Minister going to consider anything like that?<\/p><p>That was certainly the big problem we found in Fingal when so much development was taking place.<\/p><p> I welcome the intention to pursue developers for costs because we cannot expect local authorities to pick up the tab for what developers are meant to do.  Another separate issue which I do not suggest the Minister can address at this time relates to developers setting up management companies.  Most housing estates are multi-unit developments comprising apartments, duplexes and houses.  By setting up such management companies they make residents pay for maintenance.  That is an ongoing problem, especially in west Dublin, and it requires separate legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#V00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>On the four-year issue, we need to allow sufficient time for a legal process, for example, to take its course.  It will take time if a local authority is taking a developer to court.  The enforcement processes take time.<\/p> <p>  If local authorities are to take housing estates in charge, they must be able to factor in the cost.  One cannot just require them to take all housing estates in charge overnight in factoring the cost into the Estimates process.  My intention is that we will give a very clear signal that there are timelines, after which there will be a requirement to start the process of taking an estate in charge.  A well run local authority will account for that and plan for it financially.  It is also a very clear signal to developers that it will be a real problem for a developer who does not finish a housing estate to the quality that is consistent with the planning regulations.  We will introduce new legislation on building standards.  I suspect Deputy Ruth Coppinger will be interested in these provisions when the Bill comes through.  It will very much be about enforcement and creating a level playing field in order that the good developers and builders will not be at a disadvantage compared to those who cut corners.  A combination of the building standards, the mandatory register for builders and what we are doing here in the amendments will dramatically improve where we are today.<\/p> <p>  Past performance will also be taken into account, for example, where developers have caused real problems for local authorities in not finishing estates and, more importantly, for residents or local authorities that have paid for homes.  That will be taken into account as part of the decision-making process in planning.  There is a series of new layers, with which developers can live.  The good ones will welcome it and see it as a way of ensuring the same standards are being applied to everybody.  That is the way it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#W00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Section 10 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 70:<\/p><blockquote>In page 47, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Amendment of section 38 (availability of documents relating to planning applications) of Principal Act <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>11. <\/b>Section 38 of the Principal Act is amended by substituting the following for subsection (1) other than paragraphs (a) to (e):<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(1) Where a planning authority gives its decision in respect of a planning application the following documents shall be made available by the authority within 3 working days by placing the documents on its website, and may also make available such documents both in electronic form and for inspection and purchase by members of the public during office hours:&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#W00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491984000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed at 12.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>We are in public session.

Amendment No. 71 is a technical amendment to clarify an unforeseen outcome from the way in which the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 provided for reductions in the application of development contributions to assist in addressing the current housing supply shortage situation.  The amendment is intended to close a loophole in the 2015 Act whereby a developer who has not sold houses in a development and has been renting or leasing them thereby getting rental income in the process, could simultaneously apply for a reduction in the development contributions in respect of such houses, effectively gaining on the double.  This possibility was not intended in the 2015 Act and the amendment now clarifies that any reduction in respect of development contributions can only be availed of in the cases of houses that have not been rented, leased, occupied or sold.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 72 inserts a new section in the Bill to amend section 144 of the principal Act.  In this connection, section 144 enables the board, with the Minister's approval, to set fees for appeals and various other matters and functions with which the board is concerned.  The amendment proposes to insert a new subparagraph in section 144 to provide explicitly that the board may determine a fee for an appeal by a property owner against the proposed application of the vacant site levy by a planning authority under the provision of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 73 is now withdrawn as it is considered to be unnecessary.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 are technical amendments to Part XAB of the principal Act, specifically, in sections 177S and 177T.  Changes are proposed in these two amendments to close potential gaps in the principal Act.  To clarify that, the Minister will be the competent authority for the purpose of undertaking an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive of the draft national planning framework if such is required and to confirm who shall prepare the subsequent Natura impact report for the NPF - it will also be the Minister.<\/p><p>Government amendments Nos. 82 to 87, inclusive, all relate to what are minor technical amendments to the provisions relating to strategic housing developments in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  It is proposed that these amending provisions will come into operation on the enactment of this Bill.  I propose all of these Government amendments.<\/p><p>Moving on to the Opposition amendments, amendment No. 79 relates to section 179 of the principal planning Act which, in association with Part VIII of the planning regulations, sets out the arrangements for approval by local authorities of own-development proposals relating to social housing, local roads, libraries, community facilities, etc.  The amendment proposes to insert a new subsection (2A) in section 179 to provide that the regulations made under this section shall require a local authority, when notifying prescribed bodies or providing information to the public on any local authority-owned developed proposal, that the information provided shall be the same as required if the proposed development were subject to a planning application.  It is important to note that the Part VIII process is not the same as the application for planning permission but is rather a notice of intention to undertake a proposed development which is ultimately subject to the approval of the elected members.  In any event, the Part VIII provisions already set out the procedure to give public notice of, and ensure that the public and prescribed bodies are consulted on, any such proposed developments and inviting submissions.  I consider that the current Part VIII requirements are sufficient in this regard.  On this basis, I do not consider the amendment necessary and I am opposing it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 80 proposes to amend section 208 of the principal Act regarding public right of way.  This amendment, by Deputy Eamon Ryan, proposes to revise section 208 of the principal Act to provide that where a provision in a development plan or local area plan in force on the commencement of this section relates to the preservation of a public right of way, the way shall be maintained by the planning authority.  I do not have any issue with Deputy Ryan's proposal and I am, therefore, proposing to accept it, even though he is not here.  I am not sure if Deputy Ryan can move it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#X00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Deputy Eamon Ryan's notes are still here and I would say he is coming back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#X00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Okay.

Accordingly, for the moment at least, I am opposing it.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 96 relates to the definition of the term \"strategic housing development\" in section 3 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act.

This is already clear from the existing definition and, accordingly, I oppose the amendment on the grounds that the proposed additional wording is not necessary.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 98, section 28(2) of the 2006 Act amends section 42 of the principal Act to provide that a second extension of duration of permission may be granted by a planning authority in the case of a housing development comprising 20 houses or more where the authority considers that a further extension is necessary to enable the development to be completed.  This removes the requirement to go through the planning process again and aims to expedite the completion of the housing developments in question.  It is a temporary provision which, when commenced, will limit any such extension to no later than 31 December 2021, the end of the Rebuilding Ireland policy timeframe.  Amendment No. 98 tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Broin proposes to remove this provision entirely, as the sole purpose of section 28(2) is to provide, albeit on a temporary basis, for a second extension of permission for housing developments to support and expedite the completion of much needed housing.

If people are going to put a serious development together, there must be a pre-planning discussion between the local authority and the developer to make sure that the planning application is of a sufficient quality, that it has a reasonable chance of success and that it is consistent with local area plans and so on.  For the first time, we are actually introducing a mandatory timeframe for that.  Developers have said to me that when they look for a meeting they are being given a date six weeks away.  Developers are trying to get funding for the development and so on.  There is an onus here on developers to have a much higher standard of application that they need to get right through this pre-planning process and there is also an obligation on the system, that is the planning authority, to meet people in a timely manner and give them the guidance and instruction that comes from that so that we can have a more streamlined, predictable and better planning system.

It is one of the issues I raised when we were dealing with the general strategic housing development legislation last year.  One issue I have is that there are good local authorities that try to expedite the meetings for pre-planning as quickly as possible.  One of the complaints they often have is that the information they receive from the applicant comes very late.  Therefore, the ability for the local authority to have their planners, road planners and whoever else to review the information to make the pre-planning meeting as productive as possible is limited.

Deputy Coppinger is right in that there was a moratorium on recruitment for a number of years for understandable reasons but that is no longer in place.  We are asking local authorities to do much more in the housing and development area generally.  It is not the case for all local authorities because, from a development point of view, Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick and other cities are progressing at a different pace from other parts of the country, but we are trying to make sure that the human resources are in place to be able to respond.  There is not only that issue but there also needs to be an understanding within local authorities that they cannot simply move at their own pace, that priority needs to be given to matters and that there is a reason timelines are in place.  If there is a genuine problem meeting that timeline because of staffing resources, I need to know about it and we need to help them on that.  There also needs to be a mindset that takes on board that we are setting timelines for a reason and that there needs to be an efficiency in management to deal with that.  Some local authorities are good at that and others on which we get feedback suggest there is room for improvement.

They comprise seven amendments and they all relate to the environmental impact assessment screening that was agreed by the Oireachtas before Christmas.  The Minister will recall when we had that discussion we were dealing with a major Bill and I had a series of quite technical amendments around the environmental impact assessment screening sections of it.  I withdrew those but said I would return to the issue at this stage.  Before I speak to each amendment, my general concern is that the more I have looked at this since December, the more I have become concerned that what we agreed in the Oireachtas in December is not compliant with key aspects of the Aarhus Convention or, crucially, the 2014 environmental impact assessment directive.  When we discussed some of these issues previously the Minister rejected some of the proposals I made because he said they ran counter to the intention of the Bill, which was to try to make sure that these decisions could be taken as quickly as possible.  The difficulty, however, is that if we have agreed legislation and it is not compliant - my considered view is that it is not compliant with the most recent directive - we could end up getting bogged down in legal challenges to planning related or environmental impact assessment related decisions that could end up being counter to the intention of the original legislation that the Minister proposed.  I am more convinced than I was in December that there are significant issues here.  I am also concerned that the environmental impact assessment directive 2014 has not been transposed yet and I assume the deadline for that will not be met.  That creates some ambiguities in the legislation.  <\/p><p>I will deal briefly with each of the seven amendments.  Amendment No. 90 proposes to insert the 2014 environmental impact assessment directive into that section of the legislation to make it clear that it is one of the reference points for the implementation of the legislation.  Amendment No. 91 has four paragraphs.  Paragraph (a) relates to new information arising from the 2014 directive which needs to be taken into account in environmental impact assessment screenings.  Paragraph (b) deals with a typographical error.  I seek to substitute the words &quot;the authority may do either or both&quot; in the section I seek to amend with the words &quot;the authority shall&quot;.  Paragraph (c) deals with an issue I raised previously concerning the need for greater opportunities for public engagement and public consultation with the screening process not only by ordinary members of the public but also by organisations that may not be on the proscribed list such as environmental non-governmental organisations etc.  Paragraph (d) deals with an issue we discussed previously relating to the returning of the fee to the applicant.  It does not make sense to return the fee because if an application is rejected on the basis that it was of poor quality, the fee should not be returned.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 92 would broaden the eligibility of individual members of the public or environmental NGOs to bring decisions to the board for review.  Paragraph (b) of the amendment concerns the right to conduct a judicial review, if required.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 93 addresses an issue in requiring the board to publish decisions, first, and also, crucially, the reasons by which it came to them.  That is very important.  If somebody is going to seek a judicial review of a decision, he or she has eight weeks in which to do so.  If the reasons for the decision are not published, the only recourse for individuals or organisations is to make an access to information on the environment request which can take up to four weeks.  That cuts down on the time available to consider what are very technical sets of issues.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 94 and 95 pertain to the requirement for screenings in seeking extensions of planning permission.  I had a big problem the last time and I am more concerned about the issue now.  If somebody is applying for an extension of planning permission, there could have been significant contextual, environmental changes in the immediate area or other developments since the period in which planning permission was originally granted.  There would, therefore, be a requirement for rescreening to take the new circumstances into account.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 95 is in respect of public participation, the need for submissions, facilities to appeal to the board and, crucially, giving local authorities discretion to take some decisions on whether an extension of planning permission should be granted.  This is provided for in subsection (1) of the amendment.  Rather than stating they \"shall\" grant, the amendment proposes to use the word \"may\", depending, for example, on proper planning or whether they are unacceptable environmental impacts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#Z03800","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>As this is quite a technical area, I will refer to my notes.  <\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 90 to 93, inclusive, and amendment No. 97, tabled by Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, all pertain to new environmental impact assessment, EIA, screening provisions under the new sections 176A, 176B and 176C of the principal Act, as inserted by section 26 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  I am opposing amendment No. 90.  Section 1A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 contains a table listing the EU directives which are given effect in full or in part, where appropriate, by the Act.  Amendment No. 90 proposes to include references to two directives, Directive 2011\/92\/EU and the directive of 2014 which amended it.  I am opposing the amendment on two grounds.  First, the environmental impact assessment directive is already included in the table in section 1A.  Section 2 of the 2000 Act provides that the environmental impact assessment directive means Directive No. 2011 of the European Parliament and the Council of December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.  Therefore, amendment No. 90 is unnecessary.  Second, it is premature to include a reference to the new 2014 EIA directive, as it has not yet been transposed into national law.  On this basis, I am obliged to oppose the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 91 proposes a number of amendments to section 176A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  Paragraph (a) of the amendment proposes to substitute the existing paragraph (e) of section 176A(3) of the 2000 Act, as amended, with a new paragraph (e) to indicate that the Minister shall, by regulations, prescribe the information without specific reference to information required under the EIA directive, as amended, which should be included in the application for EIA screening.  It is premature to include a reference to the new directive at this time as the 2014 directive which includes details of information required to be submitted for EIA screening purposes in annex 11(a) has not yet been transposed into national law.  It is premature to list the directive in section 1(a) at this time.<\/p> <p>  The provisions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of amendment No. 91 appear to have the purpose of including mandatory public participation in the EIA screening process to be carried out by both planning authorities and the board.  I am opposed to these provisions because public participation for screening purposes is not a requirement of the EIA directive, either in the 2011 version or the 2014 amended directive.  There is already provision for public participation in processing substantive applications for development consent.  Instead, the EIA directives of 2011 and 2014 require that a screening determination be made available to the public.  This is provided for in sections 176B(5) and 176C(9) of the 2000 Act, as amended.  In this connection, I do not see the point of having separate public participation processes for the intermediary stages of the planning process that precede the substantive planning application and environmental assessment processes.<\/p> <p>  I accept the principle of the provision contained in paragraph (d) of amendment No. 91 which provides that the fee for an EIA screening application shall not be returned to the applicant where the planning authority rejects the application on the basis that it is incomplete in material detail.  The material or documentation to be included in an application is set out in subsection (3) of section 176A of the 2000 Act, as amended, and further material for inclusion in the application may also be prescribed.  It will be absolutely clear to the applicant what is required in an application.  There is no reason the applicant should be refunded the application fee if relevant material is omitted.  We will try to accommodate this through a change on Report Stage.  It is a fair proposal.  However, as this element forms part of amendment No. 91, other elements of which I oppose, I cannot accept it at this time.  In accordance with established practice, I ask the Deputy to withdraw amendment No. 91 on the basis that I will examine the legal and drafting aspects of the fee-related amendment proposed and will table an appropriate wording on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  These are technical and detailed amendments and I want to deal with them properly.  I oppose amendment No. 92 for the same reasons I oppose amendment No. 91.  Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 91 provides for public participation in the EIA screening process to be carried out by both planning authorities and the board.  As signalled, this is not a requirement of the EIA directive.  <\/p> <p>  I oppose amendment No. 93, as drafted, as it appears to provide that a person can appeal a determination made by the board in a review of an EIA screening decision prior to its determination by the board.  I cannot see how a determination can be judicially reviewed before it has been made.  The wording of the amendment, as drafted, would also undermine the established eight-week rule in initiating judicial reviews of decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la as provided for in section 50 of the Planning Act.  As I read it, the wording of the amendment would allow an EIA screening determination to be judicially reviewed, possibly months or even years after the screening determination, when the application for permission for development which had relied on the said screening determination was determined.  Perhaps we might talk about the wording as there seems to be a genuine concern.  However, I accept the thrust of a specific aspect of amendment No. 93 on the basis that the wording of section 176C(9) of the 2000 Act, as amended, on the board's public notice of its review of the EIA screening determination needs to be tightened to ensure all documents relevant to an EIA screening determination should be available on the board's website, in addition to being made available on the website of the relevant planning authority.  In accordance with established practice, I ask the Deputy to withdraw amendment No. 93 on the basis that I will examine its drafting aspects.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 97 relates to section 7 of the Planning and Development (Housing and Residential Tenancies) Act 2016, which sets out the provisions and timelines whereby a prospective applicant may, following a consultation meeting, request the board to determine within eight weeks if the proposed strategic housing development will require an EIA or an AA and, if so, the prospective applicant may also request the board to give an opinion within 16 weeks as to what should be contained in the environmental impact statement, EIS, and-or the Natura impact statement, NIS.  Deputy O'Broin's amendment, first, proposes to make the board's determination and opinion subject to public consultation.  The process under section 7(1)(a) is essentially a screening process, that is, the board on request confirms if an EIA or an AA is required for the proposed development and, if so, what the EIS and-or the NIS should contain.  It is not a consent process.  There is no requirement in the EIA directive for public participation in such a screening process and it is not necessary.  Public participation is provided, however, at a later stage when the planning application for the proposed strategic housing development is made to be accompanied by the EIS or the NIS, if required.  The EIA directive, both in 2011 and in 2014, requires that a screening determination should be made available to the public and should be in compliance with section 7(2)(c) of the 2016 Act by requiring that a copy of the determination should be placed and kept with the documents relating to the planning application concerned, which will be made available to the public.<\/p><p> Second, the amendment also proposes that this screening process under section 7 should take place in accordance with sections 176A, 176B and 176C of the principal Act.  Section 26 of the Planning and Development (Housing and Residential Tenancies) Act 2016 amended the principal Act by inserting these three new sections to provide for new arrangements in respect of EIA screening.  These are stand-alone provisions for EIA screening, in addition to the provision for such screening in respect of strategic housing developments as provided for in the Act.  Section 7 of the 2016 Act, as it currently stands, contains essential provisions relating to requests for EIA and AA screening within appropriate timeframes in respect of the strategic housing developments provisions.  In that context, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 94 and 95 relate to the extension of the duration of planning permissions under section 42 of the 2000 planning Act.  During the passage of the Planning and Development (Housing and Residential Tenancies) Act 2016 before Christmas, I proposed a number of amendments to the section 42 provisions, which were approved by the Oireachtas at the time.  Notably, one of the amendments inserted a new provision whereby developments that require an EIA or an AA at the time of the original permission will not qualify for an extension of duration of the permission.  This will apply to both developments where substantial work has been completed and developments where work has not commenced.  The condition is necessary to avoid an extension of time being granted for developments where, for whatever reason, an EIA or AA was required at the time of the original permission but is now out of date.  However, amendment No. 94 seeks to go even further and require that an application for an extension of duration may be granted only where the planning authority undertakes an EIA or AA screening and determines that neither assessment is required.  This goes beyond what is required in these circumstances and what was approved by the Oireachtas a few months ago.  However, I am prepared to reflect on the Deputy's comments bearing in mind that due to the often complex nature of EIA and AA requirements, it may require legal advice and further consideration and I will examine that.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 94 seeks to provide that an application for an extension of duration of the planning permission will be treated as a new EIA screening application similar to section 176A, as introduced by Planning and Development (Housing and Residential Tenancies) Act 2016.  However, unlike both sections 42 and 176A, the amendment also seeks public notice and public participation in such EIA screening applications, which is not required by the directive.  The amendment further seeks an appeal referral mechanism to the board in respect of screening where there is currently none.  I oppose the amendment as it would virtually negate the long established administrative purpose of extensions of duration, which is to allow a limited period of additional time to complete existing permissions which have been slowed down by unforeseen, mostly economic, circumstances in accordance with the terms of the original permission.  In other words, the proposed introduction of public participation as part of an EIA and AA screening process together with appeals and referrals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for applications for extensions of duration would impose an administrative burden on a process which has been adjudicated through the planning process to the extent that the extension of duration application would be more akin to a brand new planning application.<\/p><p> Having broad public consultation as part of a screening process is not required under the directive but it would potentially significantly delay the process.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.  I will, however, examine the legal issues in more detail before Report Stage and revert to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12017041200002#AA00200","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I hope \"Callan's Kicks\" was not listening to that because he would have a field day with it next Saturday.

The intention behind the Bill is the need to provide for hate crime legislation in this country.  When introducing the Bill last year I said that Ireland is behind the curve when it comes to having effective and robust legislation in place to deal with hate crimes.  Similar legislation is in place in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales - our closest neighbours - and many non-governmental organisations and voluntary bodies have been highlighting the need for hate crime legislation for many years.<\/p> <p>  The need was reinforced last month when I hosted a briefing by the National Steering Group Against Hate Crime in the Leinster House audiovisual room.  I thank committee members and other Members from both Houses who attended it.  At the meeting we heard some very moving testimonies from five different people who suffered hate crimes predicated in prejudice and hatred.  All of them were still visibly living with the consequences of that.  I again pay tribute to the people who came forward and who showed great courage in enlightening us on their experiences.  Also present at the briefing were Dr. Jennifer Schweppe and Dr. Amanda Haynes from the Hate and Hostility Research Group at the University of Limerick who are experts in this area.  I have had a number of meetings and other contacts with them in recent months.  They are considered to be international experts in the area.  They have published widely in academic and other journals on the subject.  They welcomed the introduction of a Bill on hate crime but they also had a number of concerns about the Bill that was proposed in July 2016.  Such concerns were also expressed during the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il.  At the time I undertook to look more closely at the proposed legislation and to carry out extensive consultation, which I have done, to see what we could do in terms of amendments.  On foot of these discussions I have tabled significant and far-reaching amendments to the original Bill.  It is my belief that at this point there is a majority in both Houses in favour of the introduction of hate crime legislation.  I hope the amendments will win widespread support in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I have written to the Minister seeking support for the amendments also.<\/p> <p>  While the original Bill was wide in scope, it does need to be given greater focus and more specific measures to be provided in law.  For the convenience of members, rather than attach a list of the amendments I tabled to the Bill, I have provided a revised copy of the Bill by way of post script to the statement as it would appear if the proposed amendments were agreed.  I proposed a widening of the various interpretations under the Bill to be more definitively inclusive and to address the concerns raised about addressing hate crimes through enhanced sentencing rather than by creating new offences.  I now propose to create new offences by specifically amending the following seven Acts of the Oireachtas, namely, the Criminal Justice Act 1990, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud) Offences Act 2001, the Criminal Damage Act 1991, the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  Rather than see bias and hatred as exacerbating criminal behaviour already provided for in law, these amendments will mean that hate crimes are specifically legislated for and it will also mean that hate crimes can be recorded, published and monitored, which is very important.  The amendments also provide for offences which are motivated by bias and where there is demonstration of bias in legislation, with demonstration being incorporated in cases where hate is a manifest and central basis for committing a crime.<\/p> <p>  The amendments I propose are transformative in relation to the original Bill and the Title of the Bill would be changed to the Criminal Law (Hate Crimes) Bill.  However, they will both address the concerns raised about the Bill on Second Stage and will ensure wider political support for legislation.  There is no doubt other Members may wish to submit amendments and I look forward to discussing them also.  There is an urgent need for legislation on hate crimes and I hope that together we can build a consensus across the political spectrum for it.  I look forward to the discussion and the possibility of answering any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017041200002#B00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1491991200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Loughlin.

She recognises that it can be improved.  We as a committee are happy to work with her in trying to improve it through amendments and otherwise.  It is important, however, that when we finalise a draft of a piece of legislation, we recognise that categorising a person as being guilty of a hate crime has long-term consequences and we need to give a certain amount of latitude to a court in order that when young people make a mistake and do something foolish when they are in their late teens or early 20s, they are not categorised for the rest of their lives as being somebody who has committed a hate crime.  It is important that, in the legislation, latitude is given to the courts or there is some recognition that people can make mistakes.  It is not acceptable to make such mistakes but we must recognise that there needs to be some latitude.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Loughlin for her work on the Bill.

Quite often, they have been tagged for life by the crimes that have been perpetrated on them.  I would be happy to consider a situation in which there is latitude.  I feel that in all cases the judge should have discretion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017041200002#B00600","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491991200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Loughlin for attending.  It is a good example of new politics - which generally does not work in here - that we can work together to bring forward this Bill which is in all of our interests.  A huge amount of work has been done since the Bill passed Second Stage.  It is an excellent example of the coming together of Deputies, with some interested parties in academia, to advance conditions for people living in Ireland.  It is to be welcomed.  The work done has reflected many of the concerns raised on Second Stage.  It is important we get through the scrutiny elements so we can bring it to Committee Stage.  I am conscious there was a money message attached to the Bill.  The Minister was supposed to say today if the Bill required a money message and if the Government will give one.  As a minimum we should be saying we want that, that the committee has done its homework and is only waiting for the money message so the Bill can proceed to Committee Stage.  It is important.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the issue of the new offences.  It is important that these crimes are recorded and monitored.  It is essential going forward.  There was a discussion on how the motivation of a crime might be dealt with.  Perhaps it is a debate for Committee Stage.  What is the difference, for example, between a racially motivated assault where it is quite clear the assault was initiated as a race hatred issue and an assault that is already under way when an element of racism is introduced in the middle of it?  How is that dealt with?  The fact that the person introduces racism in the course of the assault is reflective in some ways of internalised racism.  It touches on the point Deputy O'Callaghan made.  Is it just a remark in the heat of battle or is it the motivation?  How do we deal with that?  The assault itself will presumably be prosecuted but will the hate element be prosecuted?  They are the types of issues that need to be addressed.  I think we know where we are going and we can certainly do it.  <\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Loughlin for taking the time to come in today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017041200002#C00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1491991200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Four of the Private Members' Bills referred to this committee have been referred by the Office of the Ceann Comhairle because they require a money message.

To me, that means this could be more effective and more robust and has a better chance of success.  At the end of the day, that is what is important.   When we started looking at this there were three key areas that needed to be addressed.  They included determining which victim groups would be included and which needed to be protected; deciding whether the hate element would be addressed by way of aggravated offences or aggravated sentencing; and determining how hate would be established and what hate is understood to be.  The Deputy made that point.  It is quite complex.  We still have quite a bit of work to do on that.  I welcome the approach we have taken.  We are completely open to amendments and to working together to ensure this will be on the Statute Book.

The number of people who contributed on Second Stage shows how Bills can be reflective of the views of all Deputies in the House and how something positive and a framework can be established.  I commend what the Deputy organised in the AV room for victims.  It was shocking to see how imprisoned they are in their own communities and how powerless the law enforcement process is for them and how they feel there is no hope for them within society.  Hopefully this will give them something to progress very legitimate matters in their lives.  It will address circumstances in which they were seriously targeted and there was no doubt about what the issue was but that the criminal justice process, as it currently stands, could do nothing for them.  If this is progressed and we get the money message, it will do an awful lot for them.  It will give them hope and allow them to move on in some ways.  The mental trauma that people have gone through was really shocking.  Hopefully this can be progressed.  Has the Deputy had any informal indication that we may get this progressed from the Government?  Will a money message be given?  Has the Deputy had any contact?

I have a hope that it will be accepted by the Government.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy hit on an important issue of the impact of hate crime not only on individuals but on communities.  Hate crime can have a ripple effect and it can send out a message in a community that hate crime is okay.  It is sending out the completely wrong message.  It brings us back to why we should legislate for hate crime.  At the end of the day, people should not be targeted with criminal offences because of their differences, whatever those differences are.<\/p><p>Every citizen and non-citizen should feel free participate safely in all aspects of life in our country because hate crime, as much as there can be a physical impact, is also a message crime.  It gives a bad message to those who are impacted and the five people to whom I referred suffered for years afterwards in respect of how they felt about themselves, how their confidence was impacted and how they felt they were not of value to society.  It sends a dehumanising message to the victim and the community.  We have to try to eradicate that.  It is one thing to address this in legislation but we also have to try to change the hearts and minds of our people when it is enacted and to support the Garda to act in a proactive and appropriate way when such crimes are committed.

Members will be aware that it is made up of eight different Votes, with a combined gross expenditure allocation of just over &euro;2.72 billion in 2017.  That is an increase of 3.6% on the 2016 allocation of &euro;2.482 billion which was inclusive, at that point, of a gross Supplementary Estimate increase of &euro;24 million.  The gross expenditure Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vote is &euro;1.612 billion, which amounts to 64% of the funding for the entire Vote group.  The Estimate for 2017 is further increased by the additional amount of &euro;9.344 million, carried forward from 2016 under the capital carryover provisions.  The high proportion of the resources allocated to the Garda Vote outlines our commitment to having that strong and visible presence throughout the country in order to make sure that we have community engagement and reassurance and that we deter crime.<\/p> <p>  Part of our goal at present, which is very important and has been supported by this committee, is the wish to increase the overall Garda taskforce.  The commitment is to increase the number 21,000 by 2021.  That comprises 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  That reflects a commitment in the programme for Government.  In the Estimates going forward for this year, we have the money provided to fund 800 Garda recruits, 500 civilians - 300 of whom we have already advertised for - to support the wide-ranging reform in An Garda, and for 300 members of the Garda Reserve.  There has been a review of the Garda Reserve and Deputies will probably have heard those advertisements on the radio and seen them in the newspapers for the recruitment of 300 members of the Garda Reserve.<\/p> <p>  Obviously resources alone are not enough.  There are many factors.  We have been discussing some in the last few days and will continue to discuss them.  We want to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fit for purpose and can deal with the very serious gang-related crime, which everyone on this committee is very familiar with.  We need a very comprehensive range of measures to make sure that the best response possible is available.  In addition to the legislative measures, I heard this week - Deputy Jim O'Callaghan is probably familiar with this - that parts of the burglary legislation that allow for consecutive sentencing are in place now and can be used by the courts at their discretion.  Extra powers to the Criminal Assets Bureau were important as well for handling the proceeds of crime.  We have seen quite a bit happen in that area.  The second Special Criminal Court has also been established and has been hearing cases since May.<\/p> <p>  We also have, and I think it is very obvious, the establishment of the dedicated armed support unit for the Dublin metropolitan region.  That is operating on a 24-7 basis, providing appropriate armed support as required.  Since its inception, the armed support unit has been involved in high-visibility patrols.  I think people are well aware of that.  It has been involved in checkpoints and in various other difficult hostage situations, suicide incidents, executing high-risk warrants and high-risk escorts.  Over the months, it has been involved in a number of successes and has been associated with a total of 248 serious incidents in a three-month period.  Those incidents include, but are not limited to, aggravated burglary, assault, possession of or discharging a firearm, false imprisonment, immigration offences, possession of drugs for sale and supply, possession of an offensive weapon and robbery from an establishment or from a person.  The new armed support unit is out protecting the community.  We also have the Garda special crime taskforce in the Dublin metropolitan region, under the drugs and organised crime bureau.  That has been established to augment the response to organised crime at a local level through concentrated policing, and through a multi-agency approach to targeting the proceeds of crime.<\/p> <p>  The legislative measures which I have just mentioned which we put in place, targeting burglars and seizing the proceeds of crime, are equally effective in a rural context.  The measures are not only for urban areas.  Rural communities will also benefit from the significant injection of policing resources provided by the Government and the anti-crime drive which has been co-ordinated under Operation Thor, which is continuing.  Special targeted patrols are carried out with the assistance of Garda national support services against criminals who are committing crime in regions, including a recent focus on the use of motorways by criminal gangs to disrupt them if they are trying to go into a rural area to commit crime and then get away.  All of these Garda initiatives operate alongside ongoing community policing measures, including problem-solving with local communities and ongoing liaison with households in providing crime prevention advice and assistance to victims of burglary.  Garda&iacute; in local areas, as all members of this committee will be aware, and I see myself every week, are involved in working with neighbourhood groups and setting up neighbourhood watch and community alert groups throughout the country.  These are important supports for a local community and I see garda&iacute; in my own area helping local estates to set up Neighbourhood Watch groups, which I think are a very effective way of ensuring that estates are safe.<\/p> <p>  There is a capital allocation of &euro;98 million available to the garda&iacute; in 2017.  That is underpinning expenditure on ICT, which will be in excess of &euro;35 million and expenditure on buildings, which will be in the region of &euro;60 million.  Deputies will be familiar with the three headquarters which will all be finished this year.  Those are in Kevin Street, Dublin 8, Galway and Wexford.  They will be completed in the course of this year.  Under the Government&rsquo;s capital plan, &euro;46 million will be invested in a modern, effective and fit for purpose Garda fleet.  I am sure Deputies can see that the huge investment that has been made is obvious when they go around the country and see the various new vehicles that are being used.  In the two-year period 2014 to 2016, just under &euro;30 million has been spent on replacement and new vehicles for the Garda fleet.  That has been an important investment by the Government, as well as the ICT that I mentioned, which is not going to be done overnight but for which there is a programme of action.  It is the first time that we have had a committee working between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  There is a major issue with the interoperability of databases internationally.  I met the Commissioner, Mr. Julian King recently about that.  We had a very detailed discussion about the interoperability of databases and the need for Ireland to be fully up to speed on the Schengen Information System II.  We are working hard on that, since we are behind other European countries.  There is a new plan at European level for an even more sophisticated sharing of databases.  That needs to be a priority and I have emphasised that again and again to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  I published the terms of reference for the new commission yesterday.  We have had detailed discussion on that in the D&aacute;il so I will not spend time on that.  The Vote to the Policing Authority has a gross Estimate of over &euro;2.7 million, which provides for the running costs.  That will be kept under review as the authority phases up to its full staffing complement of 35.  We have said that if additional resources or expertise are necessary, they will be given.  The justice and equality Vote has a gross Estimate provision of just over &euro;444 million, broken down into five separate programmes with 60 separate subheads, reflecting the Department&rsquo;s strategy, but also the complexity of the Department and the wide range of areas that the Department has responsibility for.  I will briefly mention the various programmes and can go into more detail if Deputies would like me to.  The first is leadership in and oversight of justice and equality policy, and delivery.  That includes the Garda Ombudsman Commission, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Deputies will be aware that the Charities Regulatory Authority is now doing what I consider really excellent work, which is going to be really important in building up confidence in the charity sector again.  We know there have been very disturbing cases where charities were not operating the way they should have been.  That has dented confidence in the sector.  The Charities Regulatory Authority is now taking complaints from the public, investigating them, and now has a very good process and board in place and is getting on with that work.<\/p> <p>  On the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, there are increasing issues around the mix of data protection and privacy, and new legal frameworks are coming into place in May 2018.<\/p><p>A new e-privacy regulation is also proposed.  This area, and any necessary legislation, will be an increasing focus of the work of this committee.  In recognition of this, there is a 59% increase in the funding allocation for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  This is important in light of the challenges in this area as referenced in the report published yesterday by the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p> Programme B - A Safe and Secure Ireland - includes funding for front-line support offices such as Forensic Science Ireland, the Probation Service, services to victims of crime, including the domestic violence agencies, and for the State pathology agencies.  This programme also includes provision for crime prevention measures to support Community Alert and Crimestoppers.  Deputies may be aware that a new budget line of &euro;1 million is being provided this year for increased CCTV coverage.  I am particularly pleased that it has been possible to allocate &euro;6 million in capital funding to accelerate construction of the new Forensic Science Laboratory to be located in Backweston in County Kildare.  This should allow enabling works to commence in 2017.  This is a very necessary facility, construction of which, as I said, it is hoped will commence this year.<\/p><p> The budget for COSC is also provided for under this programme, including the media campaign around domestic violence.  I recently had a meeting with the stakeholders in this area and we are in ongoing discussion with them in regard to roll-out of the programme over the next few years.  <\/p><p> Programme C provides funding for the Legal Aid Board, the Magdalen fund and the costs associated with commissions and special inquiries.<\/p><p> Programme D deals with the migrant integration policy, which was published a few weeks ago.<\/p><p> Programme E deals with the immigration, asylum and citizenship system, including funding for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, of &euro;64.9 million and &euro;66.6 million in respect of asylum seekers accommodation for this year.  The Prison Vote is &euro;327 million, plus an additional &euro;2.833 million in unspent capital.  The Public Appointments Service launched a recruitment campaign for prison officers last year.  This was the first such campaign since 2008.  It is estimated that 80 new recruit prison officers will commence training this year and that the number of recruits in training will increase to over 200 in 2018.  This will allow the Prison Service to keep pace with expected developments.  There is also a capital provision for continued improvement of the prison estate, including major redevelopment work at Limerick and Portlaoise prisons, which is badly needed, and refurbishment works at Wheatfield, Cloverhill and Castlerea prisons.  <\/p><p> Funding for the Courts Service amounts to approximately &euro;140 million.  We all know the importance of supporting the development of new courthouses, including in relation to IT infrastructure in light of the ever increasing use of technology in our courts to ensure speedy access to justice.  In regard to the new courthouses, under a &euro;22 million public private partnership four courthouses are being constructed in Drogheda, Letterkenny, Limerick and Wexford and substantial refurbishment and extension works are being carried out to historic courthouses in Cork, Mullingar and Waterford.  This work is expected to be completed by the end of this year.  The additional capital provision in 2017 relates in the main to once-off VAT payments associated with the PPP contract, ICT fit-out costs for the new buildings and the part year payment of the annual charge for the PPP.  Additional payroll funding for staff is also provided.<\/p><p> Vote 25 deals with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which is an independent body.  Its allocation has been increased this year by &euro;300,000 to provide for additional staff to enable it to carry out its important work.  The Property Regulation Authority has a gross budgetary allocation of &euro;28 million, of which payroll accounts for approximately 84% of expenditure.  The Valuation Office has a gross allocation of 11.3 million.  This office became part of the justice group for the first time in 2016, having transferred from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Vote Group.  It is expected that following the enactment of the relevant legislation the Property Regulation Authority, the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will merge to form a new single agency.   My Department recently completed a key building block of this merger with the implementation of a national mapping agreement to provide open access for the public service to OSI's mapping products and services.

There is a slight decrease in investment this year but this is due to the fact that we brought forward some of the investment to the end of 2016.  The actual expenditure on new and replacement vehicles over the period 2013 to 2016 was in the region of &euro;40 million.  Expenditure in this area in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 was &euro;10 million, &euro;10.8 million, &euro;8.9 million and &euro;10 million.  Average expenditure in this area between 2013 and 2016 was &euro;10 million per annum as compared to an average of &euro;1.6 million between 2009 and 2011.  A huge amount of new stock was needed because of a lack of investment.  Up to this point, we have been replacing old stock with new stock.<\/p><p>The capital plan from 2016 to 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million.  That is based on the numbers of new staff that need to be brought in.  We will have an increase in the numbers of garda&iacute;, civilians and reserves.  The fleet needs have to be taken into account by reference to that as well.  Based on the expected replacement rate and the increasing demands, we have worked out a figure of &euro;46 million for the period from 2016 to 2021.  It does vary from year to year, of course, depending on the age of vehicles.<\/p><p> The Deputy is quite right in saying that we should get to a point at which we are replacing a vehicle when it reaches a particular age or mileage.  Then we will not have the huge backlog of very old fleet.  It has made things very difficult and, in some instances, there was not even fleet available, which was really serious.  The very least we have to do is invest in a suitable fleet if we expect to have effective and efficient policing.  That is the amount we expect to spend over the next five years.  I can give the Deputy some further statistics.  Having had this investment, 64% of the fleet is now less than four years old and one in five vehicles is less than one year old.  When this Government came into office, in the region of 89% of the fleet was older than four years and only one vehicle in 50 was less than one year old.  I can sent a more detailed breakdown to the committee.  The impact of the investment is clear.  The projected investment will mean a younger fleet and better availability for police.  Investment in the fleet had effectively stopped, which was obvious to everyone.  It had a huge impact on morale as garda&iacute; did not have appropriate vehicles to do their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017041200002#D00400","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>It is very welcome and certainly noticeable that the vast majority of the vehicles are less than four years old.  I would highlight in particular the high-speed response units. I have predominantly seen traffic and armed response units but I am sure there are others.  They are not just a morale booster for the garda&iacute; themselves but also for the public.  However, I notice that 31% of vehicles across the fleet are over six years; that is still a fair glut.  The figure I have in front of me indicates that only 5% of vehicles are between four and six years old.  While 64% of vehicles are less than four years old, it does appear that the majority of the remainder are over six years.<\/p> <p>  I will give the Minister an example.  There is a squad car outside Malahide Garda station on most mornings when I pass that is 11 years old.  They have brand new vehicles and other support vehicles but, while the vast majority are new or relatively new, the four to six year age bracket is at 5% while I have a figure of 573 vehicles over six years old.  Those are squad cards, marked or unmarked.  I would have a slight concern about the reliability of those vehicles.  They tend to have higher mileage.

It will have to take its place among all of the other priorities.  Obviously, safety and ensuring that it continues to be fit for purpose is the key factor.<\/p> <p>  In respect of GoSafe, the Deputy will be aware that there was a new contract for the provision and operation of a safety camera network.  That was announced in August 2016.  The contract was awarded following a public procurement competition.  The contract for the safety camera service is with Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe.  The new safety camera contract is an agreement between the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Commissioner and Road Safety Operations Ireland.  It is for six years with an option to extend for a further 12 months.  The last contract expired in November 2016.  There were some transitional arrangements that took us forward.  A review of the safety camera service was carried out prior to the end of the current contract, culminating in the recommendation in 2015 that arrangements be put in place to immediately re-tender for this service.  The review was conducted by the safety camera project board, comprising representatives of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department.  An evaluation committee was established to evaluate the tenders.  The evaluation committee included representatives from the Office of Government Procurement, the Garda, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and was chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Advice was given.<\/p> <p>  The principal objective of the road safety camera network is to change driver behaviour, making roads safer, rather than to generate revenue.  It is about safety.  GoSafe is paid based on a fixed, hourly rate for the number of hours of surveying and monitoring.  There is no financial incentive for GoSafe in increased detection rates.  That is an important point.  The new safety camera contract will be funded from traffic fixed charge notice income as is the case with the existing contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017041200002#E00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Minister covered my other question and I missed it - the point in respect of the age profile of the helicopters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017041200002#E00600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The helicopter replacement plan is in the capital review as well.

Operation Thor has provided a swift return on the Government's investment in Garda resources.  This is reflected in the official recorded crime statistics published by the CSO, which show a reduction.  Operation Thor has been a success.  There has been concentrated police activity throughout the country as a result, with 67,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide and 4,000 arrests connected to a range of offences linked to burglary, including handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drug offences.<\/p> <p>  This is an operational matter.  The Commissioner is using the required overtime for Operation Thor.  She will make her projections for the rest of this year shortly.

The waiting time is now two to three weeks.  By any criteria, that is good.  We have invested significant resources in Tipperary and extra personnel have been assigned there in recent years.  People have suggested that vetting does not need to be redone, but that carries risks where people have changed jobs.

The numbers are in the millions.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point, in that it is important that people not be inhibited in taking up jobs and that we have an efficient and effective system, but there have been major improvements.

We can try to use up the committee's time to further an agenda or we can look at the Estimates and the Votes.  I apologise for missing the start of the Minister's contribution but I am particularly interested in the IT expenditure budget.  There is a substantial figure for it.  It is a critical area, as we have seen with regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last number of months.  Will the Minister elaborate further on it and particularly on how expenditure this year might deal with some of the IT issues which have been highlighted in recent weeks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017041200002#J02000","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":532,"content":"<p>It is very critical.  We have seen with recent controversies, for example, that when they are identified one can put an IT solution in place.  Of course, one would prefer if some of those IT solutions had been there beforehand because then the problem would not have arisen in some instances.  It is one element of capturing things correctly, and it is very important.  This area was hugely neglected and there is a huge amount of work to be done on it.  It is very complex and it is central to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the reason I made it a priority.  I sought a very substantial budget of well over &euro;200 million to ensure that the various issues that need to be on the IT system could be captured.<\/p> <p>  I emphasise again the issue of the international databases which we sign up to being available here.  For example, we are behind on the Pr&uuml;m Convention.  The Schengen Information System II, SIS II, is absolutely critical in terms of data exchange across Europe, but we only started that towards the end of last year.  We are spending significant funding of &euro;20 million next year to ensure we are not in breach of European standards in regard to those.  A big part of the challenge the Garda faces is to manage and develop these IT systems.  In fact, I believe more civilian expertise is required as well, as opposed to assuming that garda&iacute; can be trained up to the level of ICT sophistication that is needed in the force at present.  Clearly, there are garda&iacute; who are specialists in this area and have developed an expertise.  We wish to use that on an ongoing basis as well.  A considerable amount of external expertise is brought in as well to ensure the systems are effective.<\/p> <p>  The Garda Inspectorate made a series of recommendations about IT and there is a programme in place to follow those.  I can give the committee some details on that.<\/p><p>When there are crises, such as there have recently been, a modernisation programme is often not spoken about but there is a wide-ranging ICT programme involving 23 initiatives, to be delivered over a five-year period.  It cannot be delivered overnight.  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 and this will lead to cutting-edge technology to deal with criminals.  There is a new investigations management system which will make sure the PULSE system contains the complete chain of events relating to an investigation and that we can manage the information gathered and decisions taken.  We used only to have the recording of the crime as the investigation was not captured on the ICT system but that is now possible.<\/p><p> There is also a new property and exhibits management system to record all property and exhibits which come into Garda possession, so that the life cycle of a drugs seizure can now be captured on the ICT system.  There is a new content management system and a single place for all documentation and multimedia content.  In the area of victim services, PULSE is being updated to include individual victim assessment and engagement screens, which will record information about victims and any Garda interaction or engagement with them, in line with the new EU victims' directive.  It also makes sure garda&iacute; get back to victims.<\/p><p> The new system will also have the right information and, rather than depending on one individual Garda to have the information, it will now be up on the screen for someone who is off duty, meaning there will be continuity of service.  There is also a new e-vetting system and a new rosters and duty management system, on which there is more work to be done.  We need to be aware where garda&iacute; are at different points and that we have real-time information about the deployment of garda&iacute; and the inspectorate wants that to be prioritised.<\/p><p> A new anti-money laundering application will support financial intelligence units to counter terrorist financing and money laundering and an updated detection system will lead to a better security architecture that proactively identifies potential threats and will ensure that policies can be put in place accordingly.  The passenger name record has to be updated and there are other systems but they could take an entire committee meeting on their own.  They are a critical part of garda infrastructure, as is how they are managed to ensure garda&iacute; keep up to date and have the expertise to required for complex systems.  This and the last Government allocated over &euro;300 million for this critical work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017041200002#J02100","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491984000,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I have received feedback from people who have said the ability of garda&iacute; to come back to them in a coherent way, across different shifts, and to update information has been transformed.

We come from the Sliabh Luachra area of County Kerry.  Sliabh Luachra is a well-known area which is renowned for music and things like that.  Some people say it is not a geographical area at all, but a state of mind and a way of looking at things.  It is a place of creativity.<\/p> <p>  One way or another, in the 1970s there were two very creative events.  One was that two brothers came together in the backyard of their house and decided to set up a joinery.  That joinery has become one of the biggest in Europe.  It presently employs 1,300 people, five miles away from our own area.  It has been a massive success.  The owners have a number of hotels as well.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, in 1975, a group of third-level students and I came together and decided it was time to launch a social group to look after people.  We created what has become known as the Social Action Group Rathmore CLG.  The purpose was to give young people a chance to become involved in community development, to make a difference in the community and to brighten up the lives of as many people as they could.  We were inspired by the old meitheal tradition.  Pat Spillane has talked about that a lot over the last number of weeks and has said that we should go back to the time of the meitheal tradition, when neighbours gathered to help neighbours.  We have been doing it successfully since 1975, but in our case it is based largely on young people - students in the secondary school - and a few adult leaders.<\/p> <p>  In the first few years we did little things like setting up a vegetable garden and selling the produce or cutting and selling turf, but one of the most important things we did was to go into the psychiatric hospital in Killarney, St. Finian's.  The whole idea was to break down barriers and remove stigmas.  We, with other groups, did that very successfully.  Before long, people were coming out to parties in Rathmore for the first time and we were going in to the hospital faithfully once a month.  It made a massive difference.<\/p> <p>  In 1981, we felt we needed out own headquarters.  We did not have any money at the time, so we approached An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na, AnCO, the predecessor of F&Aacute;S.  One of our tactics has been to approach State agencies.  They agreed to supply the manpower for our little building, our headquarters, our community centre, if I can put it that way.  Then we had to supply the money.   Our groups went north, south, east and west in cars collecting money.  They eventually made the &pound;57,000 required.  AnCo provided the labour and the building opened as our headquarters in 1983.  As part of our headquarters there was a disco room.  From the very start we felt we should create a kind of a cash cow, something that would generate a traded income.  We made hundreds and hundreds of pounds with discos that were attended by students from the local secondary school.<\/p> <p>  Around the same time, we were approached by a priest, Fr. Clifford, who was based in Killarney.  He had done a survey of the conditions of old people in the Kerry diocese.  He painted a dreadful picture of the conditions of many people who lived alone and he asked us to become involved.  It was a pretty big challenge for just a group of youngsters, myself, and maybe one or two more people, but we decided we would tackle it.  We hit on the idea of offering a service.  Immediately we decided to offer a laundry.  We contacted the Southern Health Board again.  It provided the transport and paid a person to bring the laundry to and from the homes of older people.  The youngsters did the laundry in conjunction with a local nun, Sr. Genevieve.  It worked out great.  The very first couple of weeks were tough enough because, as members of the committee can imagine, some of the clothes that came in to us could not withstand the rigours of the modern machines.  They were left in a bad state and St. Genevieve occasionally had to go to Killarney to supply new clothes.  Some old person said the nuns had great power after all because of what happened to the clothes and the, almost overnight, transformation.<\/p> <p>  That was very important because it began a hectic campaign.  The home help paid by the Southern Health Board asked us to clean and paint houses.  Eventually we went into dozens of houses and got essential repairs carried out, electricity supplied and water and toilets installed.  It was a massive campaign over a decade and made a massive difference.<\/p> <p>  In 1990, we decided that we needed to do more.  Some people were too isolated.  They were living in bad accommodation that nothing could be done with.  We decided to tackle the social housing.  We contacted Kerry County Council and got on to the Department of the Environment.  We became a registered company, got chartered status and were accepted to provide social housing.  We got a site and built our first seven houses.  We thought in the beginning that there was no way they would be filled in a rural area like ours, but when we went out looking for names we ended up with about 20.  Our job then was to decide who would be the first seven to get a house.<\/p> <p>  We then said we would keep going and we looked for another site.  Eventually in 1998 a site came up.  The man asked us for &pound;85,000.  We had no money.  We approached Clann Credo and it gave us the &pound;85,000.  We bought the site and again contacted the county council and the then Department of the Environment and Local Government.  We built our 20 houses and a very modern, large day-care centre for the elderly.  People are brought to the centre on a fleet of buses and a car and it has been a magnificent success.  Not only that, but it has generated many jobs.  Currently, we have 15 jobs of our own.<\/p> <p>  We still could not finish our waiting list.  People were wondering what the nuns would do with the local convent.  We approached them and they agreed to sell it.  About three years ago we purchased the convent from the nuns.  It is a beautiful listed building.  We developed it at a cost of &euro;1.1 million.  All of the money was generated by our own fundraising, with the help of the Ring of Kerry charity cycle, from which we got &euro;250,000.  Is that sustaining the rural community?  Obviously, it is.  We have already generated 15 jobs locally.  The man who won the contract for the convent was on the verge of collapse due to the recession.  Since December 2015 there has been on average nine people working on the project every day.  We feel that is one of the ways forward.  We work with the State agencies and they generate money for us.  We have a bit of experience now and we can make a massive difference.<\/p> <p>  As well as that, while I finish, we also decided to keep working for the young people.  We have developed Teach &Iacute;osag&aacute;in - our headquarters since 1983 - a number of times since.  We have added extensions.  It is now one of the most modern youth caf&eacute;s in the country and offers all kinds of services for young people.  Again, one of the most important services is probably the disco hall.  We do not believe in giving out money to DJs.  We create our own DJs, one teaching the other.<\/p> <p>  That is basically our story since 1975, or part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017041200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerh O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1492002900,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Donoghue very much for his opening statement.

O'Mahony, Ms Samantha O'Shea and Ms Anne Fitzgerald.  I wish to recognise all of the other members in Sliabh Luachra, especially Mr. Jerh O'Donoghue's wife, Eileen May, and his family, which has been very involved with him in the social action group.  I recognise all the other members and volunteers that are involved in Rathmore Social Action Group and in the entire Sliabh Luachra area, which encompasses the Cork side of the Blackwater River and up into Knocknagree, as far as Scartaglin on the western side and Gneevgullia.  In that entire area, the amount of voluntary assistance that has been given to the social action group and the amount of work that has been put in cannot ever have a proper value put on it because the work that is being done in the present time and that has been done in the past going back to the mid-1970s is massive.<\/p> <p>  It has made such a difference to the lives of elderly people from that area especially, which is very rural.  Like Mr. O'Donoghue said, many people's houses were not up to scratch.  People were living in conditions in which they did not have running water, bathrooms and a lot of things.  They finished up in very lonely places.  It was great that Mr. O'Donoghue and his group took them out of that scenario.  I am sure that the people that came into his houses at the start have passed on, but there are many like them still there at the present time.  It is great to see the way they are seen after with meals.  There could be brothers and sisters or an elderly man and his wife and it is great that they are looked after with meals and medical care.  I could give an example of one lady in her 50s.  She was in a very rural part of Kerry living on her own.  Her brother passed on and she was not well.  She did not have the wherewithal to look after herself properly.  Gladly, she was taken into one of the social action houses.  She was a bit unsure of herself for a while and maybe wanted to go back home, but now she is very happy and well looked after.  She is a different person totally due to all of the support she gets where she is now living.<\/p> <p>  That is one part of the work that the social action group workers carry out: providing houses for the elderly and rural people.  They also have buses going around collecting more elderly people and bringing them to the day care centre where they pass a few hours and get a meal.  The value of that is so great and means so much to the person to get out of the monotonous home life.  They meet more people like themselves.  They pass a few hours, sing a few songs and talk.  It breaks up the time for them and is very necessary.  It is to be applauded.<\/p> <p>  The workers do meals on wheels.  They take meals out to people.  They cater for the young as well with Teach &Iacute;osag&aacute;in.  They run discos.  There is a hall in which all of the community groups can have their meetings.  I am very proud when I go to other parts of the county and indeed other parts of the country, because we have more in Rathmore than I believe a lot of other rural places have.  I am very proud of that.  I am very proud of the way in which Mr. O'Donoghue goes about his business.  We listen to the Government talking about building houses.  Mr. O'Donoghue has more built with less commotion than all of the fanfare that is going on around the Government's building.  If we take our county as a whole, and the State was involved as well, there were three rural cottages built by the local authority of Kerry County Council since 2011.  That is three rural cottages in six years, compared with what we have heard this man and his group have built.  With very little fanfare or commotion, this work has been carried out in Rathmore.<\/p> <p>  They also fund-raise.  The Ring of Kerry cycle race, thankfully, has given them funding over a number of years.  They run a pantomime there.  Everyone gets involved.  There is a lot to be learnt from what they have done and from their ambitions for the future.  How can we help them as a committee?  In their strategic plan, it states that the social action group will construct a new 140-seater theatre as an extension to Teach &Iacute;osag&aacute;in.  That is a very laudable project.  How can we support the action group to help build that?  It is important to retain our culture, which we are very proud of.  When we can display it, we need a theatre like that.<\/p> <p>  They have plans for a drop-in centre for active older people to tap into their creativity.  Sadly, I feel that is something that we are losing, have lost and will continue to lose.  People in rural areas used to meet in the pub before but that is not longer possible with rules and regulations or whatever.  We are losing all of the characters and all of the voices that they were able to give to us that were handed down to them.  We need places like the drop-in centre that Mr. O'Donoghue and his group are talking about.  We need to create places like this to ensure that we do not lose the culture of the people up in the hills and the glens of Shrone, Knocknagree and Gneevgullia, the elderly people who are 70 or 80 years of age now.  The ideas their grandfathers had about rural areas were handed down to them.  We need a continuation of that.<\/p><p>If we do not find out how we got here, we certainly will not have a clue of where we are going.  I may have gone on too far.<\/p><p> The Government is talking about the possibility of purchasing unoccupied houses.  I do not know what will become of it.  Mr. O'Donoghue spoke about it and I know it is something we will be coming with.  There is a plan for the construction of four houses on the convent grounds.  Can we ask the Minister for the environment if he can help in some way to purchase the land or do something to help us?  Is there a feasibility for developing rural tourism?  We have a very rich heritage in that part of Kerry and that part of the country.  Sliabh Luachra is renowned for its music, song, set dancing and step dancing.  We need to help and develop what this group has in mind.<\/p><p> I do not want to exclude Tearmann &Eacute;anna.  It is doing much the same work and its representatives are very welcome to the committee.  We are delighted to hear from them and appreciate the work they have done and will continue to do to help the people in Galway.  If we had more of the likes of the seven witnesses before us today, the country would be a much better place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017041200002#G00300","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492002900,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an d&aacute; dhream anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.

Our struggle is something that Tearmann &Eacute;anna referred to.  There is a lot of programme money available for us to do various programmes.  We can fund-raise very well.  We can build things and organise.  Where we are struggling as an organisation is at the level of infrastructure within the organisation.  The problem is in having the core resources and funding to help us be open for business and do business, such as compliance, governance and being able to look after health and safety.  It is this core funding that we are lacking.<\/p> <p>  We can raise money to build houses and have gardens.  What nobody will give us money for is to have a business that is a social enterprise that is open for business.  That is our significant and absolute gap going forward.  There is goodwill, community spirit and a huge level of volunteering.  There is great will, but we must be able to sustain our organisation going forward with a level of core funding and be able to access that money.  No programme allows us to do that.  We are not allowed to have management fees on a HSE contract or take out some of the money to contribute towards compliance and all of the costs of doing business.  We are determined to bring our standards up and be fully compliant with the governance code for voluntary organisations.  That is not without cost.

Very wisely at the time, the Department of the Gaeltacht was giving management grants, as they called it, to these start-up co-ops.  They still exist and are still getting this core funding that the witnesses are talking about.  It certainly had a massive effect in the Gaeltacht areas.  Let us limit today's agenda to two issues and focus on them.  One issue is the need for core funding for the development of local services.  Rather than bringing all of the services in from the local big town, they could be provided from within the communities on a comprehensive basis.  They need core funding to sustain and build those services and a scheme of core funding to be provided that is not scheme specific but is for that type of general service in rural areas.  Would that be a major plus?<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of the community services programme.  I do not know if the witnesses' organisations have a community services programme.  I cannot remember if they have one or not.  It is the only programme, apart from the rural social scheme, that allows the people to stay with the organisation.  With community employment schemes, T&uacute;s schemes and so on, no sooner has an organisation got the employees than they are told they have to keep moving on, even though they are dying to stay with the organisation.  In other places in the country, people who do the kind of work that schemes do out in the countryside are actually paid.  They are paid full wages and given permanent jobs.  Therefore, these are necessary services and are not ancillary.  How important would it be for scheme jobs, T&uacute;s jobs and so on that the person would be allowed to stay on the scheme as long as they did not get full-time employment elsewhere?  Therefore, the organisation would get to hold on to the staff it has trained and built up a rapport with rather than have a constant churn of the short-term schemes.  If those two issues came out of today's meeting, would the witnesses feel it was worthwhile coming all the way up to Dublin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017041200002#J00100","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492002900,"counter":622,"content":"<p>In the case of Rathmore Social Action Group, as the committee has heard, the instigator of it was Mr. Jerh O'Donoghue.

We are talking here today about sustainability.  Without Mr. O'Donoghue, it is not sustainable.  In the absence of the kind of model that the Deputy was talking about in which there is core funding for a manager role, a chief executive or whatever the title is - somebody who can manage the day-to-day activities - it is quite likely that it will fall apart, irrespective of the best attempts of a voluntary board of directors who have full-time jobs themselves.

We are talking about sustainability.  We and Mr. Jerh O'Donoghue have discussed this issue with young people as well.  Broadband is of fundamental importance to the life of rural Ireland.  Without it, we will not have employment or young people wishing to live there or return.  It might be a bit controversial to say it but, despite the talk, post offices are of the 19th century.  We need broadband because that is what will maintain jobs in rural Ireland.<br\/><br\/>My second point might be slightly off topic.  The South Kerry Development Partnership is involved in a European programme on community-based sustainable energy.  If we look at the resources of rural Ireland, there is agriculture and tourism.  Energy is another possible resource that could be huge.  We must enable communities to have ownership of energy resources so that they are not all privately owned and often offshore owned by multinationals.  A specific request is that community-based organisations which are able to come up with a reasonable and feasible proposal in the area of renewable energy would be prioritised for grid connection.  It is a very practical thing.<br\/><br\/>I already mentioned the <i>de minimis<\/i>rules, which basically discriminate against effective organisations at community level.

As Ms Anne Fitzgerald mentioned, the request for multi-annual community support and funding is vital.  The witnesses explained that it is no bother to get projects going or to get the building up but the issue is sustaining the service.  We have learned from this meeting today and we will have to fight for funding to ensure that all the work that has been brought to this stage will be kept going.<\/p> <p>  Mr Jerh O'Donoghue and his family have given of their time, as have Mr. Michael O'Mahony, Ms Samantha O'Shea and Ms Anne Fitzgerald.  However, a day will come when they will be too busy or doing something else but the service will still be needed.  We need to impress on the Ministers and the Taoiseach of the day that funding will have to be provided.  Whatever about their ideas about what they are going to do, we must retain what we have.  We need to ensure we hold what the witnesses have obtained for us with all their sweat and blood going back over the years.  We need to ensure it is preserved and that we keep providing the service.  As long as children are being born and tomorrow comes again, the service will need to be continued.  I have got the message from all the witnesses here today.  We will have to fight tooth and nail to ensure their services are protected into the future and funding will have to be provided.<\/p> <p>  I am glad Ms Denvir raised the issue of planning.  While the witnesses were waiting outside, I raised the matter of planning.  This issue is close to my heart.  My father before me and I, since I was elected to Kerry County Council, fought tooth and nail to ensure that a young fellow or a young girl got planning permission.  It is only a small thing when one considers all the racket, all the talk about social housing and all that is going on because hardly any houses are being built anywhere.  It is hard to believe that we cannot give permission to someone in their own place to build a house to put a roof over their heads.  We have two situations obtaining now in County Kerry that are preventing youngsters from getting planning.  They have the money to build the houses themselves.  A mother of one of them was on to me again today asking what is happening.  We are stuck in a kind of limbo because they say that the national strategy and planning guidelines do not allow Kerry County Council to grant permission.  If I am worth my salt up here, I must at least fight to have those policies changed to allow the young fellow or the young girl to build in his or her own place.<\/p> <p>  I know too many valleys where the lights have gone out and the elderly people have passed on.  There is a lot of talk about keeping the scenery but, if there is not a light in the window or a house in the glen, we have nothing because we are gone dead then.  It is left to the briars, bushes and badgers and all the different species.  I always say people before anything else.  If we look back at those who came before us, they protected the area they lived in, minded it and handed it down to us.  The powers that be should depend on the locals, whether it is the farmer or another who owns the land, to look after the land and hand it down to theirs.  That is what we did ever and we make no apologies for doing it.<\/p> <p>  We have learned a lesson from the witnesses today.  We are very glad of all the work they have done.  To ensure their work continues, we must fight for multi-annual funding for such groups.  I thank them very much for coming here.  They are very busy people but we have learned quite a lot from them.

When I was the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I went over to Brussels several times when the 2007-14 Leader programme - not the present one - was coming in.  I had a modest demand, which was that the <i>de minimis<\/i>threshold would be increased to &euro;400,000.  It is ridiculous to think that giving &euro;400,000 to a group in Connemara, Rathmore or wherever would interfere with international competition.

DG Competition did not want to know although DG Agriculture was reasonably sympathetic at the time because the Commissioner was sympathetic to rural development as opposed to purely agriculture.  It is a major problem.<\/p><p>This leads me to another problem that I have found in my experience in dealing with rural development.  I do not know if the witnesses have come against it.

I think it was Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v who brought in the Pobal scheme although I am not sure.  We credit him with it in our area.  I think it is a wonderful scheme and one of the best.  Unlike the community employment scheme, people are involved for a long duration.  They can be trained and they last.  It is far superior.  Today four people were taken out of our day centre to train for the new carer's course.  They have been taken out of a centre where at least 12 people suffer from advanced Alzheimer's disease.  We have to put in people to take their place.  It is crazy.  If there were a Pobal scheme like it, where they would be with us every day, it would be far superior.  It is a good model.  Perhaps tweaking is required but it is a fantastic model for rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017041200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerh O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1492002900,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I thank the Rathmore social action group and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017041200002#M00700","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492002900,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom ar&iacute;s bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach agus leis an gcoiste ar fad as ucht an cuireadh anseo inniu, leis an Teachta &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, fear &oacute; bhaile s'againne f&eacute;in agus, go deimhin, leis an Teachta Healy-Rae.

A total of 93% of our members are in family-owned and family-run premises with relatively small businesses.  The most recent Revenue figures show that 52% of all publicans are in licence bracket 1, with a turnover of under &euro;190,000 per annum - I stress that is turnover - and 78% are between brackets 1 and 2, with a turnover of less than &euro;390,000 per annum.<br\/><br\/>The vast majority of our members live and work in the communities they serve.  In many instances their customers are not alone customers but are also neighbours and friends or the sons and daughters of neighbours and friends.  Our members are responsible citizens and members of the community in which they live and would not want in any way to be associated with any negative impact on their communities.<br\/><br\/>The question of fatalities on the road is a very emotive subject.  Many have lost lives and many families have been affected.  There is no community or sector of a community that has not been touched by a road fatality.  Our members are not immune from that and many also have been affected.  The issue of alcohol as a factor in road fatalities is also a very emotive subject and the federation is clearly on the record in saying that we do not condone drunk-driving and that the full rigours of the law should be visited on those who have been caught drunk-driving.<br\/><br\/>However difficult it may be, we need to try to take the emotion out of this discussion and look at it as objectively as possible on the basis of the evidence available.  The primary document that is currently being used in respect of this proposal is a report from the Road Safety Authority entitled, Fatal Collisions 2008-2012, Alcohol as a Factor.  It is a fairly substantial piece of work.  It is our belief that a proper analysis of that report will show that there is no justification for the measures being proposed by the Minister.  This report states that alcohol is a contributory factor in 38% of all deaths on the road.  This headline has been bandied about by many commentators in the context of the current proposal to give the impression that by implementing this legislation, this figure will be significantly reduced.  We have seen that in many articles and heard it from many commentators.  We need to analyse this figure more.  Of this 38%, 9% are pedestrians and can in no way be affected by the proposal, leaving 29% where alcohol is a factor, as per the report.<br\/><br\/>I enclose in my presentation table 28 from page 56 of the said report.  That gives the breakdown available in the various alcohol bands where alcohol was deemed to be a factor.  The first glaring figure is that in 80.4% of accidents the individuals involved were over twice the legal limit.  As we have stated, in those cases the full rigours of the law should be implemented.  If members look at the second line on the table, it shows that 4.6% of the 29% - not 4.6% of all the accidents - are in the 51-80 mg blood alcohol level bracket.  That equates to 1.3% of the total.  Of interest, and as noted by Deputy Catherine Murphy in her contribution last week, there are twice the number in the 21-50 mg blood alcohol level bracket compared with the 51-80 mg bracket.  In effect, the Minister is addressing 1.3% of total road fatalities.  Of course legislation that would reduce or eliminate the 1.3% would be welcome and justified if there were evidence that in those cases, alcohol was a determined cause of the accident.  However, there is no such evidence in this report.<br\/><br\/>In section 4.3.7 on page 53 of the report it states:<\/p><blockquote>Twenty eight (11%) of the 250 collisions cited alcohol as the sole contributory factor.  An additional 3 had alcohol and a vehicle factor noted (2 with worn tyres and 1 with other).<\/blockquote> <p>There is no evidence provided in the report to show if any of the 11%, where it says alcohol was the sole factor, were in the 51-80 mg category or indeed which category they fall into.  Looking at the level that were two and four times over the limit, it would be a fair assumption that they fall into the higher bracket.<br\/><br\/>Further on in that same page the report states, &quot;In 301 of the 330 alcohol related collisions, other behavioural contributory factors in combination with alcohol include speed, drugs, dark clothing, dangerous behaviour, fatigue and distraction.&quot;  Again, there is no evidence that alcohol was a factor, other than a presence.  The report does not say which of the other factors were relevant or to what level any of them contributed to the said accidents.  What we have in the report, based on forensic analysis, is evidence of a presence of alcohol but no evidence that alcohol is the cause.  I put it to members that those are two very different things.  It is also important to note the level of evidence regarding culpability.  The report under section 1.3 on page 14 states:<\/p><blockquote>Where culpability is cited this is <i>not judicial<\/i>culpability.  This report is focused on the pre-crash behaviour of the parties involved in the collision and not the result of a prosecution.<\/blockquote> <p>The underlining of the words &quot;not judicial&quot; is in the report and is not mine and highlights that the authors of the report were at pains to point out that factor.<\/p><p>What we are looking at here is opinion based rather than judicial based. In essence, on the basis of the above, there is no evidence to support the step being proposed by the Minister and we do not believe it will contribute to saving one life.<\/p><p> Before the committee last week, the Minister referred to an increase in fatalities on the road between 2012 and 2016 and said, \"We need to look into why this is the case\".  We do not believe too much searching is required.  Since 2012, there has been a major increase in commercial activity and there has been a significant increase in employment leading to much higher volumes of traffic on the roads.  Anyone who travels regularly, like members, can confirm this.  At the same time, there has been a corresponding significant reduction in Garda presence in the Garda traffic corps.  It is not rocket science when those two factors are put together to work out why there is an increased number of road accidents and the Minister should not need to look into why this is the case.<\/p><p> The Minister accused the federation at last week's meeting of being cynical in our opposition to this legislation.  We reject that accusation totally.  We have put our case in a reasoned and logical way to anybody we have spoken to based solely on the report that the Minister has been relying on and we have adhered to the figures in that report at all times.   We are certainly not prepared to take a lecture on cynicism from a Minister who comes into this committee and makes a virtue of doing something he says will save lives, which we dispute, while at the same time opposing a public health (alcohol) Bill), which all medical commentators can confirm will save lives, because as he says, \"of the effect it will have on retailers.  It could well put some of them out of business\". That is cynicism in the extreme.  The Minister may have more friends in the retail trade than in the pub trade, but that might be cynical of me and, therefore, I will not suggest it.<\/p><p> In any situation the penalty must fit the breach of law.  There is a graduated penalty system in place that fits the breach of law and this is true in almost all areas.  It is true not only in Ireland but across the European Union.  The Minister appears to accept a graduated penalty system is appropriate, as what he is proposing is part of such a system.  The graduated system in place is appropriate.<\/p><p> A holistic approach to all the causes of fatalities on the road needs to be put in place.   It needs to cover all the aspects covered by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, including speeding, the use of phones, drugs, alcohol, etc.  In addition, having legislation without enforcement is futile.  The Minister said he has been breathalysed twice in recent times.  I travel between 25,000 and 30,000 miles a year in my job.  I have done so for 40 years, which is the guts of 1 million miles.  I have never been breathalysed.  Over the past five years, I have travelled approximately 100,000 miles and I have been stopped twice.  There needs to be proper enforcement.<\/p><p> A forensic analysis of the RSA report does not support the proposal put forward by the Minister.  We believe that the current provisions are adequate and appropriate and should not be changed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492000800,"counter":666,"content":"<p>The Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, is the representative organisation for the publicans of Dublin.  We have 600 members who represent 80% of the pubs in our capital city.  Collectively, our members sell almost 30% of all the alcohol in the Irish on-trade and employ more than 12,000 staff.  We thank the committee for the opportunity to address it on this important topic.<\/p> <p>  The LVA fully appreciates the dangers of drink-driving and welcomes the fact the overwhelming majority of the driving public uphold the law of the land in this regard.  The association obviously does not condone drink-driving and recognises that it is a matter for each individual to make their personal arrangements to uphold the law in this regard.  We recognise that Dublin is particularly well served by both public transport and taxi availability.  Our members ensure they are informed of the late night public transport schedules, including Dublin Bus, Luas and DART, in order that they can advise customers on options.  Furthermore, the majority of our members have arrangements in place with local taxi companies to provide speedy access to taxis at peak times.  We also appreciate that, across Dublin, many customers live within walking distance of their local pubs.  Street lighting and public footpaths make this a safe option for many.<\/p> <p>  The LVA believes that the current drink-driving limits and related penalties are appropriate.  Conviction of drink-driving offences rightly brings severe sanction.  The current penalties are severe enough to provide a significant deterrent and reinforce the view that drink-driving is unacceptable.  The LVA welcomes the fact the proposed Bill plans to maintain the current drink-driving limit of 50 mg.  RSA statistics show that 80% of the car and motorcycle accidents involved drivers who were over twice the legal limit.  It seems obvious to us that regulatory and enforcement measures should be targeted at this cohort.  In addition, other factors such as speed, drugs, mobile phone use, dangerous driver behaviour, fatigue, vehicle condition and road conditions play significant roles in road fatalities.<\/p> <p>   There are three obvious routes to pursue to reduce the level of drink-driving in Ireland.  First is a study as to why the incidence of drink-driving among young drivers appears to be increasing, noting it was previously on a long-term downward trend.  Second is an enhanced, longer-term public awareness and education campaign on the dangers of drink-driving, especially targeted at those segments of the public more likely to engage in drink-driving.  Third is a consistent, high-profile Garda enforcement of the current limits.  These measures, appropriately resourced and implemented consistently over the longer term, are the most effective means of reducing drink-driving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I thank the VFI and the LVA for appearing before the committee.  My position is clear.  I am against all forms of drink-driving and I strongly favour zero tolerance.  Losing one life to drink-driving is one too many.  I will make no apology for my position.  Over the years, we have been too tolerant when it comes to drink-driving.  Thankfully, that attitude is changing.  I might not always agree with the Minister but on this occasion I fully support his efforts.  Instead of taking opposing views, I strongly advocate that both the VFI and LVA work with us to change attitudes to drink-driving.  In 2015, the number of road deaths was 162 but it jumped to 188 in 2016.  In 2016, a total of 8,063 drivers were arrested for intoxicated driving, of whom 617 were detected driving with between 51 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  That was an increase of 50% on 2015.  Between 2008 and 2012, there were 286 alcohol related fatalities, of which 19 were between 21 mg and 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood and 16 were between 51 mg and 80 mg.  Drink is a factor in 38% of all road deaths.<\/p> <p>  The proposed Bill is supported by the RSA, the Road Traffic Victims Group, the AA and the Garda.<\/p><p>Independent research from the Road Safety Authority showed that drinking is increasing among young people.  Some 81% of alcohol related deaths occur in rural Ireland.  In a national survey conducted by the Road Safety Authority in January 2017, 91% of the public supported automatic disqualification.  Support for this was 89% among urban and 93% among rural respondents.  Over Christmas 2016, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ran a six-week campaign which resulted in a 35% increase in arrests over the same period in 2015, which was significant.  This new Bill will remove the dangerous impression that people who drive over the limit are allowed to continue to drive.  A breakdown of the 2015 statistics for specimens from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety showed that 22% were under 24 years, 27% were between 25 and 34 years, and 21% were between 35 and 44 years.  That means that drivers under the age of 44 years represent 70% of specimens taken.  The figures for the age group between 45 and 54 years is 14.6%, and over 55 years was 14.9%.  The gender breakdown is 81% male and 19% female.<\/p><p> In its opening submission, the Vintners Federation of Ireland stated that we must take the emotion out of this discussion and look at the objectives.  I find this statement to be deeply flawed.  We cannot take the emotion out of this.  I have visited many homes in my constituency where people's lives have been destroyed by drink driving.  Loved ones have been killed or badly injured as a result of a driver under the influence of drink.  How can we take the emotion out of this?  I urge the Vintners Federation of Ireland to approach this issue in a different manner.  We must operate a zero tolerance attitude to drink driving and impose penalties on those who drink and drive.  We should work towards a better understanding of the cause of drink driving and educate those who still drink and drive so that they have an understanding of the danger of their actions.<\/p><p> I take issue with another part of the Vintners Federation of Ireland's opening statement which stated we have evidence of the presence of alcohol but no evidence that it is the cause of these two very serious things.  Is the Vintners Federation of Ireland serious?  I find this statement very disturbing.  How can we have a situation where alcohol is in the system of a person driving yet state that we do not know that this was the cause of the accident?  I want to hear the federation's on this.  I want to agree with the comments about taking a historic approach.  We must, as stated, look at all factors that arise in cases of road traffic accidents.  I urge it, however, to look more closely at the rising instances of drink driving and to its members to see if they have any innovative solutions to reverse this trend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#E00300","speaker":"1331","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492000800,"counter":669,"content":"<p>There is a misconception that when people are found to be over the limit, they are not automatically put off the road.  The bottom line is that people between 51 mg and 80 mg get a fixed-penalty fine and penalty points.  Everyone who is found to be over that level is automatically off the road.  That has been lost somewhere in the debate.  People give the impression that if a person is caught drink driving he or she  does not automatically lose his or her licence.  In the vast majority of cases a person does.  It is only in the 51 mg to 80 mg bracket that he or she does not.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised two other points.  One was that he wants to keep the emotion in the debate.  I do not think that will lead to either good legislation or rational thinking.  We understand the emotion.

Also, in the past five to seven years, the level of enforcement has been lower than it traditionally has been.  These two points, taken together, are a big factor.  Another factor is that the current generation are more engaged in home drinking than the previous generation and they are driving between each other's houses.

On the comment earlier, while we do not want to do so, we have to take the emotive issue out of this discussion.  I commend the witnesses on coming before us today.  I am a rural Deputy.  The media try to portray it as if it is Dublin against rural Ireland but it is an issue that affects the whole country.  We talk about dairy farmers who live a few miles out from villages but there are big towns and even Dublin where one could be living inside an urban sprawl with the pub still two miles away.  I see lately, driving through the streets of Mallow at midnight, that no taxis are available and the area with the speed limit through the town could be over three quarters of a mile long.<\/p> <p>  I am not condoning drink-driving.  As indicated in one of the reports, we have to be fair.  As Mr. Cribben said in respect of those reports, we have to be objective and the penalty must fit the crime.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in his letter to us in February, made the point that the reason he was trying to change the penalty for a person with blood alcohol content of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml to three months off the road as opposed to a fixed penalty of three penalty points and a &euro;200 fine was that people were abusing it, as if to say that there were repeat offenders.  I am going to go on the record now.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, because it is a matter for her Department, if she could give me figures to show that people who were caught with blood alcohol content between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml became repeat offenders.  In other words, did they show disregard for this legislation?  She said she was not in a position to provide that information.  It harks back to the issue that the Minister, Deputy Ross, had a knee-jerk reaction at Christmas and went gung ho on the issue without considering figures.  We see the witnesses have taken consideration already.  The vintners have provided figures that completely contradict what some of the other organisations have given us.  A real rush-job is going on here and I ask that more consideration be given to the matter.<\/p> <p>  It is hard to defend the issue, I know, but, as stated, there must be balance.  In my area, some places depend on the State.  In some villages, post offices that are dependent on State subsidies are being closed.  The local creamery branch was dependent on them to keep up with technologies.  The shopkeeper is under pressure from the multiples.  Pubs, which have no subsidies whatsoever, pay the highest tax contribution to the Exchequer and are trying to survive.  I think there should be fair deliberation on this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Have the witnesses seen business pick up in recent years?  In the context of the pub trade - this is directed at our guests from the VFI in particular - I came across the term \"staycation\" during the week.  Recent CSO household figures show that there has been an upturn in the domestic market.  Do vintners feel that there has been such an upturn?  What we are trying to do is keep pubs open.  I know they can turn to alternatives such as providing food, coffee, etc., but has there been an upturn in the drinks industry with regard to pubs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#H00200","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492000800,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Two answers could be given to that.

Was 2016 better than 2015?  Yes, by a margin of about 1% or 2%.  I think it is fair to say that I am talking globally.  There has not been an even spread across the country or even within towns.  In 2015 and 2016, we saw a marginal increase in business in the on-trade but that is coming from a situation where business had dropped by a third between 2007 and 2014.

How do they weigh that view against the fact that people continue to drink and drive?  The witnesses acknowledged there was an increase in young people drinking and driving and outlined why they thought this was the case.  I agree that the lack of enforcement and resources in the Garda traffic corps have contributed to it, and the increase in staff this year will be woefully inadequate in this regard.  There was a six-week campaign against drink-driving over Christmas, instigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but there was an increase of 35% in arrests for drunk driving in that period, so if we had the traffic corps present for 52 weeks of the year the statistics would show that drunk-driving was on the rise.<\/p> <p>  The vintners said they disputed the idea that the penalty in the new Bill would save lives, though they also said they did not condone drink-driving and that the full rigour of the law should be applied to people who do it.

Can they explain why they say that?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy referred to initiatives the witnesses had looked into, such as a rural hackney service.  I was wondering what the associations here today had contributed to road safety and I thought about the cost of soft drinks, at between &euro;4.50 and &euro;5, to which there was no reference in either of today's statements.  Several years ago there was a campaign for a free drink for a designated driver but that seems to have fallen by the wayside.  Surely, initiatives such as free soft drinks for designated drivers would go some way to alleviating the problems they face in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The only thing that is changing in this legislation is the penalty.  It remains unlawful to drink-drive if one is between 50 mg and 80 mg.  The witnesses said there was evidence of a presence of alcohol in certain accidents but that there was no evidence that alcohol was a factor.  The law of the land states that if there is evidence of the presence of alcohol and a person is above the legal limit they are breaking the law.  The statistics do not have to prove that alcohol was a factor.  If a person breaks the law by being over the limit they have broken the law.

We do not know for sure but we think one factor is that the level of enforcement in the past five or seven years has been lower than historically, meaning the next generation of drivers is more willing to take a chance.  We also think cheap alcohol has been a factor, as has more home entertainment where people have to drive between homes.  Not all the alcohol which is drunk is drunk in pubs.<\/p> <p>  We also made clear that we did not condone drink-driving and in Dublin there is no excuse for it.  Understanding what is going on with the generation of drivers aged between 18 and 27 is very important, and we should not rely on anecdote or the hearsay that is bandied about for that purpose.  We were asked why there was a 35% jump in recorded drink-driving offences last December, when the higher level of enforcement was in operation.  The answer is in the question.  It was the higher level of enforcement that led to the higher numbers.  If there was a higher level of enforcement throughout the year it is more than likely that there would be a spike in arrests for a period, following which the level of incidents would drop right down.  Long-term, higher-profile enforcement is the way to manage the drink-driving issue.  There will always be idiots willing to drink and drive but if there are high levels of enforcement and a longer-term commitment to public awareness, much of the problem will be mitigated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Keeffe said he felt the current penalties were sufficiently severe.

The vast majority of people do not drink and drive, which is evident from the number of arrests compared with the number of people on the road.  Much of the enforcement activity and public awareness focus should be on the cohort that drinks and drives.  According to the RSA, 80% of those who are caught are at double the legal limit.  They are drinking large levels of alcohol before getting behind the wheel of a car and they face higher penalties.  Being caught for drink-driving rightly attracts a severe sanction for the vast majority of people and means they are automatically off the road.  In the longer term, sustained public awareness campaigns, year in and year out, and sustained high-level enforcement are the way to go to deal with drink-driving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":706,"content":"<p>How many drinks does Mr. O'Keeffe think a person can have without their driving being impaired?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#J00600","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492000800,"counter":707,"content":"<p>We do not give any advice on this.

I was breathalysed on the way home from Leinster House one night when we had a late sitting.  It was the only time in 35 years of driving that I was breathalysed.  It was part of a Christmas campaign.  Breath-testing is carried out on a sporadic basis.  People who are at the upper end of the offending scale are not being caught.  What tends to happen is that there are drink-driving campaigns as opposed to consistent breath-testing.  I agree that we must look at the available evidence but, irrespective of what law we enact, without enforcement it does not matter if it is 120 or 150.  We are still not catching the people we should be catching.  On occasion, even when people are caught there are times when technicalities arise.  For example, in my area the machine in the Garda station was not properly calibrated and the offender got off.  There are a range of factors that must be taken into account.  We must look at the evidence in considerable detail and if it stacks up there is merit in the legislation.  The potential to save lives is the critical reason underlying the enactment of legislation such as the Bill under discussion.

Something that has been missed in the debate on young people is that the goalposts have shifted for a lot of young drivers in that since October 2010, novice drivers, learner drivers and professional drivers have a limit of 20 mg compared with 50 mg for other drivers.  Prior to that the limit was far higher and the lower limit must be factored into the debate as well.<\/p> <p>  I met a professional driver at the weekend and we were discussing the previous week.  I told him about the legislation.  He was not aware that his limit was lower than mine, as a non-specified driver.  Many people do not know the limits that apply to them, and even if they do, they do not know how alcohol intake is related to the limit.  There must be education on those issues because there is still a perception that 50 mg is a pint and a bit or that 20 mg corresponds to a bottle.  It is very different for everybody but the amount of misinformation out there is a factor in the debate.<\/p> <p>  We spoke earlier about enforcement.  The joint lowest year for fatalities on roads since records began was 2012 and that year also had the highest number of fixed penalty notices for the 51 mg to 80 mg cohort of drivers.

I do not think there is a correlation between fixed-penalty notices and fatalities because we have seen those figures fluctuate in recent years.

I am not sure I have seen any posters or information in prominent positions in bars to discourage people from drinking and driving.  Could other things be done where people might be in doubt?  How accurate are those devices that people can get to test the alcohol level before they decide to drive?

The facts and figures are open to interpretation.  The witnesses stated anecdotally that in rural areas like the one I come from there is less traffic on the roads at night.  Years ago the traffic at night was coming from and going to the pubs but now there is more traffic in the mornings.  Approximately six months ago I left a dinner dance in Carrick-on-Shannon and drove to Castlerea, over 20 miles, through two villages and past seven or eight pubs.  I left at midnight on a Saturday and met no car coming towards me.  That tells me that fewer people are going to pubs in rural areas.<\/p> <p>  We need to use more imagination.  Garda&iacute; are a very valuable resource but they should be out stopping crime.  We need to use modern technology such as the speed vans which have helped garda&iacute; ensure that many people comply with the speed limits.  People complained that small Garda stations were being closed but to me that made sense because I would prefer to see a garda in a car than sitting in a station.  There was a lot of political brouhaha about that.  We have heard about Garda cars being fitted with technology to recognise the licence plates of people who do not have a licence or insurance.  Is there anything modern technology can do to address this problem, for example, that a person cannot start their car if they have alcohol on board?  Cars now are almost like airplanes.  Are the witnesses aware of anything coming down the line that will help ensure people do not drink and drive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#O00100","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":796,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy referring to the alcolocks that prevent someone activating the vehicle if they have alcohol in their system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#O00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Yes and what are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#O00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492000800,"counter":798,"content":"<p>We are not aware of anything coming down the line, but in the same way as we are responsible for serving customers in our pub and refusing customers whom we believe to have had too much to drink, it might be useful to monitor how much alcohol people buy in supermarkets per person because a lot of drinking is being done in the home.  We have a responsibility on our premises to refuse people if we believe they have too much drink on board.  The multiples, however, do not have the same apparent responsibility.

We must not lose sight of the fact that the reason the legislation is in its current format is that people's livelihoods would not be jeopardised the morning after.  On a recent radio programme that was covering this proposed change in legislation, I heard a lady who was asked if she had ever been bagged and she said she had been one morning after.  She had been out the previous night for a few drinks with friends and went to collect the car but obviously chose the wrong time to do that because she failed the test.  At least she was able to go back to work.  She admitted she got a big fright and said that was the end of her few drinks the night before.  The morning after is a big issue.  Innocent people's livelihoods would be at stake.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy said that people drink at home where there is no control of the measure and they are not aware of how much they take or what their system is capable of.  They think when they get up the next morning that they are good enough to drive.  I have asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality whether this offence has been repeated and I cannot get an answer.  Have the people caught for three penalty points and the fine ignored the law?<\/p> <p>  Many years ago publicans were wary of garda&iacute; raiding the place because a wife rang them when her husband did not come home from the pub.  Now the husband and the wife are at home drinking, which is sad.  Younger people are adhering more to the law but they are doing doughnuts at our crossroads in rural Ireland because they have so much time on their hands and they are not in the pubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#O00900","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":804,"content":"<p>There are a few old lads doing them as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#O01000","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":805,"content":"<p>I respect the fact that the background to the legislation is to save people's livelihoods the morning after.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017041200002#O01100","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000800,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I am quite concerned about the fact that, in the context of the categories of driver to whom section 29 applies, namely, the learner, novice or professional drivers who have readings between 20 mg and 50 mg and between 50 mg and 80 mg, of the number who choose to contest the fixed penalty notice and go to court, more of those who are not in the 50 mg to 80 mg cohort of non-specified drivers choose to go to court.

We need to factor that into this debate because it was not part of the regulatory impact analysis.  I am conscious that there are people who were five or six times the legal limit, having drunk eight or ten pints, who are arrested, do the readings and go back on the road the following day and drive for months without being put off it.  I would be fearful that many of them would be on the roads much longer without coming to court as a result of this.  It has not been factored into the thinking behind the Bill.
