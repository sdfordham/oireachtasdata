I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming to the House to address this matter.  I welcome that the Minister has initiated a review of the local community and development committees, LCDCs.  They are a very important aspect of local government.  They are relatively new in that they have only been in existence for a few years, and it is timely, appropriate and right that the Minister should carry out a review.  It is important that there be substantial input from the local elected members themselves, as well as the executive in all of the 31 local authorities.  There are different views, perspectives and challenges, as well as different understandings of the function of the LCDCs and how they complement rather than duplicate services.  There will always be a tension between non-elected members and elected members in every council.  I hear from some councillors that they feel there is a certain conflict with those whom they see as non-elected people.  They may be community leaders and pillars within their own community but they are not necessarily political people with the democratic mandate county councillors have.  This is presenting a challenge.  However, this is not a bad thing.  I welcome the contributions of civic-minded and active people in the community.  That is really important but we must get the balances right.<\/p> <p>There are also issues around the funding of the LCDCs.  I refer to the transitional period for people who have come in from being community activists and who ultimately may wish to go on to seek election for any political party or none.  Some people have had to stand down and with that, one loses continuity, experience and knowledge.  In addition, there is always the ongoing challenge of funding.  I thank the Minister for coming here.  It is great and timely that he has initiated this review.  However, we need greater clarity on the terms of reference for the review and its particular focus.  I am also calling for a timeline for its delivery. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#A00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  I will put my statement on the record but will also respond to one or two of the issues Senator Boyhan raises.  I do not disagree with him.<\/p> <p>My Department provides funding to support the development of the new local and community development governance structures introduced as part of the local government reform process, namely, local community development committees and local economic and community plans.  LCDCs have been established in all 31 local authority areas and have responsibility for bringing about a more joined-up approach to local and community development in their respective areas.  A primary function of LCDCs is the development of the community elements of the local economic and community plans.  The plans seek to promote the local and community development of the relevant local authority area.  They are the primary means through which the LCDCs will develop, co-ordinate and implement a coherent approach to publicly funded local and community development.<\/p> <p>My Department is carrying out a review of the LCDC framework covering the themes of governance and structure, strategic efficiencies, participation and engagement and administrative support and development.  LCDCs have been operational for three years.  They have been involved in programme management and in the creation, adoption and early implementation of local economic and community plans.  As the term of office for members is three years, LCDCs are also currently going through the first round of rotation of membership.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael Ring:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In this context, a review of the structures is considered timely.<br\/><br\/>As stated in the terms of reference for the review, the purpose is threefold: to establish an understanding of the local community and development committee, LCDC, landscape nationwide, to identify opportunities for strengthening and enhancing LCDCs, and to make recommendations to build on existing strengths and to support the future development of LCDCs.  The overall objective is to inform the ongoing development and strengthening of the existing structures.<br\/><br\/>A steering group, led by an external chair, was formed to oversee the review which commenced in October 2017.  Members are drawn from my own Department, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, local authorities and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.<br\/><br\/>The review will culminate in a report outlining the key findings and conclusions and setting out recommendations for future development of the structures.  The work of the review group is scheduled to conclude in the first quarter of 2018 with the report to issue soon thereafter.

The medical rehabilitation unit is one of three major capital developments planned at Roscommon hospital.  The other two are an endoscopy unit, which is open and extremely busy, and a hospice care centre for which plans are progressing well.  These three projects were agreed in 2011 between the then Minister, former Deputy and now Senator James Reilly, and the hospital's management and consultants along with the air ambulance unit after the downgrading of the emergency department.  I am delighted that the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has supported the development of regional rehabilitation services, including this &euro;7.85 million project proposed for Roscommon hospital.  I understand that people from the National Rehabilitation Hospital have travelled to Roscommon hospital for meetings to progress the design aspect of the project.<\/p> <p>There is a clear demand for such as facility in the west.  Almost a quarter of patients treated in the National Rehabilitation Hospital normally reside in the HSE west region which currently lacks a dedicated rehabilitation unit.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital is the only comprehensive rehabilitation facility in the Republic of Ireland for patients with physical and cognitive impairments.  The unit planned for Roscommon will operate as a satellite centre under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Hospital and relieve pressure on existing services.  It will also allow patients to be treated in their own communities.<\/p> <p>The project will initially develop a ten-bed inpatient ward accommodation on a greenfield site on the Roscommon hospice campus.  It is expected that another ten beds will be introduced on a phased basis.  Geographically, Roscommon hospital is ideally located for this development as it is so central between the west and Dublin.  I was delighted that the project took a significant step forward more than a year ago when the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, confirmed approval &euro;1.5 million funding for planning at the official opening of the &euro;6 million endoscopy unit at Roscommon hospital.  I seek an update on this project.  Once the rehabilitation unit becomes fully operational, it will create an initial 25 jobs and up to 50 jobs when all phases are complete.  These jobs are in addition to those created during the construction phase.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#B00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It is as though Santa Claus is coming to Roscommon hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#B00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>After the National Rehabilitation Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#B00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>A Programme for a Partnership Government places a particular focus on a number of key programmes and strategies, including publishing a plan for advancing neurorehabilitation services in the community.

It provides a significant range of hospital services to patients in the region, including extended day surgery, certain acute medicine services and local injuries services.  It also provides a wide array of diagnostic services, including endoscopy, laboratory medicine, point of care testing and radiology, as well as specialist rehabilitation medicine and palliative care.  Roscommon hospital plays an essential role as part of the Saolta Healthcare Group of hospitals and will continue to do so in the future.  We know that the future growth in health care will be in the areas of chronic disease management and day surgery, diagnostics and rehabilitation.

Bangor Erris, the school that is the subject of the notice we submitted, is typical of most rural schools.  There is little point in issuing IT grants, for example, if the school cannot be kept running day-to-day.  The minor works grant should be mandatory and not dependent on the money left over at the end of the calendar year.  This principal, like many others, was depending on the grant arriving in November.  She feared that the school would not survive financially until January, when the first money of the capitation grant is due to arrive, unless the school went into an overdraft position.  She feels that she could not do this as she relies on fundraising as it stands.  <\/p><p>Bangor Erris is typical of many small rural schools.  It is parents and the people of the area who are effectively keeping the school solvent.  The capital review 2016 to 2020 states in relation to minor works grants to primary schools that it is not possible to maintain school infrastructure without the payment of the minor works grant and an annual summer works scheme grant.<\/p><p>This principal, like others, is heading into December waiting for this payment, but the school still has to pay the cleaner, the secretary, the electricity, the fire alarm service bill, the oil, the refuse bins, the photocopier, the security alarm service and monitoring, and the rising cost of school insurance without basic financial support.  This principal also cites France where the local council looks after all of these basic commodities and services for smaller schools.  Forcing a small school principal to source and maintain these services is effectively asking him or her to be a teacher, a principal and an accountant, and to be a contractor.  There is a feeling among principals of smaller rural schools that the larger the school, the more money that is available to support it.  I know the larger schools have their financial challenges as well, but how does it make sense to give a teaching principal, with 26 pupils of four different class levels in the one classroom, 15 administrative days to do his or her work but give a principal with over seven colleagues and support posts a total of 183 administrative days?  It does not tally up.  Does the Government have a strategy for helping smaller schools, often with teaching principals, who are currently facing severe financial pressure and rising administrative burdens? <\/p><p>There is a feeling that the smaller the school and the more isolated it is in the area, the more financial constraints it is under.  More and more of these schools are trying to teach multiple classes across multiple disciplines.  Primary school is hugely important for the education cycle of a child.  If the schools continue to be starved of resources, it puts families under because they cannot afford to continually pay into what is supposed to be a free education system.  It also puts teachers under pressure as they try to do their jobs and maintain everything that goes on in a school, dealing with home challenges and everything else, and try to teach children of different abilities.  Having to worry about whether they can pay the bills or not is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#B00900","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising what is a very real issue for many schools and one that I understand very well.  In a former life, I was a principal of a small school.  I understand first-hand the difficulties in trying to manage the finances, keep a school afloat, the vagaries of the various funding models and the reliance on them.  I heard a good line once when I heard somebody - I think from the INTO - say that we do not see the local garda&iacute; having to do cake sales to run the local Garda station.  There are challenges there.<\/p> <p>On the minor works grant, I am glad to confirm that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, announced yesterday minor works grants totalling &euro;28.8 million.  Schools have been notified and they will get the money in the next week.  That will be welcome.  I, too, like I am sure most politicians in the House, had a number of emails from principals in the past couple of days and weeks fretting about whether this money was going to come at all.  When he announced the minor works grants in 2017, the Minister did confirm that he would be announcing them again late in 2018.  From the Minister's perspective, it was flagged that it would be late in the year before they would be announced.  That is how it has happened.<\/p> <p>The importance of the minor works grant to schools, including smaller schools, is fully understood, notwithstanding the other significant demands on resources at this time.  The rates payable under the minor works grant are &euro;5,500 per school plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 per special needs pupil attending a special school or a special class.  Schools can use the grant for a variety of school works, including improvements to school buildings and grounds, improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment, the purchase of floor coverings and window blinds, and the purchase of IT-related equipment.<\/p> <p>I am aware that primary schools, including smaller schools, would wish to have certainty with regard to the availability of the minor works grant on an annual basis.  This is an issue that will be reviewed in the context of the Department of Education and Skills long-term infrastructural planning and the level of resources available under the Government&rsquo;s ten year public capital investment plan, which is currently under development.  The demographic pressures at both primary and post-primary level mean that the Department&rsquo;s school building programme must continue to focus on delivering additional school places.  In 2017, that building programme has successfully delivered almost 19,000 permanent school places, of which more than 13,000 are additional places, with the completion of 46 major school building projects.<\/p> <p>I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the minor works grant 2017-18.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#C00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Even if it was brought forward a month, everything would not be brought into the last couple of weeks when teachers are so busy with things like school plays, rounding off the school year with tests and everything else that needs to be done at this time.  If the grant was made available a bit earlier, it would ease that pressure.  I also think that the funding of national schools needs to be really examined in terms of the resources put in and the value we get back.

With this in mind, I compliment the garda&iacute; in the Cavan-Monaghan division, and in particular Sergeant Tony Campbell and his team, for an initiative that they have undertaken for the third or fourth year in succession with transition year students in counties Monaghan and Cavan.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was present at an event there last week which was attended by over 400 young people.  The aim of this roadshow initiative was to appeal to young drivers to slow down and be more conscious of the rules of the road.  It involved young people being presented with the stark realities of what happens from the moment a crash occurs until the road is cleared.  Presentations were made on the day by Monaghan County Council's road safety officer, local garda&iacute;, a paramedic, a consultant from Cavan General Hospital's accident and emergency department, an undertaker and a coroner.  In addition, a mother who had lost her child made a striking testimony that clearly left a lasting impression on all the students.  Those who were in attendance were struck by the real stories and experiences related to them on the day.  This template, to which no cost is attached, should be rolled out across every one of the Twenty-six Counties.  It would be beneficial for all young people.  I firmly believe it should be rolled out.  I would like the Minister to consult his Cabinet colleagues with a view to doing this.  I do not doubt that we will see the benefits of it.  This fantastic initiative would help to educate people and reduce the number of fatalities on our roads and all the heartbreak and misery that goes with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#C00600","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this matter, which unfortunately is quite topical.  I applaud his concern for road safety, which is one of my primary concerns in this portfolio.  As he has pointed out, the death toll in this country is still horrific.  I do not intend to use any clich&eacute;s when I say that even though the numbers are coming down, all road deaths are completely unacceptable, unnecessary and absolutely tragic.  I applaud the Senator for consistently raising issues of this sort in this House.  I do not in any way want to discourage the splendid initiative to which he has referred.  The question of whether the Government could fund it is a somewhat different one.  I should say that the people of Cavan-Monaghan, the garda&iacute; and everybody else should be encouraged in every possible way to pursue this initiative.<\/p> <p>We should not always look to central government for everything.  In other words, we have a strong Road Safety Authority, RSA, and - I hope - a strong unified message coming from all the political parties.  Sometimes we favour different methods, and that is fair enough, but we are all part of the drive to reduce road deaths and to promote road safety.  If there is a spontaneous voluntary effort in Cavan-Monaghan, Kerry or Donegal - it does not matter to me - we should encourage it.  I am aware that the area Senator Gallagher is talking about is particularly dangerous.  It is understandable that people in the area are deeply concerned about what is happening there.  We should not stand in the way of local communities coming together and doing things spontaneously.  This should not be done in a disorganised fashion, but in a way that raises the consciousness of people in local areas regarding the difficulties, danger spots and tragedies in those areas.<\/p> <p>Part of the impetus from central government and the RSA, which is running a huge national campaign on an ongoing basis, is to raise national awareness of the tragedies that can and should be avoided and reversed, while also taking particular and specific measures.  I believe the initiative mentioned by the Senator fits perfectly logically with that approach.  Obviously, I will have to consult the RSA in this regard.  Maybe it would be right for any issues or initiatives of this sort to be pursued in conjunction with the unstinting and relentless efforts of central government.  The road figures to which the Senator has referred are not acceptable.  No road death is acceptable.  However, we should acknowledge that the numbers at the moment are down on last year.  The reduction is not enough - nothing is enough - but it can be partly attributed to the increase in public awareness of the tragedy of road deaths and the prevention measures that are being taken by central government and local communities.<\/p> <p>In delivering on its commitment to bringing road safety into all communities, the RSA has established a nationwide road safety education service.  A team of dedicated road safety educators is available to travel to preschools, schools, colleges, communities and places of work to deliver established and effective programmes to everyone.  The programmes tackle all elements of road safety including walking, cycling, travelling by public transport and being a passenger.  They also deal with urban and rural transport issues and with safe road behaviour in general.  As part of this service, the RSA has developed a range of materials that teachers can use to educate schoolchildren about road safety as it applies to all road users.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred specifically to educating transition year students.  The RSA has made several road safety education programmes available.  All of these sustained programmes have been developed using a cumulative and evidence-based approach to learning and with the assistance of education psychologists and the RSA education team.  This year, the RSA piloted a new programme on road safety, known as Road Safety Matters, which is aimed at transition year students under the junior cycle short course.  Another specific transition year programme, known as Your Road to Safety, promotes awareness, knowledge, skills and values which create a foundation for the development of safe road users.  This programme is being substantially redesigned to reflect changes in the way young people learn.  It will be available through a virtual learning environment in 2018.<\/p> <p>The two main elements of the RSA's mobile roadshow are the shuttle and the roll-over simulator.  The overall theme of the shuttle focuses on the main causal factors for road collisions and injuries, including drink-driving, non-wearing of safety belts, speeding and driver fatigue.  Advertising and visuals that are placed inside and outside the shuttle communicate the core messages of road safety and invite visitors to learn more about their vulnerabilities as road users.  This interactive unit is accompanied by a roll-over simulator, which continues to be highly effective in encouraging people to use safety belts.  The simulator is a car body fitted to a rotating hydraulic platform.  Participants sit into the simulator and experience a half or full rotation demonstrating how it feels to be in a car when it turns over in a collision and emphasising the lifesaving benefits of seat belt use in such circumstances.  The main aim of the road safety interactive units is to give the general public and target audiences a chance to interact with various road safety campaigns and to spread the message about the importance of road safety.<\/p> <p>Teams of fully qualified teachers deliver road safety education to all visitors to RSA roadshows.  These teams are on the road throughout the year visiting schools, festivals and community groups, etc.  The RSA's efforts in educating and communicating a road safety message are supplemented by local initiatives, often organised by local authority road safety officers and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The roadshow mentioned by Senator Gallagher is an example of a local initiative that the RSA supports through its attendance when it is invited to do so.  While local roadshows perform a highly valuable service in terms of road safety education and awareness, I do not have any plans to provide funding supports to them at this time.  There is no reason for anything other than full co-operation between those involved in such efforts and the RSA.  However, we do not want to see some sort of competitive tension between them.  We are all on the same side.  Obviously, the RSA is doing a great deal of work in this regard.  The initiative referred to by the Senator is extraordinarily valuable.  I imagine those involved can co-ordinate with the RSA to get a visit from the simulator.  In my supplementary remarks, I can give the House some figures with regard to how many schools have applied for such a visit, if the Senator wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#D00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>We are running behind time as a result of the Minister's comprehensive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#D00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to the cost of this initiative.

I believe this worthwhile exercise deserves to be extended across the country.  When the Minister came to this House in July for a debate on road fatalities, we discussed the N2 between Ardee, County Louth, and Castleblayney, County Monaghan.

Last night's \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme illustrated the lack of support for carers.  Many of us are well aware of this, but it took a \"Prime Time\" programme to bring it to light for the general public and the political community at large.<\/p> <p>There are 200,000 people dedicated to caring for their loved ones.  Alarmingly, this figure is on the increase and 35% of those caring for loved ones are over the age of 85 years.  This House held a debate on the ageing population and the lack of services, especially health care.  This area is very worrying.  These carers provide over 6.5 million care hours per week to the State, free of charge.  They save the State millions of euro.  A total of 9% of these carers provide full-time unpaid care with no breaks at all.  Respite services are poorly funded or non-existent, especially for people who need 24-hour care.<\/p> <p>The RT&Eacute; programme showed some cases and we all know of examples.  There were some heartbreaking stories and some lovely ones which showed people's humanity to their loved ones.  That is not reflected in the State's care for its citizens.  The programme introduced us to Jack Brennan, a gentleman aged 85 who is caring for his wife, Bernie.  He would not put her in a care home because he loved her too much.  We also saw Jacinta Walsh from Drogheda, who is caring for her 18 year old son who has autism.  His name is Sam O'Carroll.  Sam also has other conditions.  His behaviour is unpredictable and he can be extremely violent towards her.  She has suffered serious assaults.  There is no respite care available for that lady or her family.  That is quite distressing and it is shameful that the State is not able to help her.  I would like the Minister for Health to come to the House to outline exactly what he plans to do in respect of home care hours and respite services.  Although this issue is not in the headlines like Brexit, it is part of people's daily lives and needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, published the third interim report of the commission of investigation into the mother and baby homes yesterday.  I will not go into the report, which is available for us all to read, but I have some concern at the suggestion that this work will not be completed until 2019.  That is too long to wait for many women, given their circumstances, their desire to have the truth told, to share their experiences and to have what happened to them and their children acknowledged publicly by the State.  The State was aware of this in many cases.  Therefore, it is important that justice is delivered quickly for these people.  Many of these women are in their later years and have spent their entire lives seeking justice, the truth and the opportunity to tell their stories, but most of all to be believed.<\/p> <p>It is important to think of so many broken lives, broken families, broken dreams and aspirations for their loved ones.  The State reneged on its responsibility to them and walked away.  Families failed.  There is no point laying the blame on any one side of our society because we know it involved families and institutions of the State.  We need to show compassion and some understanding of these women who were betrayed, and give them justice.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Minister is setting up a new collaborative forum with a strong voice for former residents but there have been many fora, discussions and promises and these people keep being let down.  Time is terribly important for them.  I acknowledge that the Minister has agreed that a United Nations special rapporteur be invited to Ireland to assist in responding to the issues relating to the mother and baby homes.  That is positive too, but we cannot delay any further. <\/p> <p>When preparing for Christmas, we can draw on the analogy of the Christmas story, we are asked to believe, and many of us choose to believe, of the vulnerable mother and her baby.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That vulnerability is perhaps more raw at this time of year as we celebrate Christmas and the message of Christmas.

The CSO has produced startling figures on carers under the age of 15 and over the age of 85.  This is a demographic time bomb, particularly when it comes to those caring for people with disabilities.  These carers simply have been neglected by the official social care system and I support Senator Ardagh's call for some kind of response from the Department of Health.  A home care system would go a long way towards sharing the care for these people, who are happy to care for their loved ones but do not want to, or indeed cannot, do so all by themselves.<\/p><p>The main reason I wish to speak today, however, is that I was delighted to launch yesterday the Transgender Equality Network Ireland's STAD: Stop Transphobia and Discrimination report, which was authored by Ms Jennifer Schweppe and Dr. Amanda Haynes of the hate and hostility research group in the University of Limerick.  There is no doubt but that Ireland has witnessed a momentous shift in public sentiment towards some of the most marginalised groups in society.  The Marriage Act 2015, followed swiftly by the introduction of the Gender Recognition Act in the same year, each provide evidence of a sea change in political and societal attitudes.  I pay tribute here to Senator Warfield, who drew the focus of this House to the Gender Recognition Act 2015 earlier this year.  I also recognise the work of the Leader, Senator Buttimer, in this area.  The report launched by Transgender Equality Network Ireland yesterday is a stark reminder, however, that the work is not finished.  Reading this report, I was struck by the very significant hurdles that remain to be overcome by many in the transgender community before they can enjoy widespread acceptance and inclusion.  More disturbing still is the way in which some unforgiving people choose to express their own fears and insecurities, often in the form of discrimination, vandalism, and harassment.  Some of the stories in this report would make one cry.  There is no need for this kind of behaviour.  Transgender people just want to be themselves.  Over a two-year period a total of 62 transphobic hate crimes were reported to STAD from across Ireland, including very serious offences like rape; sexual assault; causing harm; and death threats.  Transphobic language was used by the perpetrator in 40 of the crimes reported.  This is no insignificant issue: there were 909 transphobic murders across the world in this period.  <\/p><p>On foot of last week's debate on the Domestic Violence Bill, Members are aware that non-violence can very often turn to violence.  This is something we must understand but not accept.  The report details many incidents that might not amount to hate crimes <i>per se<\/i>but nevertheless constitute serious discrimination.  One does not need to be punched or struck to feel sneered at and excluded and there is obviously a knock-on effect on people's mental health.  We are talking about a small group of people and there is no need for them to be treated in this way.  The Minister should come in to talk about what plans there are for the national LGBT inclusion strategy.  I also would like to hear what he has in mind to address hate crime legislation.  I ask the Deputy Leader to consider this request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#H00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy Leader to bring in the Minister to tell us why the national children's hospital cannot be named after Dr. Kathleen Lynn.  We hear again today of further nonsense around the name Phoenix and the possibility of being sued over this by an American hospital.  I cannot understand why the hospital cannot be named after such a wonderful woman as Kathleen Lynn.  If I thought for one second that there was some reason for this then I would understand.  My own colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, wrote the Minister for Health months ago outlining the reasons why the children's hospital should be named after her so I now ask that the Minister come to the House and explain to us why this cannot be done.<\/p> <p>I also want to talk about the plight of carers and I commend RT&Eacute; on its broadcast on carers in crisis and the difficulties faced by those providing care in this State.  When I hear Fianna F&aacute;il talk about carers' hours and home help hours, I have to wonder why that party cut 32,000 hours from home help hours in County Mayo in one year alone when it was in government.  I cannot understand it.  The cumulative effect of taking home help away from the HSE; privatising it; and giving maybe three quarters of an hour, half an hour or even 15 minutes, is having a real impact on all of these carers.  One in 20 people in this country is caring for a family member.  That measure has to now be reversed.  We have to go back and admit that what was done in this respect was wrong and needs to be reversed.  There was no increase in home help hours allocated under the last budget. People are still being medically assessed as needing home care packages and yet not getting them.  This is happening right across the country but it is particularly prevalent in rural areas.  I now see that in County Mayo, applications for housing aid for older people are being refused because the carer is living with - indeed has to live with - the elderly person in question.  This is an absolutely crazy situation because the requirements are now saying that that older person has to live alone.  I ask the Minister to come to the House to clarify why it is that these things are happening.  <\/p> <p>When it comes to local authority heating grants, older people are being told that heating is not covered until the local authority grant and that they have to go to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  They then go to SEAI only to be told that they are not covered for a heating grant because this or that particular box is not ticked.  Elderly people, about whom we make platitudes time and time again, are being left in housing conditions unsuitable for them to live in, excluded from grants and denied the respite care and home help hours they need.  If we really are genuine about trying to protect our elderly people and give them what they deserve, then this matter absolutely has to be addressed, not just after it has been highlighted by \"Prime Time\" but on an ongoing basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#H00700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I greatly welcome this morning the announced expansion of Ballycroy National Park to include the wild Nephin area.

I am glad to report that 400 Irish citizens are returning home daily.  That is something which we very much welcome.  Unfortunately, many emigrants face difficulties and obstacles when they return.  That is very regrettable.  I recently heard from a gentleman who returned home to Donegal after 30 years in the US.  He had an Irish driving licence before he left and while he was in the US he had a full licence with no penalty points and had no convictions while he was there.  He told me the story of the difficulties he had.  First, he cannot exchange his US licence for an Irish one.  He went on to talk about the difficulties he has.  After driving for 40 years he has to sit a theory test and do an Irish driving test.  Another difficulty is that he lives on his own and in order to drive legally on the road, he needs to be accompanied by a qualified driver.  He also has the additional difficulty of an increased insurance premium.  <\/p> <p>This is one of many examples of obstacles we put in the way of returning emigrants.  That is very regrettable.  Having 400 Irish citizens a week returning home is a nice problem to have, but there is job of work to be done to ensure that the transition they go through when they come home is as simple as possible.  I ask the Acting Leader to bring this to Cabinet so that whatever obstacles are in the way can be put to one side in order to encourage more of our people to return home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#J00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I want to make reference to the interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes which Senator Boyhan mentioned.

This is an extremely dangerous and worrying move.  Israel's claim that Jerusalem is the complete and united capital of Israel is in violation of international law.  The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in the region as east Jerusalem is the future capital of the state of Palestine, although it is still illegally occupied by Israel.  A unilateral move by the US will have grave consequences for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process which is already on life support.  I remind Members that in October 2014, this House formally recognised Palestine as a state.

Jack Brennan looks after his lovely wife, Bernie.  Jack is in his 80s and Bernie has spent 17 years in her current condition.  He looks after her 24-7.  One would have to be made of stone not to feel upset, or even to shed a tear, for him last night or to feel the same for the other carers featured on the programme.  Carers care for family members at home for 6.5 million hours a week, saving this Government millions of euro.  The number of people who are 85 years or older and are caring for their loved ones has increased by 35% in the last year.<\/p> <p>One of the comments made last night was that the HSE should bring back its humanity.  I think that was a very good point.  Another lady said that we need to look at this because it could happen to any one of us at any time.  I speak from experience as it happened to my family recently.  We were in the fortunate position that there were several of us who could care for our loved one 24-7 but it is very difficult and very heartbreaking.  One woman's carer's allowance was reduced to &euro;8 a week because her husband had gotten a new job which paid more.  This is just not good enough.<\/p> <p>We need to have the Minister in the House at some point, whenever he is available, to have a debate about this, no more than we need a debate on the mental health budget.  That budget is more than &euro;1 billion a year and we do not know where it is being spent.  I would like to know where the HSE is spending its money.  Respite is vital for these people.  Jacinta, who was on the programme last night, spoke of a house near her that is empty and available, staffed and ready, to which Sam could go so that Jacinta could have a break.  The HSE will not pay for it.  We need to have a debate.  It should not be a debate in which we all stand up and express our horror and in which the Minister reads us a speech.  It should be a proper debate in which we burrow down through the whole topic and find out where the money is going.  I really believe that the least we can do for people caring for their loved ones at home is to give them respite so that they can continue to do the wonderful job which they do.  They are not looking for something for nothing.  They are entitled to some respite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#J00400","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I completely concur with Senator McFadden.

Later today we will hear from the Ministers responsible for the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Although I am grateful for the opportunity to have dedicated time to debate such issues in the House, I am concerned at the way in which the Government has engaged with the process to date.  It has not been in compliance with the existing rules as laid out in section 14(4) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.

They did not set out the analyses in a structured fashion which would enable the Seanad to respond to them and evaluate the work of the Government and the Ministers, as is clearly the intention of the Act.<\/p> <p>With this in mind, I communicated my concerns to the offices of the Ministers, Deputies Denis Naughten, Michael Creed, Shane Ross and Eoghan Murphy, last Thursday.

It seems that the Americans will be looking for a site in east or west Jerusalem.  The situation is inflammatory.  I do not think the US realises what will happen in this regard.  The proposed move will inflame the whole Middle East.  All the adjoining countries are opposed to it.  The Palestinians are treated so badly in Gaza and the West Bank.  Israeli settlements are being built.  It is so inflammatory at the moment.  I support the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade's statement today expressing his concern.  He has contacted the US Embassy in Dublin.  The more people who contact the embassy, the better to try to persuade the US President not to proceed with the decision to relocate the his country's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.  I do not know if he realises the consequences of his actions but I have no doubt that they will be serious and that the decision will cause further conflict.  All parties in Ireland support the two-state solution, with the Israelis and Palestinians respecting each other and eventually coming to some settlement.  However, what is proposed will drive the process relating to reaching a settlement off the rails completely and lead to conflict in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#J00700","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I welcome JETPOWER to Shannon Airport.

I noted that there was a good debate on this issue at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs this morning.  There are a few reasons why I am seeking a debate.  I will provide some facts.<\/p> <p>Figures for this year show that 89% of households are connected to the Internet.  There are 3.4 million smartphones in Ireland.  A total of 93% of those aged between 16 and 29 years of age use social networks while 60% of those aged between nine and 15 years of age use smart phones.  There are significant problems with cyberbullying.  We must make decisions and attack that.  The large multinationals operating in our country are more than welcome but we need to create some disciplinary process because this is a huge issue.  There is a major problem when people want to report cyberbullying.  There is no proper monitoring.  Cyberbullying gives rise to psychological intimidation, stress and anxiety and those who engage in it use fake names.  The Harvard Business School conducted a study and found that there is a huge level of increased anxiety among young people purely because they are on social media.  There is an onus on us to look after our people in every way we can, particularly in the context of new technologies.  Those technologies come with pluses and significant minuses.  We have a strong legal system that I support and that is based on the principle of someone being innocent until proven guilty.  Right now on social media, someone is guilty, end of story.<\/p> <p>In my youth, a journalist was somebody who wrote for a newspaper or appeared on RT&Eacute; or other national media.  Now everybody in the country is a journalist.  That is very dangerous.  I ask everybody in this House to come together and say that we need to change this for the betterment of our country and the integrity of connectivity going forward.  Let us be leaders, as we have been in the past, in developing and implementing a proper strategy.  This morning, I bought two advertisements for &euro;20.  I now have an advertisement relating to Senator Boyhan so that when someone carries out a Google search in respect of him - it is not yet true but it will be true in the next couple of hours - my name will come up.  I have also decided to buy an advertisement under the name \"Leo Varadkar\" so that my name will come up.  The reason why I am saying this so strongly and why I spent &euro;20 on it is because in the past six months I was contacted by 14 companies that informed me they had to buy their names back from Google.  That is one of the ways Google makes its money.  I contacted Google and asked what I could do about this.  I was informed that all someone can do is outbid the other person get their name or that of their company back.  I am pleading with everybody here to help resolve this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#K00400","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; ag d&uacute;il leis sin ach t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as.

I asked whether a financial value had been put on the unpaid care being given by so many people in the home, if one was to look at what it would cost to care for people in nursing homes who currently are being cared for at home, either completely by unpaid carers or by people getting the carer's allowance.

I, too, acknowledge the presence in the Public Gallery of former Senator Michael Comiskey.  I would also like to join the Cathaoirleach in offering sympathies to the families of those tragically killed in the terrible road traffic accident outside New Ross on Monday evening last.  Lily Alexander and her husband, Doug, and their two sons, Doug Jnr. and Stephen, a family from the Chicago area of the US, had travelled to Ireland to attend a family funeral.  This serves as a timely reminder to us all of the dangers of the roads as we approach the Christmas season.  I note that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was in the Seanad earlier to deal with a Commencement matter from Senator Gallagher on road safety.  Again, I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family and extended family of those killed who I understand reside in the US.<\/p> <p>In regard to the Order of Business, many Senators, led by Senator Ardagh, and including Senators Kelleher, Conway-Walsh, McFadden, Grace O'Sullivan and Mullen raised the important issue of carers.  I acknowledge the \"Prime Time\" programme last night which showed us the challenges faced by carers on a 24-7 basis.  I come from a family that has cared for elderly relatives in the home for the past number of years.  I know the challenges of caring for loved ones in terms of commitment and sacrifice.  The Government and I acknowledge that more needs to be done for carers at home.  In policy terms, there is a move away from institutions but with this comes further demands on community and home care packages.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is working to improve those packages in a comprehensive way.  <\/p> <p>In terms of the actions already taken by Government in respect of carers: &euro;728 million has been provided for carer's allowance and carer's benefit this year; the Department will pay over &euro;180 million to carers under the carer's support grant scheme, which amounts to &euro;1,700 for each recipient; and &euro;147 million has been provided in 2017 for the domiciliary care allowance.  Considerable improvements have been made for carers in recent years.  However, I acknowledge that further improvements are needed.  I will ask the Leader and the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, to facilitate a debate in this House on the issue in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#M00500","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Slovenian Delegation","time":1512556200,"counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#M00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I am sure Members will join me in welcoming a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Slovenia, led by Dr. Milan Brglez, President of the National Assembly.

I agree with the Senator that there is a lot of concern with regard to the victims and those who have suffered.  The extension is being provided to enable indepth engagement with victims and their families to ensure that their personal experiences and stories are heard and properly taken into account.  I agree with Senator Boyhan that compassion and justice must be to the fore of any investigation.  I know that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, is committed to a fair and just outcome to this investigation.  As I said, the reason for the extension is to allow more indepth engagement.  I understand that more people than anticipated have come forward.  It is important for each victim and his or her family that their story is heard and properly investigated.<\/p> <p>Senator Kelleher raised the issue of carers and she spoke about the Transgender Equality Network Ireland report launched yesterday and the importance of recognition for marginalised groups in our society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I agree with Senator Kelleher who paid tribute to all those involved in producing this report and the advocates for the LGBT community, including Senators Buttimer and Warfield.  There is no doubt that challenges remain and that continued support is necessary.  Senator Kelleher raised the question of hate crime legislation being required and a strategy for LGBT people.  I will ask the Minister to come before the House on this important issue. <\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the national children's hospital.  She asked why it could not be named after a particular person, I think it was Dr. Kathleen Lynn.  The Senator should put it down as a Commencement matter and bring the Minister to the House to respond directly to it.  I do not know the details of the matter.  The Senator also expressed her concerns about carers.  It is a matter to which the House will return in more detail for statements.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan welcomed the expansion of Ballycroy National Park in County Mayo, which has almost doubled in size.  I recognise it is an issue close to the Senator's heart given his appreciation of local history and heritage, especially his experience with Killarney national park.  I agree that our heritage, history, tradition and culture is very significant in how we protect it and make it accessible for all to enjoy.  Senator Paddy Burke also welcomed these very positive developments for Ballycroy National Park.<\/p><p>Senator Gallagher raised the matter of returning emigrants, a matter that is increasingly coming to the fore, especially as we approach Christmas when we will welcome many of our emigrants home for the festive season.  I hope that many will stay here.  We hear about the difficulties and obstacles which returning emigrants face.  The Senator gave the example of the obstacles that a returning emigrant faces when renewing a driving licence in this country.  We need a closer review of the issues and challenges faced by returning emigrants and I undertake to pass on to the Cabinet the need to review the issues and challenges that they face across the board.  It is something to which the House could return in a further, wider debate on emigrants, the diaspora and that area.<\/p><p>Senator Devine raised the matter of mother and baby homes.  She also condemned President Trump's proposal to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel.  I note the Senator's serious views.  I also note that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, moved immediately to object to President Trump's position and relayed this to the US embassy.  Senator Leyden shared this concern, as indeed did Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.<\/p><p>Senator McFadden also raised the issue of carers and her very personal experience with a former Member of this House, Senator Nicky McFadden, who we sadly lost.  Our thoughts turn to people such as Nicky at times like this but we also remember the compassion and care which Senator McFadden and her family gave to Nicky during that very tough time in their lives.  The carers issue is one to which we will return.<\/p><p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan has raised concerns about the Government's handling of the Climate Action and Development Act of 2015.  Considerable time was allowed in the House this week and last to debate this issue with the various Ministers.  The Senator will have an opportunity to seek assurance from Ministers that there will be satisfactory compliance with Irish obligations in climate action and development.  There is no doubt that Ireland is facing serious challenges in climate action.  We are behind the curve and all sections of society, from policymakers, sectors and industries down to local authorities and citizens, need to change our mindset and how we think about climate action here if Ireland is to achieve the targets and objectives which we have set ourselves.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne welcomed a new company to Shannon and the mid-west.  When new economic activity comes to the regions, it is something that is always welcome, and that is what this airport materials company will do for the mid-west.  Senator Byrne and others raised another important point about the schools minor works grants.  Senators Paddy Burke and Murnane O'Connor also spoke strongly on the need for these grants to be extended on a multi-annual basis.  This is something with which I strongly agree as someone who spent eight years as the chairperson of a national school board of management.  There is a level of uncertainty about these grants, and when the Minister next comes before the House to speak on education, we will ask that he speak on the area of sustaining facilities and infrastructure to ensure that we have appropriate primary, secondary and third level educational facilities for students.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also expressed concern about President Trump's proposal regarding Jerusalem.  We will invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter in greater detail.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is currently engaged in sensitive and critical negotiations on Brexit.  The Senator also raised the interesting issue of rickshaws in Dublin.  Those of us who reside here for a few days a week see the increase in rickshaw activity.  The Senator proposes that they be banned and says they are unregulated, which is a fair point.  It is something that the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism at Sport could consider before bringing it back to the Seanad for wider debate.  Alternatively, perhaps it is something that Dublin City Council might examine - Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in will know more about this than me - through its strategic policy committee on transport, and come to Government with recommendations on whether the area can be regulated.  I know that it concerns the Senator and many people who live in Dublin.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is a forward-looking Senator and he referred to the new challenges in the modern world of social media and the Internet.  I agree with him.  Never before have people in Ireland been more accessible through social media and the Internet.  People, including children, are accessible morning, noon and night.  We need to look in a holistic and comprehensive way at how we manage social media and Internet interaction.  The Internet is very positive in terms of communication, learning, and the platforms it provides us, but there are also challenges, including access to pornography, online intimidation and cyberbullying.  These are serious problems.  When we were growing up, if there was an issue with bullying in school, a child went home to the safety of the house and family, but now if a child is being bullied at school, that bullying can follow him or her over the Internet into his or her home and bedroom.  I understand the Senator's genuine concerns.  It is something that this House should look at and debate in more detail to see if a legal provision could be arrived at to protect those who are vulnerable to cyberbullying, and the broader area of social media.  I also note the Senator's points about advertisements and marketing.  It is a new area of which many of us might not be aware.  It is something that we should return to and I will ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to come to the House, perhaps early in the new year, for a deeper debate on the matter.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised concerns about Brexit.  He sought statements in the House and asked for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am sure the Senator will agree that the Minister is very involved in the critical and sensitive negotiations with our EU 27 partners and also the UK.  I am sure that the Minister will be happy to come to the House at the earliest opportunity.  I acknowledge all the support from parties and Independents for the Government position on Brexit at this critical time.  It is important, and the Government has been clear from the outset about its position, that there should be no hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  It is adhering to that view strongly.  We feel it is supported by the vast majority of all citizens, not only in the Republic but also on the island of Ireland.  We are determined to find a resolution and a way forward.  I wish the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, the very best in these negotiations in coming days.  They will be very sensitive days indeed.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke asked that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht be invited to the House to investigate the displacement of species due to infrastructural development.  This is something we can do.  The matter comes up frequently in planning applications and appeals.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The protection of species is important but so is the development of this country in a sustainable and coherent way.  An Oireachtas joint committee could discuss the issue in more detail.  I will ask the Minister if she can make time to come to this House to discuss the issue in more detail.<\/p><p>Senator Davitt called for the Minister for Finance to come here to review how banks are issued with licences.  He raised a number of concerns about the way banks have moved away from cash and claimed that many banks has become staffless and faceless.  I understand his concerns.  Indeed, a number of constituents in my area of Waterford recently raised serious concerns about cashless banking taking place in some towns and villages.  I would ask the banks two questions.  Is the banking system fit for purpose?  Is it what our citizens need?  We could examine the matter in more detail by either having an Oireachtas joint committee discussion or inviting the Minister to this House to debate the matter further.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield expressed his concerns about the motion tabled in the D&aacute;il regarding the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, and whether the Irish Defence Forces might be integrated into a wider EU military regime.  I wish to put the following on the record.  PESCO has no implications for Ireland's military neutrality.  The PESCO notification recognises the specific defence policies and constitutional positions of member states.  It is important to note that the participation in any project under PESCO will be decided by each member state case by case.  Therefore, PESCO would not impact on our traditional policy of military neutrality.  I have no problem inviting the Minister for Defence to the House to debate the matter in more detail and to address the concerns that the Senator is quite entitled to raise.<\/p><p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan mentioned the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  All of the Members of both House who have sat on the committee and who I believe have the best of intentions reflect various perspectives on such a sensitive issue.  We await the report with interest.  There will be adequate opportunity for all Senators to express their views about the report.  I support what has been expressed by the Senator about the Chairperson, our colleague, Senator Catherine Noone.  Allegations of bias have been made against her.  I contend that anybody who knows her will know that she is a diligent Senator who is doing her work in the best possible manner.  I believe that she is doing her work in a fair and unbiased way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#M00900","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#O00200","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I look forward to reading her report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#O00300","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Before I ask whether the Order of Business is agreed, I would like to acknowledge, particularly as a proud west Corkman, the presence in the Visitors Gallery of the All-Ireland debating champions from the Sacred Heart Secondary School in Clonakilty.

I also acknowledge the presence of Des's three grandchildren whom I am sure he would be very proud of - MaryClaire, Darragh and John Jnr.  I wish to express formally my sympathy to his family on their loss.  Today, we have an opportunity to reflect on Des's long life and pay tribute to him for his many years of public service.<\/p> <p>Des was first elected to Tipperary County Council in 1955, which is many years ago and the year I was born.  Des succeeded his father, John, who was also a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor but who died in 1953.  Thus began a long and distinguished career in politics.<\/p> <p>In 1969, Des was elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in which, with the exception of one term in the mid-1990s, he served until 2002, which is an extraordinarily long record in the Seanad.  During almost five decades of elected office, Des made his mark as a politician of deep conviction and a promoter and defender of conservative ethics at a time when the values to which he was committed, and which until then had been considered mainstream, were being questioned and challenged like never before.  He is perhaps best remembered in the public mind for the strength of his commitment to his positions on the constitutional proposals on abortion and divorce.<\/p> <p>Des's determination and fearlessness were evident in other spheres also.  He will be remembered, in particular, for the courageous stand he took about fundraising issues within his own party.<\/p> <p>Long after his departure from national politics Des remained a familiar figure to all of us here in Leinster House.  With Mona, he was a regular and popular visitor to this home from home in which both of his children were serving Members, and both with great distinction.  Mary Hanafin is also a former Minister as well.  I have had the good fortune of serving with both of the Hanafins in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>Des's career serves as an example to a younger generation of politicians who, regardless of their political outlook, have much to learn from his tenacity and sincere conviction that underpinned his approach to public life.  Des will be missed for his friendship, good humour and honesty by all of us here in Leinster House who had the privilege of knowing him.  He will be sadly missed most of all by his wife, Mona, who was his lifelong friend, pillar and soulmate, his children, Mary and John, and his three grandchildren, MaryClaire, Darragh and John Jnr.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, I must chair another meeting of the commission that was postponed earlier so I will not be in the Chair to hear the full tribute paid to Des in this Chamber.  I also acknowledge the presence of Deputy Jackie Cahill who is a proud Thurles and Tipperary man.  I am sure that everyone will have a lot to talk about during the day.  If I can get back here and leave the other meeting, I intend to return to conclude this matter.<\/p> <p>I call Senator Ardagh to commence proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#O00700","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the Hanafin family to the Seanad today.

Like many of us, he followed on a tradition started by his father.  Des's children held him in such high regard that they also followed on in his footsteps.<\/p> <p>Des was born in Thurles, County Tipperary in 1930 and he married Mona Brady in Clonmel in 1958.  He had two children who are present today - Mary Hanafin who is a former Minister and John Hanafin who is a former Senator.<\/p> <p>Des was elected to North Tipperary County Council in 1955.  He held the position of chairman of the county council in 1956.  He was subsequently elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1969 and held that position until 1992 when he lost by just one vote.  Such a loss is very hard to take but ensures one works that bit harder for the next election.  Des worked so hard that he was again elected to the Seanad in 1997.<\/p> <p>Des held very senior positions within the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation during that period and ensured the party enjoyed serious success nationally.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For this, we are all very grateful.  I learned from talking to Mary that one of her father's proudest moments was in February 2000, when she was a Minister taking legislation this House.  Her father, Des, was Senator at the time and other Senators commented and remarked that the father of the House, Des, was also the father of the Minister.  It was a lovely moment that Mary and her father were able to share.  I spoke to other former Senators today, including Olga Bennett, who have very warm memories of Des Hanafin.  Olga said she would like me to note them for the record.<\/p><p>We know Des was also a much loved grandfather.

It is very important that we acknowledge all of our visitors today, including Mary Hanafin, John Hanafin, Des's wife, Mona, and their three grandchildren, MaryClaire, Darragh and John, along with Deputy Jackie Cahill, who is here from Des's native Thurles.  Carrying on from what Senator Ardagh said, I had a particular connection with Mary Hanafin who, like John, is a legacy of Des's great political involvement.  When I was starting off as a councillor, Mary Hanafin was the local Deputy for a significant chunk of my electoral area, and she was also a Minister.  I think I was the only councillor in the country with three Cabinet Ministers in his area because we had Seamus Brennan, Tom Kitt and Mary Hanafin, who were all together at the Cabinet table at one stage.  It is a great tribute to Des that both of his children followed him into public life, as did his nephew Seamus, who served as cathaoirleach of Tipperary County Council last year and who is a serving councillor.<\/p> <p>What some people might not be so aware of is Des was a past pupil of Blackrock College.  He was a boarder there.  He followed his three brothers to the school.  He was very much influenced by his time there and by the ethos of the school.  It was a huge influence on his values and beliefs over time.  He found it particularly intriguing that when he went back to Blackrock in later years to canvass on behalf of his daughter outside the local church and in the general area, he met many other past pupils of Blackrock College.  I was not aware of this until relatively recently.<\/p> <p>Des had a very distinguished career in the Seanad.  To be fair, he was also one of the youngest councillors and one of youngest cathoairligh of North Tipperary County Council as it was at the time.  He was there before he was even 30.  He spent almost 50 years in public life.  A very small fraction of a vote was what lost him his seat on the one occasion on which he lost out, but he persevered and was back here for a distinguished period subsequently.<\/p> <p>There will be other tributes to Des later and I do not want to take from other people's contributions.  However, he was somebody who had his own difficulties and Mary certainly has acknowledged at many events that he had at difficult time with alcohol in his earlier years.  It meant he was very non-judgmental.  Even though he was very involved with the pro-life movement and the anti-divorce sentiment of the moment, he was not judgmental of other people.  He had strong views, opinions and beliefs, but he understood people who disagreed with him and he did not judge them.  It is always interesting and exciting in politics to have people who have very strong beliefs.  One might not have agreed with his views, but they were there.  He was passionate about the particular subjects with which he was involved.<\/p> <p>Des was also a loyal member of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He was one of the few people left in the country who was elected to public life when &Eacute;amon De Valera served as Taoiseach.  His father was one of the founders of the party.  Des was a significant person who, after a particular era of fundraising in the 1960s, came in and, as a significant fundraiser, had a very much more open and transparent way of raising money for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  He gave an awful lot to public life, national life, Tipperary and particularly to his family, Mona, John, Mary, his brothers and their families and his grandchildren, MaryClaire, Darragh and John.  It is nice that we are honouring him today and that his family, along with their local Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, are all here to join us.<\/p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Acting Chairman for the fact we have been given an hour in which to pay tribute to a massive figure in public life.  Very few people will ever make 30 years service in the Seanad.  Des is one of the top ten Senators in the history of the State in terms of service.  It is a record many of us would like to emulate but few of us, I am sure, will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#P00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy in respect of the late Des Hanafin.

Those views were expressed throughout the length and breadth of the country over many decades.  He raised those issues here without fear or favour and he was not afraid to raise any issue at any stage.<\/p> <p>Des was a great Fianna F&aacute;il person.  He had a very long political career, serving as a public representative for almost 50 years.  He must really have been a glutton for punishment because he contested nine Seanad elections.  He went around the country from 1960, with no phone, driving poor cars, no communications and maybe a few envelopes.  It was a great achievement to contest nine elections and to have served Seanad &Eacute;ireann for 30 years.  Before that, he was elected to serve on North Tipperary County Council.<\/p> <p>As Senator Horkan said, Des Hanafin's father was a founding member of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Des had a great association with Fianna F&aacute;il, going back to the foundation of the party.  That was carried right through and into this Chamber and he was followed here by his son, John.  I well remember serving with John in this Chamber and I recall Mary, in her various ministerial capacities, coming here on numerous occasions over a long period.  The Hanafin family has given great service, not just to Tipperary but to the country as a whole.  It has shaped the history of this country over half a century or maybe a century if we take account of Des Hanafin's father.<\/p> <p>As already stated, Des was a great contributor in this Chamber over many years.  People took heed of what he said and they listened to his words.  He was a strong individual and had a very strong voice.  We have all benefited from is strength over the years.  I offer my sympathies to his wife, Mona, to Mary and John and to his grandchildren.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#P00400","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Des Hanafin was a colourful, talented and sophisticated man.  It was an honour and pleasure for me and many other people to know and encounter him.  He had a major influence on Irish politics, particularly, but not exclusively, in the 1980s and 1990s through his support of the pro-life movement and his defence of marriage for its importance to family life and social cohesion.  What Des Hanafin promoted and defended in Irish political life may be well known, whereas why he did it is, perhaps, less so.  It is now common to decry the connection between faith and politics and to suggest that the inspiration of spiritual convictions is a poor basis to form ideas about policy and law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That analysis does not hold up logically.  Everybody, after all, has a faith in something, whether materialism or a higher power that shapes how they view things.  There is also the fact, uncomfortable for some, that most of the change makers for good in our history, however, seem to have been motivated by some higher spiritual purpose.  One thinks of William Wilberforce whose struggle against slavery drew its motivation and sustenance from his faith in an all-powerful, loving answer to the riddle of the universe.  Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Pope John Paul II, Martin Luther King - the list is endless.  In his own time and place, Des Hanafin chose a hard road of defending ideas and values that enjoyed widespread support among ordinary people but even then had many opponents in mainstream media and in the emerging new elite of Irish political and cultural life.  To his enormous credit, he did not, as other politicians may have done, instrumentalise faith or faith-inspired social policies to boost his own political standing or electability.<\/p><p>Des had already made it as a politician long before.  He did so at a very young age indeed.  He was born into, and grew up in, a Fianna F&aacute;il family in Tipperary, the sort of household that played host to rebels like Frank Ryan and Peadar O'Donnell and, as others have said, he was educated in Blackrock College.  He left early and at 21 years of age was chairman of Tipperary County Council.  Starting politics so young he could recall the founders of the State when they were in their prime.  Legend has it that he had physically to restrain Dan Breen from finishing off a man who had brought a legal action against them both.  When asked about the incident later in life, Hanafin shrugged his shoulders and said maybe he should have let Breen have his way.  I do not know whether that story is true, but it is a good one and one that he would have enjoyed telling.<\/p><p>Des had made it and made it early in politics but it was with the transformation of his life through the grace that flowed in the restoration of Mona's health and his own triumph over alcoholism that there came a new set of political priorities.  It was that sense of egalitarianism he always had.  He said of attending Blackrock College that they were the best years of his life, the only time when everyone was equal and given the same treatment.  That sense of egalitarianism blossomed in his championing of the dignity and the rights, for example, of unborn human beings.  He and others saw the way the wind was blowing internationally in the courts and legislatures of America and Europe and they saw that what was happening was no basis for a just society.  His opposition to divorce could easily be caricatured now as an unthinking defence of a law rooted in the State's strongly Catholic identity of the 1930s, but a law which undoubtedly had its roots in Catholic influence had by the 1980s and 1990s acquired a whole new social coherence of its own.  Des Hanafin, William Binchy and others were not appealing to confessional self-interest or to some tribal loyalty but to a broad understanding of the common good and the rights of children in particular.  At a time when many of the professional defenders of children's rights went missing or worse, they were concerned about how the change in divorce laws might impact on attitudes to marriage, commitment and the needs of children, and they were not proved wrong.<\/p><p>No politician is bereft of ego.  One cannot succeed in politics without a certain self-belief, and the better politicians have a sense of theatre and performance.  Des had all of those things in spades, but it took a certain death to self, a certain denial of ego, to embrace values that one knew would be good for society but which would also involve personal suffering, misrepresentation and, at times, vilification, especially when, as in Des's case, he had a taste for the bohemian life and he had very good friends in that world.  He had been a pal of The Dubliners and many great musicians, and Senator Warfield may have some of that to recall.  The 1965 Feis Ceoil was held in Thurles, largely in the marquees and main buildings of Des's Anner hotel.  He had a good voice.  I heard it on occasion and he was well fit to stop and chat with buskers because, whether it was a Taoiseach or a busker in the street, Des had the same interest in them.  He would often sing along with the buskers and would be known by them.  He had personal friendships with Luke Kelly and many others.<\/p><p>Des also became a personal friend of Pope John Paul II.  He and Mona were both honoured by Pope John Paul II, himself a giant political figure in many ways when one thinks of his impact on the fall of the Iron Curtain.  Des, being a great storyteller, was able to tell of one of the many occasions when he met the late John Paul II when the Pope actually spoke of Tipperary.  He said that the Pope said that soldiers going to war used to sing a song and he repeated what he heard with a bar of \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\".  I do not think any other politician in Irish history would have an anecdote like that but that was Des Hanafin.  He would have known Mother Teresa as well and he would have enjoyed the respect of those people for his principled and courageous approach to politics on issues in which he really and truly believed.  He was willing to pay the political price for his values.  We know that he lost his seat by a very narrow margin but later recovered it.  He would have appreciated how in his song \"My Way\", Frank Sinatra sang that he \"took the blows\", but in keeping with another Frank Sinatra song, \"That's Life\" he would have appreciated how \"You're riding high in April, Shot down in May\" but are \"back on top in June\".  That was Des's political and business story.<\/p><p>As a sane and sober man, with old world values and charm, Des could make people's day.  He made the day of a friend of mine when I brought her to hear him speak at a meeting.  He complimented her on her fine brown eyes, and it was entirely appropriate and gallant.  It was a million miles away from the seedy selfishness of a thousand political and entertainment celebrities about whom we are learning with horror these days.  Des knew his accomplishments.  He was not above rolling down the window of a car and asking a taxi driver how he had done on television the previous night or it might have been how his Mary had done on the previous night because he was deeply proud of his family and of the achievements of Mary and John.  Talent, as they proved, did not skip a generation, as it is sometimes alleged to have done with others around here, but for his wife Mona, who was honoured as he was by the Pope, it cannot always have been easy for her to have this larger than life figure in her life.  Her greatness and impact on Des's life and the lives of many other people is well known.  We sympathise with Mona, Mary and John and all the family on their loss but we also thank them for his great service to the common good.

I am sure he would be delighted to be here now, fighting the good fight again on behalf of the pro-life movement.  Des fought many battles.  I saw a statistic recently in a battle against the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.  It concerned an advertisement by the pro-life campaign saying that there are 100,000 people alive today because of the ban on abortion.  That is a legacy.  He fought for that ban.  I am sure he would be proud that the ban and the pro-life provision is still in our Constitution.

He set a huge example and it was followed by Mary and John in their public service.

In doing so I welcome his wife, Mona, his daughter, Mary, his son, John, and their families to the Chamber.<\/p> <p>As has been said, Des succeeded his father, Johnny Hanafin, on North Tipperary County Council in 1955 and went on to be the youngest council chairperson in Ireland for the following four years.  He was elected to this House in 1969 and retired from it in 2002.  The fact that he was here for almost 30 years places him, as Senator Horkan has suggested, in the top ten people who have served in the Seanad since 1922.  That is a great distinction and a great honour to have.<\/p> <p>One of his most famous political contributions to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was having been director of elections in the 1970 by-election, during which he was the director with responsibility for Donegal town.  That resulted in him achieving a phenomenal result for the party in Donegal town, so much so that it brought him to the attention of the then leader of our party, Jack Lynch, whom he continued to serve with loyalty until Jack's death.  He had the excellent help of his wife, Mona, ne&eacute; Brady, who I believe has Cavan connections, in his many election campaigns.  They divided the country up between the two of them.  As a matter of fact, on one occasion I understand that Des almost achieved two quotas and they regretted that the two of them had not run for the same panel on that occasion so that they could have served together in this House.  Mona is the only member of the family who, as of yet, has not been elected to the Oireachtas, but I would not rule it out.<\/p> <p>Des was a dogged campaigner for the issues which mattered most to him, particularly the protection of life during pregnancy, but he was at all times respectful of the views of others.  This won him respect from all sides of the House.  He was the last remaining public representative of those who were first elected under &Eacute;amon de Valera as Taoiseach.  His children, Mary and John, and his nephew, Seamus, continue his legacy in politics and service to their communities to this day, with the encouragement and assistance of their mother, Mona.  While Mary and John are both taking a short respite from these Houses, I have no doubt that they will both be back with us soon.

They have always been joyful, positive people who bring added value to life's experiences through their company in both their political life and their social, community and public life.  I acknowledge that because it is important to say.<\/p> <p>I was thinking yesterday about when I first met Des Hanafin.  I met him in the company of the great P.V. Doyle in the Burlington Hotel in the early 1980s.  I was only 20.  We were having a debate about politics.  I met him again many years later in the late 1980s after a lot of kerfuffle in Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was interesting that someone had said that Des was loyal to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Of course he was loyal to Fianna F&aacute;il, but he was never blind to political faults in anyone, including those in Fianna F&aacute;il.  To me that was the measure of the man's integrity and standing.  When I met him the second time it was at the time of the foundation of the Progressive Democrats by Des O'Malley in the late 1980s.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I remember him saying \"Be not afraid\", which always struck me as his credo.  That was his strong and continuous belief.  I met him many times after that.  He was always saying \"Ah, it'll all settle.  Be not afraid.\"  I thought it was a very courageous line - a very simple but very powerful line.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to Des but also to John, who has done an enormous work in local government and who previously served as a Senator, and to Mary, who was a great colleague and friend of mine and who has done amazing things, with children and education being the two areas that stand out.  Having been personally involved in child welfare, I can say that I have not met anybody who is more caring and compassionate about an equal start in life for children or about education.  She did enormous pioneering work as the first Minister of State with responsibility for children and produced a strategy for children in Ireland.  I acknowledge that.  Clearly, John and Mary's great love of people comes from their father and mother.  There is no question of that because their work in political life - some people might see this as a criticism but I see it as something very positive - defines them.  They do not draw a distinction between their beliefs, their education, their standing or their political lives - they embody them.  They are what they are.  There is no other side to them, which is something that comes about only rarely in politics.<\/p><p>Des was an honest and outspoken man but he was never bitter.  He was always kind.  They are the words I want to go out from here today - \"honest\", \"outspoken\", \"courageous\", \"never afraid\", \"always decent\" and \"always kind\".  He left a very special mark here and I know he left a very special mark on his family.  If we have to do anything about the legacy of people, it is to live that legacy and carry their aspirations with us.  We do so proudly and we never hide our beliefs or convictions, particularly in the context of the roles we play in our communities.  I genuinely look forward to seeing both John and Mary not only in this House but in the Lower House in the future.  I hope to see both of them back here.  I also look forward to seeing Mona, an elegant and beautiful lady, in the future.

He was a truly remarkable gentleman and a man of great integrity, fortitude and spirit.  His legacy can perhaps be best summed up by <i>The Irish Times<\/i>headline &quot;Des Hanafin: conviction politician who opposed the liberal agenda&quot; over a piece by Stephen Collins on Thursday, 22 June 2017.<\/p><p>Des was a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann for more than 30 years.  Perhaps his greatest legacy was the championing and promoting of the constitutional ban on abortion, which was passed in a 1983 referendum.  The eighth amendment of the Constitution is Ireland's original life equality amendment.  Notwithstanding the abortion legislation of 2013, the eighth amendment provides the last remaining protection for the unborn child in Ireland.<\/p><p>Des Hanafin was born in Thurles in 1930 to John, or Johnny, Hanafin, a draper and newsagent, who served for many years as a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor.  Des married Mona Brady on 28 August 1958.  Remarkably, their two children, Mary and John, went on to serve in the Oireachtas as a Deputy and Senator, respectively.  Mary, a current councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, is a former Cabinet Minister.  Today, I wish to use this opportunity, to again sympathise with Mona, Mary and John on their loss.<\/p><p>Des had a strong connection with my own county of Donegal.  That connection began in 1970, when he acted as Fianna F&aacute;il director of elections for the Donegal town area during the bye-election in the Donegal&ndash;Leitrim constituency that year.  Des forged lifelong friendships during the course of that campaign with many of the people in the Donegal town area.  Interestingly, that bye-election was won by the Fianna F&aacute;il candidate, Dr. Paddy Delap, 47 years ago last weekend.<\/p><p>Des Hanafin had a vision which recognised that if western civilisation collapsed, a brutal and pitiless world would replace it.  He also recognised that this civilisation's very survival now hangs on its ability to rediscover Christian truths and the values on which it was founded.  He was a man of immense integrity who totally disregarded self-interest and self-gain and who always served the nation and the common good.  His courageous work both within the Oireachtas and beyond it provided a beacon of light, hope and courage not only for his generation but also for the generations that followed.  The renowned Irish statesman, Edmund Burke, laid great emphasis on the transmission of values from one generation to the next and referred to a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead and those who are yet to be born.  One often wonders how many of us feel part of such a partnership?  Clearly, Des Hanafin did.  His work illustrated that fact.  Indeed, the work carried out by Des is perhaps best encapsulated by the words of Edmund Burke to the effect that all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.<\/p><p>Today, with western values and western civilisation caught in a pincer movement between radical Islam and hollowed-out secular liberalism, the ideals and courage of people such as Des Hanafin have never been more required.  However, while Des may have gone to his heavenly reward, it is up to us to carry on his legacy and work and to ensure that we can live in a country and world where the foundation of our beliefs should not be diluted into some form of empty, secular, liberal narrative in a world where things disintegrate and where the centre cannot remain intact.  The hollowing out of our institutions and our loss of identity are leading to a crisis of civilisation.  All around us we hear the distress calls but too often, we remain silent to avoid jeopardising our economic or political interests.  Des Hanafin did not take the silent path.<\/p><p>Des Hanafin's courage, determination, honesty and significant contribution to Irish public life can be summed up by a quote from the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, when he said &quot;In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principal, stand like a rock.&quot;  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#S00200","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I would also like to pay my respects to the late Des Hanafin.

I can only imagine how difficult it was to drive around the country years ago, when there were no motorways or sat navs.  Many in this room will know that it is difficult enough to find councillors at the best of times, but I cannot imagine what it would be like without motorways and sat navs.  I am sure that Des is looking down here today and is very proud of the fact that his family continue to carry the baton of political life, through Mary and John, and indeed Seamus in Tipperary.  The Hanafin family will forever be carved into Irish history, for all good reasons, and I am delighted to have the opportunity today to sympathise with Mona and the family.  I am sure that this time of year is difficult, but they can rest assured that Des and the Hanafin family will always be held in very high esteem, not just in this Chamber but indeed throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#T00100","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I also welcome Mona, Mary, John and the grandchildren of Des Hanafin, and I acknowledge the presence of Deputies Cahill and Mattie McGrath.  While I did not know Des personally, I am sure I have relayed a story about him to many people in this House on many occasions.  My grandfather died in the late 1970s and I was farmed out to live with my grandmother.  I have yet to meet a more passionate Fianna F&aacute;il woman, the Lord be good to her.  If one was a Fianna F&aacute;il public representative, one was the blue-eyed boy or girl in her eyes.  However, human nature being what it was with her, there were also some individuals whose eyes were a little more blue than others, and I remember Des Hanafin as being one of those.  I have stated on record that it was probably through those formative years of living with her that I ultimately ended up here.  My passion for and interest in politics was formed by my grandmother and her beliefs, as well as her love for Des Hanafin among many others.<\/p> <p>Without rehashing all of the kind words that have been said, one way of explaining Des and his contribution to Irish society and politics is to say that he was an extraordinary ordinary man.  I extend my sympathies to the Hanafin family.  I told my story about how my love for politics and my party started and so I also sympathise with the larger family that is Fianna F&aacute;il.  We also have lost one of our rocks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#T00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I too am pleased to pay my small tribute to the great Des Hanafin.  I extend my warmest welcome to Mona, Mary, John, MaryClaire, Darragh, John Junior and the two Tipperary Deputies who are with us here today.  Des Hanafin is a legend in Irish politics, and in particular is a legend in Fianna F&aacute;il history.  He came from a good, strong, republican Tipperary background, and that informed him throughout his political career.  I saw a photograph of him as a small boy sitting on a drum at a Fianna F&aacute;il rally.  There was a band playing and he is absolutely identifiable; he did not change one bit in the intervening half century.  I associate him with the great names of the early days of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I know that he was not in the original front rank during the War of Independence because he was not alive then, but he was very much in the tradition of de Valera, Lemass, Frank Aiken and Jim Ryan.  I am sure that even non-Fianna F&aacute;il people would accept that they were great patriots.  Des and his generation were the first generation that had to try to live up to the achievements of those freedom fighters and there is no doubt but that Des Hanafin fought a great fight for his country, his county, his party and his beliefs, both political and personal.<\/p> <p>I knew Des and had the privilege of being able to vote for him as a young county councillor on two occasions.  It is slightly ironic that I subsequently was elected to the Labour panel, for which - if my instinct is correct - a Hanafin will run on the next occasion.  I hope that I can make some small contribution to John's election campaign by not running myself.  I think that is the best thing I can do for him.  I wish him well, and wish Mary well.  People talk about political dynasties, and often use the term disparagingly, but anyone active in the political game has the highest of respect for people who were born into political households and feel the need and call of duty to continue in that.  It takes great resilience for families to stick it out.  There are ups and downs and over a long time, it is not possible to be winning all the time.  At the moment there is no Hanafin in the Oireachtas, but I believe that could change very dramatically in the next 12 months and we may have a Hanafin in both Houses.  I look forward to that prospect. <\/p> <p>It was a great honour for Des, when he was father of the House, to have Mary, as a young Minister of State, come in to address this House.  It must have been a great joy for them both.  I had great regard for Des for many reasons but when most of our erstwhile colleagues retired from the Oireachtas and subsequently dumped on the Seanad when presented with the opportunity during the referendum, Des was one of the very few former Members who came out strongly and campaigned against the abolition of the Seanad.  Many of his colleagues disappointed me at that time, but Des was four-square behind the Seanad because he realised the value of it to the body politic in Ireland. <\/p> <p>It has to be said that Des had strong principles, which one would have to admire.  He was also a man of great compassion and even though he held the strongest principles - especially on the big question of abortion - I never read anything by him that was hostile, confrontational or unpleasant to people who did not share his opinion.  That is a wonderful thing, and as we are facing into the next round of that great battle, I hope the wisdom and passion that Des displayed will obtain throughout the debate and people will respect one another's divergent views.  Everybody has an opinion and everybody tries to do what is right according to his or her own lights.  <\/p> <p>I often think that Des's compassion came from an addiction that I share with him, because I believe that when one goes through that type of thing, one thinks outside the box much more and becomes more passionate for their fellow men.  When I was at Des's funeral mass and heard Mary saying that he had not had a drink for 50 years, something changed inside me.  It inspired me greatly and I am clinging to it.  I am sure that many other people in my fix would share that.  <\/p> <p>It is a privilege to be here today to remember Des Hanafin and to remember the great days of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Without wishing to be political, I hope those days will come back to us, as long as we are inspired by people like Des Hanafin.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#T00300","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512556200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Members rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512556200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 1.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1512556200,"counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#U00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I propose the suspension of the House until the conclusion of the division in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#U00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The national newspapers have repeatedly covered the concerns regarding multinationals in Ireland.  They do not discuss tax, but rather the housing supply and the quality of life here.  This focus on tax, especially on the marginal rate, is a smokescreen.  One only has to look at the Paradise Papers to see that the super-rich will try to avoid paying any tax.  Does the Minister of State accept that Ireland is a low-tax country?

I disagree with her view.  People have heard me say many times, both here and in the other House, that the major adjustment in Irish society is the income tax take.  According to the figures up to the end of November 2017, the income tax take is &euro;18.3 billion to date.  That is with a month to go until the end of the year.  As the Senator has heard me say on multiple occasions, the low point was a take of &euro;11 billion and the expectation is that we will clear &euro;20 billion in 2017.  That has been the major adjustment and I do not apologise to anybody for giving a little bit back to working people on the lower income thresholds.  I disagree with the Senator completely on that.  An extra &euro;9 billion has been collected in income taxes and the Government proposes to give a couple of hundred million euro back to the people on low and middle rates of pay.  I do not see how Senator Conway-Walsh and Sinn F&eacute;in, who purport to be on the left and to support people on low pay and the like, can disagree with that.<\/p> <p>Regarding regional imbalance, everything that I have done since I have gone into the job I am doing in respect of financial services has been to promote the regions and rural Ireland.  The last three companies with which I have been involved in securing jobs were YapStone in Drogheda, MetLife in Galway, and Prudential in Letterkenny.  We are doing enough to reduce the regional imbalance and improve the regions as best we can.  It is the position worldwide that most companies want to go to the cities.  We are trying to work against the headwind on that and are being successful.  Perhaps we are not as successful as some people may like but there absolutely has been a change.  I must disagree completely with the Senator on the income tax take in this country. <\/p> <p>To conclude, this is a high-tax economy.  The two areas where taxes are low are the pay-related social insurance, PRSI, take and the wealth tax, that is, property tax.  Again, as Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to any changes in those, the Senator needs to have a look at her figures and at her psychology in choosing the areas to have high taxes, not at ours. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#X00700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister of State.

There has not been investment in broadband so lots of jobs are lost and we lose the tax income from those jobs.  I am not going to change the Minister of State's mind but psychologically, he really needs to consider investing in the infrastructure that people badly need.

It might be argued that this would have been Fine Gael's policy in the absence of the confidence and supply agreement.

This &euro;200 increase provides a significant benefit to small business owners across the country, including retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.  It is estimated that the credit will be of benefit in approximately 151,600 cases next year, 2018.  In view of the limited resources available in budget 2018, and all of the competing demands for amendments to the tax system, it is not possible to increase the earned income credit by &euro;450 to &euro;1,400 as proposed in the recommendation.  Such an increase would cost more than &euro;37 million in 2018 as compared with the &euro;17 million first year cost of the &euro;200 increase, which was achievable within the resources available.

However, it must be acknowledged that some of these differences are to the benefit of the self-employed.

There are significant timing benefits with regard to the payment of tax liabilities that are available to the self-assessed but not available to PAYE workers, depending on the accounting period used by taxpayers.<\/p> <p>Senators will also be aware that the overall contribution to the Social Insurance Fund by the self-employed is significantly less than that of employees as no equivalent to the employer PRSI contribution is payable.

Senators heard earlier of a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio in terms of tax cuts to increased in investment in public services but I suggest that the amount of tax cuts and reliefs in the budget is potentially far higher because the budget contains measures in respect of which we are unaware as to the likely cost to Revenue.  We do not know what the figures for tax and revenue foregone will be and such measures create a risk in terms of fiscal probity and the further hollowing out of our tax base.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is also a concern, given the commitment to equality and gender proofing of the budget, that the measures proposed under the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, disproportionately benefit those higher earners.  It will only benefit those in private companies and not those working in public services.<\/p><p>In terms of the scheme, details of which are set out in the Bill on pages 16 to 18, inclusive, I will skip the preambles and cut to what I believe is the core.  Part 3 states that as the scheme is introduced, any gain realised on the exercise of a qualifying share option after 1 January 2018 shall be exempt from income tax and shall not be reckoned in computing income for the purpose of income tax.  Effectively, this measure is taking share and stock options that are given as part of remuneration packages, which is usually done, with some exceptions, for high-earning individuals.  Those stocks and share options will not be calculated in terms of income tax but will be taken out of the normal income tax procedure.  The Minister will tell us they will be taxed in other ways later but those ways will not amount to the same procedure.  It is the less and later model of taxation we have seen in terms of share and stock options.  There is a real concern that we are moving away from recognising that somebody's package, be it a wage of &euro;150,000 and a &euro;50,000 share and stocks option, which would normally be taxed as &euro;200,000, will now be taxed at &euro;150,000 in terms of income tax and that the other &euro;50,000 may or may not, depending on what other reliefs and schemes they have, be picked up later.<\/p><p>There is also a real danger of a perverse incentive, because given this measure, it is easy to see how people may decide that they would like to have 50% of their wages paid in the form of stocks and share options, and the Bill specifically provides for that.  It provides for up to &euro;100,000 a year of stocks and share options and up to 50% of the total emoluments and total pay package over a year to be treated in this way and through this new tax relief.<\/p><p>This is a very serious concern at a time when concerns have been raised in other areas, which I will not discuss now, about some of the corporate tax and corporate welfare systems.  The concern is that we are embarking on a measure where we do not know the cost to Revenue.  The cost in the Budget Statement was &euro;10 million but it has since been clarified that that &euro;10 million is the cost of the setting up of this scheme.  That is not the cost of tax forgone.  However, we know that when IBEC lobbied for this measure two years ago, its estimate of the cost was &euro;80 million.  That is how much IBEC put on the cost of this scheme two years ago.<\/p><p>I will be opposing this section because it is badly thought through and is dangerous at a time when we are looking at great uncertainty in other areas of our taxation, including areas such as corporation tax where the international landscape is moving around us.  We should not be risking loss in this area.  I would point out again that there is a great inequity.  This is a tax measure which will only benefit those in private industry in a certain kind of private industry company.  It is not something which will be of use to low earners.  I will not make the same contribution again when opposing the section but my recommendation is simply to ask that within 13 months of the passing of this Bill, to allow for revenue to be collected for a full calendar year, the Minister might prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the total amount of revenue forgone to the Exchequer as a result of this scheme.  I welcome the fact that the Bill gives Revenue the power to ask, company by company, for figures on the total amount of tax advantage.  I would like that total amount of tax advantage that accrues to qualifying companies to be made explicitly clear, not necessarily company by company because there may be commercial sensitivity, but in terms of the total amount of tax accrued to all qualifying companies in respect of the key employee engagement programme during 2018, and for that information to be made available to us.  I ask the Minister to address that recommendation.  I will not speak at such length in terms of the opposition to the section but I will speak briefly again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#AA03200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I have a question for the Minister.

While I agree with some of what Senator Higgins said, publicly quoted companies often have their own individual employee share initiatives where employees can buy shares at a lower rate than those quoted on the market.  That is a good initiative because it promotes employee engagement with the company and longevity in terms of the employee staying with the company.  It also promotes the company in treating the employees in a fairer and more equitable way.  It improves the effectiveness and efficiency of companies and the corporate governance of companies also.<\/p> <p>The tax forgone is one issue to the employee but that will be caught on the other side through capital gains tax.  While one may be forgoing one's employee tax, one will be caught eventually because the minute one tries to take the money out of the share, presumably one will have to pay one's capital gains tax, which is around the 33% mark.  If there is no incentive for the employee, whether a tax saving or otherwise, why would they bother with this scheme?  There must be an incentive.  I believe it is a good scheme.<\/p> <p>In terms of the transparency aspect of Senator Higgins's recommendation, I do not see any issue with that.

When I am in different parts of the world trying to encourage companies to come to Ireland to establish operations, the biggest criticism I hear relates to the early point at which people pay the higher rate of tax rather than the actual rate.  Companies understand the higher rate, but the point at which one hits it in this jurisdiction is the second earliest in the OECD.  That is a real issue.  People do not get the opportunity to take home as much as their counterparts in other jurisdictions.  This scheme is one method by which we can entice people to earn and take home a little bit more.  Similar schemes have been established in other jurisdictions.  Our figure of &euro;10 million is based on the UK statistics, from which we tried to extrapolate based on the relative sizes of our economies.  It is a projection.  Everything we do is measured in line with what the Senator is requesting.  We are not going to see this scheme start, grow legs, be out the door and start to cost hundreds of millions of euro.

It is the individual.<\/p> <p>The relief operates by allowing the employee a more advantageous tax treatment on gains arising on the exercise of qualifying share options.  Gains realised on the exercise of KEEP share options will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise.  The gain will, however, be subject to capital gains tax on the future disposal of the shares.  In the context of the first element of Senator Higgins's proposal, therefore, no tax advantage accrues directly to the company issuing KEEP options.  The company benefits from the improved viability of share options as part of a remuneration package, which will help smaller, cash-poor companies to attract key staff.<\/p> <p>On the second element of the Senator's proposed report, we have had reference to the cost of a similar matured incentive in the UK.  It has been estimated that the full-year cost is &euro;10 million.  However, it is expected to be a number of years before we reach that level.  KEEP is a demand-led scheme and uptake will depend on decisions made by qualifying SME companies to offer share options to employees.  The benefit to the employees exercising KEEP options, and therefore the ultimate tax cost to the Exchequer, will be determined by the growth in value of the employer company shares in the period between grant and exercise of the options.  Further, the tax cost arises only on exercise of the share options and there is a requirement, with very limited exceptions, for KEEP options to be held for a minimum of one year before exercise.  It is likely, therefore, that the Exchequer cost of the KEEP scheme in 2018 will be nil.  It is anticipated that it will take a number of years for the full-year cost of this scheme to be realised.<\/p> <p>Taking these factors into account, I cannot accept the Senator's recommendation.  However, I note that section 10 includes reporting requirements to ensure that information is provided to Revenue on the grant and exercise of KEEP options.  As with all tax expenditures, the annual cost of the KEEP scheme will be published in the tax expenditures report of the Revenue Commissioners and will be kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#CC00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  It is interesting because I had a different reply when I inquired about the &euro;10 million previously.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has clarified that &euro;10 million is the estimated total cost, including tax forgone.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could indicate that this is very different from, for example, the estimate put forward by IBEC of &euro;80 million, which it anticipated as the cost in its 2018 submissions calling for a scheme that was pretty much identical to the one being put forward here.  Can the Minister of State comment on from where that estimate came, particularly as it is quite different from the &euro;10 million?<\/p> <p>If it emerges that the scheme is costing significantly more in tax forgone, will it be reviewed?  If so, at what threshold will that be regarded as a problem?  Will it be where it is costing &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million, for example?  Can the Minister of State give an indication of the point at which we will undertake to monitor the scheme and consider its impact?  This is to ensure that we track it because in the past we have put forward tax incentives - such as capital gains tax waivers - that have had very negative consequences down the line.

It has two aspects.  It is fair to ask about opportunity costs because it is not only about the tax take.  If one loses these individuals, there will be no share options and, as such, no tax will be forgone.  It is also good for companies to divest the shareholding to employees.  This allows employees to own 15% of a company while 85% will be retained by the original holders.<\/p> <p>Looking at this measure straight on, the point the Senator is missing is that if one does not have the scheme in place, one runs the risk of losing intellectual property and capacity through the loss of vital members of staff to companies in the UK, for example, or elsewhere in Europe.  We all know of companies, particularly smaller ones, which find it impossible to compete with the large multinationals and to retain staff.  I have seen it myself.  I was in practice for many years and had start-up clients.  I found typically that it took three years to be in a position to survive and five years to make a profit.  After that, they were suddenly expanding.  They were getting young vibrant people in to take up positions.  In many cases, it was those people's first or second job.  After they had received five or six years' training in these cutting edge companies, those companies could not hold them.  The big boys came looking and they took the staff.<\/p> <p>This measure is not about tax forgone, it is about opportunities lost.  The Senator should look at it from that perspective.  If it is not put in place, we would not even be talking about the share options and we would lose key staff.  Obviously, it will have to be reviewed, but we have to be innovative in a globalised world.  We have to put measures in place which retain intellectual property and allow indigenous Irish companies to grow and become the multinationals of the future.  It is great that multinationals are coming in, but I want to see our own flourishing indigenous companies become the multinationals of the future.  This measure will help to achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#CC01100","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>This scheme has merit and there is a benefit to it.  It is important that companies grow and manage to attract staff.  As Senator Kieran O'Donnell outlined, people can and will be poached and there has to be a reason or incentive for them to stay.  Companies do share option schemes all the time and there is often a very delayed mechanism so that people are incentivised to stay.  We are very heavily reliant on the foreign direct investment sector in this country.  We very much appreciate these companies and the corporation tax receipts that come from them.<\/p> <p>We can all acknowledge, however, that it would be no harm at all if we were to have more Irish-owned and Irish-based multinationals, companies that started and grew in Ireland like the Kerry Group, Smurfit and Roadstone - the more the better.  There needs to be a way in which companies can retain key important individuals.  Be it in schools, business or industry, we all know how important such key figures are.  I am thinking of Michael O'Leary in Ryanair, for example, and many others.<\/p> <p>This whole scheme is about such key employees and how we can try to get them to stay so that those businesses can grow and generate tax receipts to help the disadvantaged and those who are less well-off.  This scheme, then, is worth doing but I think it important that we keep an eye on it and make sure that it is not exposed.  I have no doubt but that that is also the Government's intention here.  It is not the intention of this scheme to allow high net worth individuals to make a fortune without paying any tax on it.  I am sure that the Minister of State will confirm that this is not what it is for, and I ask him to confirm that.  Its purpose, rather, is to retain staff in companies so that they do not get poached by the big boys and so that small companies get a chance to grow.<\/p> <p>We all remember when Ryanair was a small company and Aer Lingus was huge.  Ryanair needed a bit of help at the time and it got it when certain Ministers stopped Aer Lingus from flying certain routes so as to give Ryanair a bit of a chance.  Where are we now?  It is important that we give employees reasons to stay in companies so as to help those companies grow and generate the tax receipts that help everybody.  It is important that we implement this scheme, although I certainly take Senator Higgins's concerns on board.<\/p> <p>At this point, a Chathaoirligh, I would note that we are on section 10 of 87 and still on No. 3 of 15 recommendations.

I am going to flag this now as something I may raise on Report Stage and it is something I have raised here before, but with all of this talk of small companies I feel I need to bring up the point that, when it comes to our smaller companies not growing, a far greater concern is the fact that we incentivise the sale of those companies when they reach a certain point.  Our capital gains tax system gives a preferential rate for selling a company when it reaches a high point.  This is separate issue that I may perhaps discuss with the Minister of State in the future but I think we need to consider whether we might be encouraging people to build companies only to then sell them.  This is a key concern to look at in the future, but I will not talk on it now.<\/p> <p>I also note that our housing costs and services are a major concern in terms of company relocation.

It is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposits required to purchase or build their first homes. With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is only available in respect of new-build or self-build properties.  Following its introduction in budget 2017, Indecon Economic Consultants were commissioned to undertake an independent assessment of the measure, which included examining whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes were being met, as well as the impact it was having on house prices and the residential property market generally.  The Indecon review found that the help-to-buy initiative is meeting its objective of assisting first-time buyers of new homes to fund the deposits required under the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules and that the scheme has not had a measurable effect on house prices to date.  Furthermore, it indicated that:<\/p><blockquote>Indecon&rsquo;s assessment of the HTB is that there was a valid market failure argument for the HTB introduction.  We also believe that the HTB, as a tax refund incentive, was likely to be <i>as<\/i>efficient as a direct expenditure intervention.<\/blockquote> <p>On the basis of the Indecon findings and considering that help-to-buy has only been in operation for less than a year, the Minister decided to allow the measure to continue in its current form for the coming year.<\/p><p>As was mentioned during the Report Stage debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il, in continuing to monitor the scheme, officials may draw upon a range of statistical sources, including data on construction activity and house prices from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as data from the CSO, such as the residential property price index and elements from the quarterly national household survey.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners publish monthly statistical reports on the cost of help-to-buy.  Their report includes the numbers of claims made, approved and paid, as well as breakdowns of the figures by metrics such as property value, loan-to-value ratio and property type.  It also includes a geographical breakdown of claims by county.<\/p><p>As regards the current recommendation, on at Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Minister agreed, on foot of amendments proposed by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Michael McGrath, that a cost-benefit analysis of the incentive will be carried out and concluded ahead of budget 2019 next year.  Given the availability and timeliness of data on the progress of the incentive, the recent Indecon report and now the commitment to undertake a formal cost-benefit analysis on the scheme before the next budget, I believe that the recommendation before us is not warranted.  <\/p><p>In response to Senator Conway-Walsh, I want to put on the record of the House that, according to the most recent figures we have from Revenue, in terms of over 83% of people who have purchased property under the scheme to date, the property has cost &euro;375,000 or under so that puts it into context that the people using this scheme are buying modest houses.  There was a concern that this would be made available for houses over &euro;450,000.  Deputy Boyd Barrett, a known supporter of the policies of the left, made it very clear that &euro;450,000 would not buy someone very much in his constituency.

The fact that people can buy there does not mean they are rich; it just means they have much bigger mortgages than many others and very large obligations on which a lot of their disposable income goes.  This needs to be factored in.  The cheapest unit in a scheme not very far from me cost &euro;795,000 - it was the cheapest on offer - and I think the units were terraced.  We need to look at the scheme.  We are not trying to give away millionaire trophy houses.  At some point, however, there needs to be an examination of certain areas where supply is tiny but demand is huge and some people have access to borrowing.  I think we need to take that on board.

I know the Minister of State also has a recommendation in respect of these schemes so I imagine that we might get to discuss the matter further during the debate on the Minister of State's recommendation.  This is simply to request that the Minister for Finance will, within six months of the passing of the Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the impact of IREFs and REITs on the Irish property and housing sector, including in the context of rental prices and residential and commercial property prices throughout Ireland and on the effective tax rates paid on the profits of these entities and their shareholders.<\/p><p>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State seemed to indicate that he expected to produce a report on this issue.  I am simply raising the matter again because I am concerned that, on Report Stage in the Lower House, it seemed slightly less clear as to whether or not a report will be produced.  When I looked at the debate, it indicated that the Minister of State was checking to see what he would be able to examine and provide.  This recommendation has been tabled to give the Minister of State an opportunity to clarify what report he will provide.  I know he is expecting figures from Revenue in March 2018 in respect of the IREF schemes but there is a real concern here.<\/p><p>In many cases, capital gains tax waivers effectively acted as an invitation to large vulture funds in Ireland.  There were inadvertent and significant consequences.  Again, the dangerous potential impact of capital gains tax measures that bring in companies was flagged at the time and consistently since then.  I am very concerned.  In respect of continuing that capital gains tax waiver and foreshortening the time required in terms of returning it, I know the goal has been expressed in terms of freeing up property transactions.  However, I am very concerned because I do not believe there are robust measures in place.  We worked with the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and improved them in the Seanad.  Unfortunately, they were slightly diluted in the D&aacute;il.  Protections against pressure for vacant possession in the case of those sales are not adequate.  If properties are going to be changing hands, and we are looking at quite a lot of properties potentially flipping and changing hands, in the context of REITs and IREFs, we need to look and drill down to see how these actors are affecting the market not simply in terms of how and by how much they are profiting but what impact they are having on issues like stability of tenure, rental prices and residential and commercial property prices, particularly given the waivers that are there in areas like major refurbishment.<\/p><p>This recommendation is really a request to the effect that the Minister of State be clear in the context of what information he can provide in respect of these schemes and how we can analyse them.  Perhaps the Minister of State might make clear whether there has been a very strong risk assessment has been carried out not only in terms of the capital gains tax waivers, which we saw previously, but also regarding the changes in those waivers and the likely impact thereof.  The fact is that 42% of sales in Dublin are going to this type of investor as opposed to only 25% of first-time buyers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are key and very strong actors.  This is a distortion in the market, and we are seeing the same mistakes made again and again.  The Minister of State talked about companies and their relocation.  The fact of having a property market, having every house and apartment in Dublin potentially acting as a speculative investment again rather than a home or a potential home, is a greater danger to the growth of industry and the attraction of genuine investment in the form of companies with workers who wish to locate in our towns and cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#EE01400","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I point out to Members that the Order of Business reads, \"Finance Bill 2017 - Committee Stage, to be taken at 1.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 4.15 p.m., if not previous concluded, by the putting of one question from the Chair which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Government\".

The section was introduced to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors.  IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITSs, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this will also fall into the regime regardless of the level of property.  Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.  Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax acts.  The new regime applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.  I am advised by Revenue that the first returns from IREFs will be filed in the middle of next year.  If any areas of concern are identified, they will be addressed.  I am also advised that my Department has been working with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to get a more granular breakdown of the non-household buyer category classification into further categories.  However, it will be March 2018 at the earliest before this information is available.<\/p> <p>Real estate investment trusts, REITs, were introduced by the Finance Act 2013.  The regime provides for a collective investment vehicle for persons wishing to invest in property.  REITs must be widely held as it is a requirement that the REIT not be a \"close company\", that is, a REIT cannot be under the control of five or fewer persons.  A REIT must hold at least three properties and carry on a business of letting property.  No one property may account for more than 40% of the total value of the property in the REIT.  The REIT must derive at least 75% of its profits from property rental and must distribute at least 85% of its property income to shareholders.<\/p> <p>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that as there are only three REITs in Ireland at present, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality it will not be possible for Revenue to share the information sought with the Senator or indeed me.  However, I understand that Revenue's large cases division has a dedicated team who look after REITs.  As the REIT regime was introduced in the Finance Act 2013, that team is, as part of Revenue's normal compliance review process, reviewing the structures of those REITs and the tax payable by those companies.  Should any issues arise from the review, Revenue will bring those matters to the attention of my officials.<\/p> <p>I wish to advise the Senator that on Committee and Report Stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann I agreed that certain issues raised in amendments tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty in respect of IREFs and REITs would be examined by the tax strategy group.  However, given the constraints in respect of availability of information and taxpayer confidentiality, it would not be appropriate to put the preparation of the requested reports into legislation.  I cannot commend these recommendations to the Seanad but I can assure the Senator that both the IREFs and REITs are being kept under constant review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017120600002#FF00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1512556200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>To clarify, while the Minister of State says he cannot accept the recommendation and its provision in respect of a report, will the issues arising from Revenue's investigations and his conversations be brought into the public domain where we can debate them?

This means that hundreds of billions of euro transferred here in recent years, especially in 2015, can still be used by companies to potentially neutralise their corporation tax bills.  We believe this is totally unacceptable.  In this regard, I welcome Seamus Coffey's recent comments recommending that the Government's new cap on the write-down of intangible assets apply to all assets, as opposed to the Government's proposal, which grandfathers the new measure, meaning the 80% cap will only apply to intangible assets acquired post-budget.<\/p> <p>Due to the proposed cap not applying to all intangible assets, the State could be missing out on a huge amount of corporate tax revenue which may not materialise.  Seamus Coffey notes that if the cap applied to all claims, existing and new, the additional corporation tax to be collected in 2018 could be up to &euro;1 billion, using the 2015 figure published by Revenue and estimates from that time used by the Department of Finance, as opposed to the &euro;150 million the Government expects to raise through the grandfathered measure.<\/p> <p>We are paying for these onshored assets because they count towards the GNI, pushing up our EU contribution, so we are letting these companies pay no tax through their intangible asset write-downs and the State is picking up the tab regarding increased contributions to the EU budget due to the tax-free earnings many of these companies have from the intangible assets.  The State is making payments of approximately &euro;200 million per annum to the EU budget as a result of the gross income which makes no contribution to Ireland's national budget.  Over the ten-year period, this would result in payments of around &euro;2 billion.  We are diverting money from potential spending programmes to pay for the associated EU budget contributions this untaxed income requires each year, with the increases in EU budget contributions counting towards our fiscal space.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government needs to amend its proposal to include all intangible assets in order to safeguard our tax base and to ensure that this State is not unnecessarily picking up the tab for increased EU budget contributions related to tax-free multinational activities.

The measure was recommended by Mr. S&eacute;amus Coffey in his review of Ireland's corporation tax code in order to ensure that there was a smoothing of corporation tax receipts over time.<\/p> <p>Section 25 amends section 291 of the Tax Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for the 80% cap.  This amendment applies in respect of capital expenditure incurred on intangible assets on or after 11 October 2017.  The 80% cap will affect the timing of relief in the form of capital allowances and related interest and expenses for intangible assets but will not affect the overall quantum of relief.  This is because any amount restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap will be available to be carried forward and used in subsequent accounting periods subsequent to the application of the cap in that period.  Section 25 also makes a minor technical amendment to section 291(a) to clarify the scheme of relief applies where companies whole trading activities consist of relevant activities.  Section 291(a) currently makes reference to relevant activities carried on as part of a trade.
