The Bill proceeded through its second stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October 2012. <\/p><p>  At the outset, let me say that the Bill will not change the basis of valuation for rating purposes. This will continue to be &quot;net annual value&quot; which is the hypothetical rental value of a property as assessed by reference to a specified date. This is a long standing principle of the rateable valuation system in Ireland and ensures equity and fairness in relation to the values of commercial and industrial properties across a local authority area.<\/p><p>  The primary purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the national programme of revaluing every commercial and industrial property in the country which is being undertaken by the Valuation Office. The Bill amends several provisions contained in the Valuation Act 2001. These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act which deals with how valuations, including revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out. The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6, which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas between revaluations. In both instances, it is envisaged that the Commissioner of Valuation will appoint officers to carry out the tasks in question and the Bill makes specific provision for the appointment of &quot;revision managers&quot;. Section 6 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 19 of the Valuation Act 2001 by enabling the Commissioner to appoint persons to carry out the revaluation of entire rating authority areas. Such persons may be an officer of the Commissioner. However, provision is also made for the Commissioner to enter into an arrangement with a person or persons (other than officers of the Commissioner) to assist in the performance of the revaluation function. The effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources.<\/p><p>  Following enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that revaluation projects can be conducted through the normal direct assessment methodology. \u00a0However, the Bill (Section 11, inserting a new Part 5A into the 2001 Act) also provides for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation using elements of self-assessment by ratepayers. This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise self-assessment principles. I also wish to draw the attention of the\u00a0Deputies\u00a0to Section 22 of the Bill which proposes to amend Section 48 of the 2001 Act by providing for the use of general market data or aggregated data (including statistical and computer-aided techniques) in determining valuations, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>  Since the 2nd  stage debate was taken in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, officials in my Department and the Valuation Office have engaged in an extensive consultation process on various aspects of the Bill with a range of stakeholders. While the legislation is quite complex, the amendments to be proposed at Committee Stage in the Seanad are at an advanced stage of drafting. Every effort is being made to expedite the passage of the Bill and I expect to see it progressing through the Oireachtas before the Summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200069#WRC00231","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Assessments","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200069#WRC00250"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[2577\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200069#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps being taken to address flood risks within the Shannon basin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management Study.

Work is under way in my Department on updating this figure; this exercise will estimate the position as of December 2012, and will take into account the relevant changes in public service pay and pensions over recent years. It is expected that the updated estimate of the accrued liability will be available early this year.  The updated liability figure arising from this exercise will be an important consideration in the ongoing development of public service pension policy.  Notwithstanding that the revised total liability figure is awaited, I am satisfied that adequate planning and provision is being made for the future payment of public service pensions, though this is naturally a matter which is kept under close review.  My view is based on a series of cost containment measures put in place over recent years affecting existing pensioners, serving staff and new recruits.<\/p><p>  The most significant cost-saving reform has been the introduction in January 2013 of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme , also known as the Single Scheme, which is the default pension scheme  for new-hire workers across the entire public service.  This landmark reform targets very substantial long-run savings of about one third of pension outgoing, with those savings deriving mainly from career-average (not final-salary) pension accrual, inflation (not pay) linkage of benefits, and higher minimum pension age (effectively 68 years for most new joiners).<\/p><p>  Several other measures have also been taken over recent years which help to curb public service pension costs as follows:<blockquote>- In 2004 minimum pension age for new-joiner public service workers was raised from 60 to 65 years.<br \/><br \/>- In 2010 public service pay cuts averaging approximately 7% were applied.

This brings Ireland's total contribution to UNRWA's appeals for Gaza to &euro;4.64 million since 2006 and underlies our continuing commitment to meeting the emergency needs of the Palestinian people.  UNRWA's food assistance provides a lifeline for thousands of refugee families in Gaza and helps to prevent a potentially large scale crisis in a context where an estimated 57% of households are classified as food insecure.  This funding support was in addition to Ireland's broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people and brought our total funding support in 2013 to &euro;10.7 million.

Sovereign immunity, also known as State immunity, is an established principle of customary international law and is recognised in Irish law, although there is no domestic legislation on the topic.  This was acknowledged by the Supreme Court in the case of Canada v Employment Appeals Tribunal (1992).  The State is required as a matter of law to respect sovereign immunity. <\/p><p>  Sovereign immunity means that, subject to certain exceptions, states are not subject to the jurisdiction of other states.  Sovereign immunity may also apply to officials &ndash; for example officials of one state visiting the territory of another state may be immune from arrest and trial.  The fact that immunity applies, however, does not exempt states or their officials from their obligation to respect the law and nor does it prevent the investigation of any alleged criminal offence.  Sovereign immunity is procedural only and may be waived by the state enjoying it.<\/p><p>  As I have said on previous occasions, where allegations of extraordinary rendition through Shannon Airport have been made, including by members of the Oireachtas, these have been fully investigated by senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.

However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. <\/p><p>  The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. I understand that the Working Group will report its findings before the end of Spring 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200076#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Outsourcing of Public Services","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200076#WRK01050"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[3299\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200076#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total amount of outsourcing that has been achieved in his Department since the letter sent by Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in March 2012; the names of the outsourcing companies that have been involved; the total savings achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>The work of my Department and of the wider Education and Training sector already includes the use of a diverse range of outsourcing arrangements relating to such areas as the school building programme, education and training courses at various levels, services provided for teachers and special needs assistants and a range of corporate functions for education providers such as ICT support, payroll, HR, waste management, cleaning and security.

Administrative burdens will be reduced, procurement procedures simplified, and costs related to tendering lowered by making procurement systems more transparent.  The use of e-procurement will also simplify the processes and foster greater competition. It will strengthen the generation of jobs and growth, given that public authorities across the European Union spend approximately &euro;2 trillion per annum (some 19% of EU GDP) on the procurement of goods, services and works.<\/p><p>  Some of the measures included in the reform of the general procurement rules that will facilitate SME involvement include:<\/p><p>- Acceptance of self-declarations until the award stage and the promotion of e-procurement with mandatory electronic availability of procurement documents;<\/p><p>- Except in justified cases, turnover requirements are to be explicitly limited to two times the estimated contract value;<\/p><p>- Contracting Authorities will now have to comply or explain in relation to the division of contracts into lots;<\/p><p>- Member states will be required to provide the Commission with detail on SME participation.  Such monitoring can support consistent application across all Member States and ensure that the objective of greater SME involvement is being delivered.<\/p><p>  In addition, the new Directive on concessions will be ensure Union wide competition for high value concessions where the most efficient providers are given a fair chance of winning the contract. This will enable Irish business to have greater access to high value contracts within the EU.<\/p><p>  Given current budgetary constraints it is vital that the public procurement market works effectively to deliver value for money. Inflexible procedures, which limit the ability to negotiate, have restricted the opportunities to promote innovation in public procurement. There will be a new innovation partnership procedure in both the Classical and Utilities Directives. The shortening of times limits and greater flexibility in the choice of procedure can facilitate delivery of value for money by contracting authorities alongside the provision of innovative solutions.<\/p><p>  In summary, the package will promote simplified procurement, better access for SMEs, sound procedures and governance, and improved value for money. While the transposition of these new rules is a priority for Government, it is important to ensure that the transposition is carried out in a manner that maximises the aforementioned benefits. Member States have two years to transpose the three Directives. However, I am keen to ensure that Ireland can avail of the flexibility afforded by these Directives and with this in mind my officials are prioritising this area of work with the view to completion by early next year.<\/p><p>* Concessions are partnerships between the public sector and mostly private companies, where the latter exclusively operate, maintain and carry out the development of infrastructure (i.e. ports, water distribution, parking garages, toll roads) or provide services of general economic interest (energy, water and waste disposal).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200077#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200077#WRL00325"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[3076\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200077#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a new office for Government procurement will be set up in County Cork; and to set out how staff will be appointed to such an office.

In this context, I am satisfied that the Croke Park Agreement has delivered on, and indeed exceeded, its objectives.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Agreement is already delivering on its objectives. In terms of cost reduction, approximately &euro;300 million in savings, arising from the implementation of various measures under the Agreement, was incorporated into the various votes in the context of the Revised Estimates for 2013. The measures and reforms implemented under the Agreement helped to ensure that spending remained in line with profile and resulted in Ireland delivering on our fiscal target for 2013. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, savings under the Agreement were included in the budgetary arithmetic for 2014, in the expenditure ceilings for each Vote, as appropriate. Similarly, the savings to be generated from the Agreement in 2015 will be incorporated into the expenditure ceilings for each Vote as part of the estimates process.<\/p><p>  In addition to these monetary targets, a number of changes in work practices and reforms have been implemented since 1 July 2013.

These additional hours will help us to deliver long term and sustainable increases in productivity, while also helping to improve the provision of services to citizens. The benefits from the additional hours under the Agreement are significant, with measures around increased productivity set to deliver approximately &euro;430 million of the &euro;1 billion targeted savings.<\/p><p>  On 14 January, I published a new Public Service Reform Plan, covering the period 2014 to 2016.\u00a0 A progress report on the previous Reform Plan was also published.

A zero hour contract must be entered into freely between the employer and the employee &ndash; it cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero hour contracts are normally found in sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality.  I am very conscious that in<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  both employers and employees.  They allow greater flexibility for both, reducing the employer&rsquo;s pay costs, while workers can decide when and if they want to work.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers.  However this is an area I will keep under review.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 contains a protection for employees who are employed on zero hour contracts.  The zero hour protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  This feature of the Organisation of Working Time Act covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he\/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he\/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he\/she is required to be available or 15 hours whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  Claims of breaches of section 18 may be referred to a rights commissioner.<\/p><p>  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.  The zero hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him\/herself available for work.<\/p><p>  Sections 17 and 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act may also be of particular interest to employees on zero hour contracts.  Section 17 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he\/she will be required to work during the week. Generally, an employee is entitled to 24 hours&rsquo; notice of his\/her roster for the week, although section 17(4) allows for changes as a result of unforeseen circumstances.<\/p><p>  Section 19 sets out an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to paid annual leave equal to 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment) or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200079#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[3152\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200079#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of prosecutions for failure to comply with minimum wage legislation in each year from 2008 to 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislations.

The total spend to date is some &euro;2.2 million.  This spending refers to this Department only and does not include spending from other Government Departments or Agencies which has been significant.  Following the June 2012 flooding, 123 payments were made to affected householders in the Cork area to the value of approximately &euro;150,000.<\/p><p>  The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is means tested, provides emergency financial assistance to households who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs in the period immediately following flooding. The aim of the scheme is to provide financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes and in doing so provide hardship alleviation, as opposed to full compensation.  Repairs for structural damage caused as a result of the flooding can also be considered under the scheme.  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted. Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. <\/p><p>  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the flooding event of June 2012, or as a result of the recent severe weather conditions, should contact the Department&rsquo;s local  representative administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200080#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"F&Aacute;S Staff Issues","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200080#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[2975\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200080#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the way she plans to deal with ex-F&Aacute;S clerical officers who were one interview away from the position of employment services officer, that is, higher executive officer at the time upon transfer to her Department.","asker":"1056","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>The terms and conditions under which staff from the Employment and Community Services Divisions of F&Aacute;S transferred to my department were subject to lengthy negotiations with the unions and also involved the assistance of the Labour Court.

The deciding officer found that there were no grounds to overturn the original decision to disallow invalidity pension. <\/p><p>  However due to an unfortunate oversight the person concerned was not notified of the outcome until 09 October 2013 and advised of her right to appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).

Prior to sending the papers to the SWAO, the Department is having the entirety of the medical evidence examined by a medical assessor.  It is expected that the medical assessor will have completed the assessment and provided an up-to-date opinion today.  In view of the particular circumstances of this case, a deciding officer will review the claim immediately upon receipt of that opinion.  If, following this review, it is decided that she still does not satisfy the medical criteria, the person in question will be notified and her file and all relevant papers will be immediately prepared and forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for determination.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have been implemented with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review is to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  It is also essential that State support for rents do not distort the market in way that could increase rent prices for others including low paid workers and students.  <\/p><p>  In Westmeath, the monthly shared rate for a single person is &euro;190 and the couple shared rate is &euro;210. <\/p><p>  Analysis shows that there are properties available in county Westmeath within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients.  Latest figures show that there are approximately 1,600 rent supplement recipients in Westmeath, with approximately 100 of these in shared accommodation indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation within the rent limits. <\/p><p>  Officials in the Department will continue to monitor the impact of the revised rates ensuring that the accommodation needs of rent supplement recipients are met. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200082#WRQ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200082#WRQ00575"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[3087\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200082#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide assistance to unemployed\u00a0persons who are unable to qualify for primary payments because of spouses income\u00a0and are unable to\u00a0afford and are\u00a0not eligible\u00a0to participate in retraining and Department schemes such as\u00a0JobBridge, Springboard and community employment schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In general, the contracts are used to supplement and complement, rather than replace departmental activities. For example, about half of the Department&rsquo;s public offices are operated by private sector providers. The Department also contracts with third party payment agencies, with third party providers of IT services and with third party providers of employment and illness\/disability services. The Department spends some &euro;120M annually with external providers, which represents about 20% of overall administrative costs.<\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s records show that, since March 2012, external service delivery contracts have been signed to a total amount of c. &euro;150M (excluding VAT). Some of these contracts extend over a number of years. These include new and renewed contracts for the provision of Local Employment Services (LES) and Job Clubs as well as contracts for the provision of services such as file management, staff training and IT support. The names of these contractors are set out in appendix 1 hereunder. <\/p><p>  As the contracts are, in general, not used to replace or substitute any existing Departmental activities, the issue of savings does not tend to arise.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.<\/p><p>  Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing which is financed from my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP), Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing and halting site bays and funded by means of 100% capital grant, private housing assisted by local authority or voluntary housing bodies, private rented accommodation and through their own resources. It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation, and local authority programmes are intended to reflect these preferences.<\/p><p>  Local authorities are statutorily required to prepare and adopt multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes for their areas. The most recent round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes for the period 2009 - 2013 was substantially completed in December, with some on-going works being carried into 2014. Local authorities are currently making arrangements for the next round of programmes which must be adopted by 30 April and which will run from 2014 to 2018 . Since the adoption of the third round of programmes in 2009, it is estimated that over 450 units of Traveller-specific accommodation had been provided by end 2012, supported by the provision of approximately &euro;50 million in capital funding from my Department. My Department also provides funding for accommodation related supports which operate in tandem with the capital programme. This year some &euro;6.250 million is being provided in respect of Traveller accommodation. <\/p><p>  Local authorities are required to produce annual progress reports which measure the provision of Traveller accommodation in a given year against the target figure contained in their Traveller Accommodation Programme. As part of this process, housing authorities are requested to provide an explanation for any variations between targets and outputs. Local authorities cite various reasons for failing to meet targets and these include Traveller families refusing offers of accommodation, families only willing to live in certain areas where housing availability may be an issue, difficulties in obtaining Traveller agreement locally, planning and legal problems, difficulties in obtaining site access and anti-social behaviour by Traveller families which can delay development of projects. This information is circulated to, and discussed by, the statutory National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee at its meetings during the year; the Committee advises me on a range of issues in relation to Traveller accommodation.<\/p><p>  The 2012 Annual Count identified a total of 9,929<b><\/b>Traveller families in the State. In spite of the huge increase of 5,139 families between 1999 and 2012, only 3.32%<b><\/b>of the 9,929 families were living on unauthorised sites in 2012. This reduction in the number of families living on unauthorised sites, despite a large increase in the overall number of families, is concrete evidence of the results of investment in Traveller accommodation over the last decade.<\/p><p>  The National Traveller Management Advisory Committee (NTMAC) which falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality issued a report on Traveller mental health in 2013. This report was brought to the attention of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee and it will be a matter for this Committee to make recommendations with regard to any policy changes needed in the light of the NTMAC report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS00750"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[3291\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a list of all processes currently being undertaken within Government to determine climate change mitigation policy and the public participation opportunities incorporated in those processes.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[3325\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a list of all processes currently being undertaken within Government to determine climate change adaptation policy and the public participation opportunities incorporated in those process.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[3330\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the research that has been commissioned by his Department in relation to climate change mitigation and-or adaptation over the past year; and if he will supply a copy of the terms of reference for any such research.

In addition to the comprehensive open consultation undertaken by my Department in 2012, the Oireachtas Joint Committee facilitated a round of stakeholder engagement on the final policy analysis report from the Secretariat to the National Social and Economic Council and the outline Heads of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill which I released in February 2013. I am now considering the Joint Committee's report, as well as a range of other issues, with a view to finalising the draft Heads of the Bill as soon as possible. Subject to the approval of Government, my intention is to publish the final Heads before Easter 2014.   <\/p><p>  In anticipation of the planned primary legislation, a National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 is now being developed. At present, Departments with responsibility for the key sectors in the national transition agenda are currently preparing the sectoral elements for incorporation into the national roadmap. The key sectors are electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture.<\/p><p>  To ensure that the roadmapping process is inclusive, informed and transparent, the public has already been invited, by the Departments concerned, to input to the sectoral work on electricity generation, agriculture and transport. A public consultation paper on the built environment, which is being developed jointly by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is at an advanced stage and will be issued for consultation shortly. Feedback through these sectoral consultations will input into the key sectoral contributions to the first draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap which I intend to release, together with a draft Strategic Environment Assessment, for a substantial period of open consultation later this year. My intention is to ensure that the first draft national roadmap will be informed and technically sound, and provide a solid basis for a constructive, transparent and inclusive open debate.<\/p><p>  In addition to a direct involvement in the sectoral element of the roadmapping process related to the built environment, my Department&rsquo;s responsibility for overall coordination of national climate policy, both mitigation and adaptation, constitutes a major contribution to the development of national greenhouse gas emission reduction policies and actions. Having facilitated the comprehensive open consultation at the outset of the national policy development Programme, my Department will also lead and coordinate the open consultation on the draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap and Strategic Environment Assessment which will conclude the Programme later this year.<\/p><p>  In parallel to the mitigation agenda, the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework which I issued in December 2012 provides for the development and implementation of sectoral and local adaptation action plans which will form part of a comprehensive national response to the impacts of climate change. Under the framework, sectoral plans will be developed by the relevant Government Department or Agency and adopted by the relevant Minister. Draft sectoral plans are due to be published by mid-2014, and details of the lead Departments and Agencies are set out in section 4 of the framework. On stakeholder consultation, the framework states that &ldquo;Government Departments and bodies will adopt an open, transparent, and inclusive approach to sectoral adaptation planning, with interested organisations and stakeholders being given early and adequate opportunity to input to the process of preparing adaptation plans&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  Local adaptation action planning will be undertaken by local authorities. The national framework states that &quot;the spatial planning process, with full engagement of key stakeholders, provides an established means through which to implement and integrate climate change objectives, including adaptation, at local level&quot;. On stakeholder consultation, the framework adds that &quot;local authorities will continue to consult and encourage partnership with stakeholders when addressing adaptation matters at a local level, particularly through the open and participative process for making development plans, into which local adaptation planning is to be integrated&quot;.<\/p><p>  My Department has not commissioned any research on greenhouse gas mitigation or climate change adaptation over the past year. However, my Department sought technical support from the Economic and Social Research Institute and University College Cork on low-carbon roadmapping, and on modelling in the context of the 2030 EU framework for climate and energy policies. This work relates generally to scenario modelling for the purpose of informing and bringing technical robustness to preparation of the first National Low-Carbon Roadmap for 2050, and Irish engagement in EU climate policy development for 2030. My Department's work, with the benefit of the technical support which it is receiving from ESRI\/UCC, is key to finalising an informed and technically sound draft national roadmap for consultation later this year. In the interest of a transparent and inclusive debate on the draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap, I will consider releasing the technical background work on roadmapping for the purposes of the consultation.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Funding","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[2977\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200084#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when Dublin City Council will receive its 2014 budget allocation for housing adaptations for persons with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have also received a number of representations on the matter from the Law Society, concerned members of its staff and from trade union representatives.   <\/p><p>  It is fundamental that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, to be established under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, be independent of the legal professions and of the Government in the performance of its functions. This will include its implementation of new and independent procedures relating to allegations of professional misconduct by either solicitors or barristers. Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the new Regulatory Authority's Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Under the Bill, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or to the Bar Council with their complaints in the first instance, as happens at the moment, but will instead make them through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>  The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal procedures is, therefore, fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any perception among members of the public that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers themselves or by their representative bodies. In that spirit, I have previously welcomed the recognition, by the Law Society, that it would be &quot;in the best interests of the public and the profession&quot; if complaints about solicitors were no longer to be dealt with by the Society but by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. This stance has helped to underpin public perceptions of impartiality in the proposed new professional conduct regime to the utmost degree. <\/p><p>  It is also desirable that the independence of the new regulatory regime be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes for staff of the new Authority and it is considered that such appointments should be better made by the Authority itself under open and public competition. Under this scenario, it should be open to existing staff of the legal professional bodies - who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience - to apply for those positions advertised by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which would then fill them independently.   <\/p><p>  At the same time, I readily acknowledge that the proposed reforms to the legal professional conduct regime will have negative implications for a number of existing and appropriately skilled staff who currently deal with public complaints made through the legal professional bodies.

","asker":"1065","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>In relation to the first matter raised by the Deputy, I am advised that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department operates a number of helplines to facilitate clients in making enquiries on immigration and citizenship issues. These helplines are provided between certain set periods each week, for example, the citizenship helpline is available two mornings a week from 10am to 12.30pm. The periods for which the helplines operate strikes a balance between facilitating customers in making queries to INIS and the overall priority of ensuring that immigration and citizenship applications are processed as quickly as possible. In addition to the provision of helpline services, email facilities are also provided, allowing customers to contact INIS at their own convenience. Details of all helpline and email services are set out on the INIS website, www.inis.gov.ie. It must also be emphasised that INIS, together with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, provides public services at its offices at Burgh Quay in respect of registration of non-EEA persons residing in the State and for applicants seeking re-entry visas. Furthermore, on a daily basis the office receives a number of callers seeking information or for other business. In total the number of persons attending the office is in the region of 130,000 per annum.<\/p><p>  Regarding the second part of the Question concerning Immigration Officers, provision is made at section 3(1) of the Immigration Act 2004 for the Minister for Justice and Equality to appoint such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate (referred to in the Act of 2004 as &ldquo;Immigration Officers&rdquo;) to perform the functions conferred on Immigration Officers by the Act . The majority of persons appointed as Immigration Officers are Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the remainder comprising officials of my Department working in the immigration area who have been appointed as Immigration Officers for the purposes of carrying out their duties. Figures for the number of persons appointed Immigration Officers in the period 1990 to 1998 are not available. However, I can inform the Deputy that since 2004 the total number of Garda&iacute; and officials of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service appointed as Immigration Officers under the Immigration Act 2004 is 623. It should be noted that all persons who were acting as an Immigration Officer prior to the commencement of the 2004 Immigration Act were upon commencement of the Act deemed to have been appointed as an Immigration Officer under section 3 of the Act.<\/p><p>  Finally, it is not clear in respect of the citizenship element of the Question as to whether the Deputy has a particular case in mind and in the absence of specific details it is difficult to evaluate eligibility for citizenship.  However, the general position is that the mere fact of having a child born in Ireland confers no additional rights to citizenship for its parents. The eligibility of parents to be considered for naturalisation will depend on the nature, duration and legality of their own residence in accordance with the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, (as amended). The child's own eligibility for citizenship at birth will, under the same Act, depend on the status of his\/her parents, for instance whether one of them is an Irish national, or, in the case of a foreign national parent, whether they have, prior to the child's birth, met the residency requirements of the Act.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200087#WRV00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200087#WRV00950"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[3115\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200087#WRV01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of outstanding warrants in each Garda District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region as of 16 January 2014.

I have been actively assessing the damage to the many small Local Authority piers and harbours right around the coast. I am aware of the critical importance of this local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.<\/p><p>  The Government in considering the totality of the impact of the storms decided that the Local Authorities need to do a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks. That comprehensive assessment will then enable Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of these exceptionally bad storms.<\/p><p>  On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there are a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen, which are administered by BIM. <\/p><p>  There have been some reports in the media about the loss, by some inshore fishermen, of their pots. It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter. It is too early to fully determine the scale of the losses and if these were widespread.  I will in the coming days be endeavouring to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.<\/p><p>  In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges I will have to take account of the fact that EU Law limits the options. The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU State Aid rules.  It is clear that under State Aid rules no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  <\/p><p>  In relation to pots, the European Fisheries Fund Regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in relation to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching State Aid rules.  <\/p><p>  However, while all of these constraints and considerations exist, I am still endeavouring to get a full picture of the situation and when that is to hand I will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical and appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200089#WRX00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Parcel Identification System","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200089#WRX00550"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[3057\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012200089#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding scrub land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme as well as REPS and AEOS.
