Due to the need to reduce public expenditure, a number of reductions were made to the  Early Childcare Supplement from 2009 and the then Government took a decision to abolish the Early Childcare Supplement with effect from the 31st December 2009.  At its peak the payment cost &euro;480 million in 2008.  Some of the funding previously available to support the provision of the  Early Childcare Supplement was re-directed to provide for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, or free pre-school year, at an annual cost of &euro;175 million.<\/p><p>  The redirection of resources to this more targeted and child-centred policy is in line with the generally held principle that pre-primary education is a key determinant of student performance at all levels of education as it leads to improvements in motivation and the propensity to learn, which in turn raises the social and private returns from all future investments in their education.  It also addressed the general criticism of the  Early Childcare Supplement that it directed resources away from a more targeted and beneficial investment in early years care and education, in particular in the form of pre-school education.<\/p><p>  While I believe the last Government missed a great opportunity to re-direct more money from the Early Childcare Supplement into promoting greater quality and accessibility for early childhood care and education, this Government has no plans to re-introduce the Early Childcare Supplement.  Even if such funding was available from the Exchequer, its re-introduction would not be a good use of resources which would yield much greater benefits if used to directly support quality early years services.<\/p><p>  This Government has made a very significant commitment in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the current budgetary situation.   The Early Childhood Care and Education programme, which represents an investment of almost &euro;175 million annually, is funded by my Department through the provision of capitation grants paid directly to participating services.  It is a fundamental principle of the programme that the pre-school provision is available to parents free of charge.  In the region of 68,000 children benefit from the free pre-school provision each year.<\/p><p>  There is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years.

These trends reflect the significant decline in recent years in the number of children, particularly infants, available for adoption, as child welfare and protection systems have improved in developing countries which previously placed large numbers of children for adoption.   In many cases these reforms in countries of origin have been given expression and impetus by their ratification of the Hague Convention.  The Convention requires members to strengthen protections for children, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process and to prioritise the improvement of systems for the care and adoption of children domestically.  This requirement is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 21. With the passing of the Adoption Act 2010 Ireland ratified the Hague Convention on the 1st November 2010 and is now one of 93 contracting States to the Convention.  <\/p><p>  The Adoption Authority continues to promote cooperation in intercountry adoption with relevant countries.  The Adoption Authority has successfully concluded administrative arrangements with both Vietnam and the US and adoptions from these countries are continuing. In recent weeks adoptions have recommenced from Vietnam for the first time since 2009. The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of other Hague Convention countries in relation to intercountry adoptions including Bulgaria, China, Thailand, the Philippines and India.  The Authority has recently visited Haiti as part of an initial examination of intercountry adoption with Haiti.<\/p><p>  It is important to recognise that, although a country may be a member of Hague, legal and administrative obstacles may remain, there may be no children available for adoption, restrictions may be imposed in relation to the categories of children or prospective adoptive parents qualifying or the host country may not wish to prioritise cooperation with Ireland from amongst the countries wishing to establish relations.   <\/p><p>  With regard to dealings with non-Hague countries, work is ongoing in relation to discussions on a bilateral adoption agreement with the Russian Federation. The Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation have advised the Irish Embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements are currently on hold while the Russian Government considers proposals in relation to how they deal with adoption agreements in general. It is understood that the Russian Federation's Supreme Court recently made recommendations regarding adoption agreements and these are currently being considered by the Russian Government. It is hoped that following the Russian Government's consideration of these matters they will be in a position to examine and respond to the Irish proposals.  <\/p><p>  I am also aware that Ethiopia is currently seeking to bring its adoption standards up to those required under the Hague Convention and I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me updated on the position.

The programme is expected to cost about &euro;175m in the current year, including the cost of administration.  <\/p><p>  Just over 65,000 children participated in the programme in the 2011\/2012 school year.  Approximately 68,000 children availed of the provision in the 2012\/2013 academic year, and similar numbers are expected to avail of the provision during this academic year.   A total of 4,220 childcare providers are participating in the programme in this academic year and a table listing those service providers is being forwarded directly to the Deputy.  <\/p><p>  Despite the challenging budgetary situation, the pre-school year has been maintained as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality pre-school services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.<\/p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence quantifying the benefits of early years interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.    A second free pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000-5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time. <\/p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not presently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Early Years Quality Agenda, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<\/p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered as part of the preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy.  The report of the Expert Advisory Group which I appointed to advise on recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy, &lsquo;Right from the Start&rsquo;, sets out a wide range of recommendations for consideration and will contribute substantially to the final draft of the Early Years Strategy.  One of the recommendations in the Report for consideration in the preparation of the Strategy is to extend the free pre-school provision, but only after achieving higher quality standards, more investment in training and mentoring, and professionalisation of the Early Years workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100053#WRA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100054#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[28012\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100054#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when he expects to formally establish a commission of investigation into mother and baby homes; the budget he will be providing for the Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>As I have outlined to the House today, the Commission of Investigation into concerns relating to the Mother and Baby Homes will be statutory and independent and will operate under the Commission of Investigations Act, 2004.

The introduction of this legislation is in line with a key Programme for Government commitment, and it represents an important and necessary addition to the child welfare and protection system.<\/p><p>  Certain persons, who are mandated persons under the Bill, will be required by the legislation to report child welfare and protection concerns to the Child and Family Agency. Mandated persons will also be required to report to the Agency any disclosures of harm made to the mandated person by a child.  The reporting of harm to children by persons, who by virtue of their training, qualifications and professional experience are well equipped to recognise harm, is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessment of risk by the Agency. The Bill also provides that organisations providing services to children will have to consider the potential for risk to children availing of their services and demonstrate awareness and good practice in a Child Safeguarding Statement which will be available to parents and the public generally. <\/p><p>  The Bill will operate side-by-side with the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns. It is intended that the Guidance will be revised and updated to take account of new legislative obligations so as to provide in one place a complete reference resource for individuals and organisations.  This will provide clarity and ensure consistency between the proposed legislation and the existing non-statutory obligations which will continue to operate administratively for all sectors of society. <\/p><p>  As regards implementation, my Department is taking a lead role in the cross-sectoral implementation of Children First.

At that point, a new registration system which will require childcare services to register with the Early Years Inspectorate in advance of opening, rather than simply notifying the Inspectorate of their existence, will be placed on a statutory basis.  This will require the Inspectorate to commence the assessment of the quality of a service before it opens.  Inspectors will also be able to impose conditions on services which, if not complied with, can result in de-registration.  In the meantime, services are being registered on an administrative basis, and all new services receive a pre-registration visit from the Early Years Inspectorate. <\/p><p>  The drafting of the regulations required a review of the draft National Standards and of the 2006 Regulations and the associated guidance document as well as input from Tusla, who have to implement new systems for implementing the new regulations.

The latest <i>National Review Panel Annual Report 2<\/i>indicates that over the three year period it was notified of 60 deaths (22 in 2010; 15 in 2011 and 23 in 2012).  Further breakdown of cases reviewed indicate the following:<\/p><p>- Seven children were in care at the time of death (2 in 2010; 2 in 2011 and 3 in 2012),<\/p><p>- Eight were receiving aftercare services (4 in 2010; 2 in 2011 and 2 in 2012),<\/p><p>- Forty five were living with their family and known to child protection services (16 in 2010; 11 in 2011 and 18 in 2012).<\/p><p>The report further notes that the highest proportion of notified deaths between 2010 and 2012 concerned children or babies who died by natural causes.  The majority of these (9) were babies whose cause of death was sudden unexpected death in infancy.  The next most common cause for 8 children was complications due to congenital abnormalities, two children died from terminal cancer and two died from complications of serious illness.<\/p><p>Fourteen children and young people died unexpectedly from accidental causes, seven of which were road traffic incidents.  The remaining seven involved accidents of a different nature including fire, domestic accidents involving two small children and one older teenager and two outdoor accidents involving a drowning and a fall.  Six of the young people died from drug overdoses.  In all but one case the young person was found dead and toxicology reports indicated drug misuse.<\/p><p>What is alarming is that the largest number of unexpected deaths was from suicide.  In 2012 nine children and young people up to the age of 20 died by suicide.  One young person was in HSE care at the time of death having been known to HSE services for a very short period.  Three suicide victims were young adults in receipt of aftercare services. It is well acknowledged that adolescence can be a difficult time for some children but especially those who have experienced early adversity. These difficulties present across all areas of a child's life including health, education and in the community.  It is important that people working in these settings know how to identify and support children using a multi-agency approach for those who are experiencing difficulties.<\/p><p>As of December 2012, 24 National Review Panel reports have been published.  While the Panel reported on a number of management and practice weaknesses, there was no case where the review team concluded that action or inaction on the part of the HSE services was a direct contributory factor in the child or young person&rsquo;s death.  The report notes that many of its recommendations have been implemented.  My Department follows up recommendations made in the NRP reports to ensure they are in place.

The report indicated that 196 children had died during this period of over 10 years.  This statistic was reported widely in the media and while the loss of any child is tragic it is important that further context is provided so that the number and causes of child deaths, particularly of children in care, is not exaggerated and that learning is taken and acted upon.  <\/p><p>The Report differentiated between categories of children (children in care at the time of death, young people over 18 receiving an aftercare service and children who had been referred to child protection and welfare services because of concerns but who were living at home).  It also differentiated between deaths from natural causes which were anticipated due to serious illness and disability and non-natural which included deaths related to substance abuse, suicide and accidents.<\/p><p>- 36 children were in care at the time of death (19 were deaths due to natural causes and 17 were non-natural)<\/p><p>- 32 young people were over the age of 18 and in receipt of aftercare services (5 deaths were due to natural causes and 27 were non-natural)<\/p><p>- 128 children were living at home but had been referred to child protection services due to concerns (60 deaths were due to natural causes and 68 were non-natural).<\/p><p>The Report made a number of recommendations for improvement including that any death of a child in care, aftercare or known to child protection services should be reviewed.<\/p><p>Later in 2010, a National Review Panel was established by the Health Service Executive (now the Child and Family Agency) based on guidance published by the Health Information and Quality Authority.

The Panel's 2012 Annual Report notes that it found examples of positive practice at all levels in the majority of cases that it reviewed.

I am aware of the UNHCR&rsquo;s estimates that more than 86,000 persons have left Myanmar\/ Burma on boats since June 2012. I am also aware of the continuing problem of internally displaced peoples within Myanmar. Ireland together with EU partners calls on the Government of Myanmar\/Burma to address the underlying causes of ethnic tensions in Rakhine State - between the ethnically distinct Muslim Rohinga population and the Buddhist Rakhine population - and guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar\/Burma.  Ireland calls for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both communities. Economic integration and interdependency can be a vehicle for cooperation and peace between the communities. A longer-term Government strategy for rehabilitation and reconciliation is required.   The Irish Embassy in Vietnam, which is accredited to Myanmar\/Burma, closely monitors developments, and, in September 2013, Ambassador Damien Cole travelled to Rakhine state to assess the situation on the ground.  Most recently, the Ambassador visited Naypyidaw on 23 May 2014 and met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  At that meeting he expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the situation of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state and humanitarian access to the region.<\/p><p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 May 2014, EU Foreign Ministers approved the establishment of a formal EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue. The first such Dialogue took place in Myanmar on 20 May. Discussions there touched on most topics of concern, in particular discrimination, hate speech and inter-communal violence against the Rohingyas in Rakhine, and in other parts of Myanmar. It also focused on political prisoners, land and labour rights, freedom of expression, and cooperation with international Human Rights mechanisms and in multilateral fora. <\/p><p>  At the dialogue, the EU stressed that continued efforts to achieve ethnic peace and to end discrimination and violence in Rakhine State were absolutely key for the success of Myanmar&rsquo;s continued transition to democracy. The EU encouraged the Myanmar government to address the underlying causes of inter-communal violence, including the status and welfare of the Rohingya and expressed regret that Rohingya could not self-identify during the recent census.  The EU also expressed readiness to cooperate with Myanmar on initiatives which promote inter-communal understanding. <\/p><p>  In March 2014, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted an EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, and urged the Government of Myanmar to step up its efforts to put an end to such remaining human rights violations and abuses. The resolution reiterated the Council&rsquo;s serious concern about the situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine State.<\/p><p>Previously, at the 23rd session of the UN Human Rights Council in May\/June of 2013, Ireland and our fellow Council members urged the government there to grant full citizenship rights to the Rohingya in Rakhine, and review the 1982 citizenship law.<\/p><p>In relation to the UNHCR&rsquo;s call for temporary arrangements to be made for the Rohingya until the situation stabilises   in Rakhine, I would recall that in 2009 82 members of the Rohingya community were settled in Carlow and 5 others were settled in Dublin. The Rohingya had had only limited access to education in refugee and transit camps before arrival in Ireland but despite these disadvantages they are reported to have settled well. <\/p><p>  Currently, the EU is providing around 70 million Euro to the people of Rakhine State, most of which is used to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of the region. The EU will provide 688 million Euro in development aid to Myanmar over the period 2014-2020. The EU will also provide over 46 million Euro in funding to neighbouring states that have received Rohinga people fleeing from Rakhine due to inter-ethnic violence.<\/p><p>  Since 2007, over 7 million Euro has been provided by Irish Aid to NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long term development and emergency and recovery responses in Myanmar\/Burma.

Brazil has, from the beginning, taken a pro-active stand with regard to spreading the benefits of the World Cup, including through the choice of 12 host cities in order to ensure that the benefits of hosting the tournament would not be confined only to wealthier and more developed regions of the country.  It is also my understanding that 100,000 free tickets have been made available to public school students, indigenous communities and the construction workers who helped to build the new stadiums.<\/p><p>  The Brazilian Government&rsquo;s projections are that the 2014 World Cup will increase the country&rsquo;s GDP by almost 10 billion Euro and that, as well as investments in the match stadiums, the World Cup has led to an acceleration of investment in roads, airports and urban mobility projects, including public transportation, new urban roads, bus rapid transit and light rail vehicle systems.  The World Cup is also expected to generate significant employment and revenue in Brazil&rsquo;s tourism sector.  <\/p><p>  Brazil has a strong civil society sector with many non-governmental organisations operating within the country.

Such a review is clearly critical if we are to maintain the prospect of a viable, two-State solution.<\/p><p>  The EU should of course continue to give what support and encouragement it can to a resumption of negotiations, which are the only way to reach a solution. But negotiations for their own sake are of no use, there must be a real commitment to find agreement on the core issues and to make the difficult compromises that inevitably will be involved.<\/p><p>  In my view, the EU should therefore use the influence and leverage at its disposal to give effect to its disapproval of various negative aspects of Israel&rsquo;s continued occupation and policies on the ground, and above all the relentless expansion of settlements. This would build on existing measures such as the non-eligibility of settlement goods for lower tariffs, and the exclusion of settlements from EU research funding.<\/p><p>  One element of that leverage should be the issuing of EU guidelines on labelling of settlement goods. This has been promised at EU level, but was left to one side for the moment while the talks were in progress, for fear of damaging the political atmosphere.

The issue of a passport is, therefore, the culmination of an important and legally-binding process.  The checks and balances within the passport process embrace the standard principles that are provided for in the Act and help to ensure that the person in question is an Irish citizen <i>and<\/i>that the identity of the applicant is known.  This serves to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which, in turn, ensures the safe travel and wellbeing of Irish citizens, as they travel abroad.  Moreover, it helps to combat passport and identity fraud.The Act underpins a long-standing passport policy in regard to the use of verifiable civil documents such civil birth certificates for first-time applicants.  These documents confirm the details of a person&rsquo;s birth name, date and place of birth, all of which are critical components of a person&rsquo;s identity.  The Passport Service received an application from the person in question on 20\/06\/2012.  As part of the standard examination processes, the birth certificate supplied by the applicant was found not to be authentic.  The applicant subsequently produced another birth certificate which has also been confirmed as not a genuine document.  In the circumstances the Passport Service could not be satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and as a result, the application for an Irish passport could not be approved.  The matter has been referred to the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is not questioning the procedures regarding the issuing of naturalisation certificates by the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  Rather, the Passport Service is following the requirements of the Passport Act 2008 to verify the identity of the applicant i.e. that the person who has submitted the application is who they claim to be.  This is the same process followed for all first time applicants e.g. the presentation of an Irish birth certificate alone as obtained from the General Register Office is not acceptable without other forms of identity documents.

It also agreed that the Eurogroup would examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a\u00a0view to further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.<\/p><p>  Since June 2012, we have successfully negotiated the Promissory Notes transaction; a further extension of maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans; and the inclusion of a provision for retroactive recapitalisation on a case by case basis in the operational framework of the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument.<\/p><p>  In February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State, including spreading the cost of the Promissory Notes from a weighted average life of c.7-8 years to c.34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings.<\/p><p>  In April 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022. This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability. It also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing\u00a0by creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.<\/p><p>  There has also been progress on the ESM Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI).

There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.<\/p><p>  On 10 June 2014 the euro area Member States reached a preliminary agreement on the European Stability Mechanism's (ESM) direct recapitalisation instrument (DRI). This now requires a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty and the aim is to have this process completed by November this year. This would allow the ESM DRI to come into effect once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational which is expected to be in November of this year.<\/p><p>  All of these actions are tangible achievements which reduce the burden of Ireland's national debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100055#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100055#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[28283\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100055#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way disputes over who a primary care giver and which parent is awarded the single parent child carer tax credit are determined; if policy is being refined in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[28284\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100055#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if she has undertaken any impact analysis of the change from one-parent family tax credit with a single parent child carer tax credit; if she will commit to examining the possibility of a joint parenting agreement to allow both parents to adequately support their children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.<\/p><p>  As you are aware the One-Parent Family Tax Credit (OPFTC) has been replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Credit from 1 January 2014. The restructured credit is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and also includes the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to the higher rate of income tax arises. However, the credit is more targeted in that it is, in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child. A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child or children is unsustainable.<\/p><p>  The new credit is designed to be an activation measure, which was the original intention behind the OPFTC. It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment. It should not be considered as a supplementary source of income, on which the financial support of a parent depends.<\/p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the OPFTC played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents. However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.<\/p><p>  The person who receives the child benefit payment is being used as the initial indicator by the Revenue Commissioners to identify the individuals who are likely to qualify for the new credit.\u00a0 However, the credit will in the first place go to the person who cares for the child for most of the year. Agreement as to who will be the principal carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians.<\/p><p>  You appear to be suggesting that the credit could be jointly shared between the parents. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that this would prove to be administratively very difficult to implement even where there is agreement among the parents, which is not often the case. In addition, as income and tax arrangements are prone to change it would require that the issue be revisited on at least an annual basis to ensure the correct tax treatment is being apportioned to each party. While a 50\/50 split may suit some taxpayers it would not suit others and determining the exact split for a large number of taxpayers would place an unacceptable administrative burden on the Revenue Commissioners. However, as a result of an amendment that I brought to the measure at Committee Stage, the current legislation allows the parents to agree among themselves to each claim the credit on alternate years provided they meet the qualifying criteria.<\/p><p>  It is essential to regularly review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them. \u00a0While I understand the difficulties being experienced by those that have lost the OPFTC and who have not qualified for the new SPCCC, I am satisfied that the new credit targets limited Exchequer resources to where they are needed most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100055#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100055#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[28507\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100055#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to creating a scheme to provide bridging loans to persons, such as persons with grown up children, who no longer require houses of larger sizes and who would like to trade down but face difficulties to secure the necessary finance due to financial institutions' reluctance to lend to this age group, and in consideration of how such a scheme could improve the housing stock available.","asker":"1110","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>The provision of credit is governed by legislation including, the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010.\u00a0 In addition, Regulated Financial Service Providers must comply with the Consumer Protection Code 2012 when offering, recommending, arranging or providing regulated activities, including mortgages and loans, to consumers.<\/p><p>  The decision on the approval of a\u00a0loan for a borrower must remain a commercial decision for the lending institution concerned and\u00a0as\u00a0Minister for Finance, I have no role in that matter.\u00a0 It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the risks that it is considering when deciding to approve a loan.<\/p><p>  However, chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires lenders to undertake, in particular, a 'Knowing the Consumer' and a 'Suitability and Affordability' assessment before offering, recommending, arranging or providing credit to a consumer.\u00a0As part of such an assessment, lenders are obliged to take into consideration, the consumer's age, known future changes to his\/her circumstances, income, savings, debts and financial commitments.

Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.\u00a0 Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. <\/p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs was unsustainable. If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the recent reform, the tax system is still supporting those who can afford private medical insurance to the tune of around &euro;400 million per annum. Effectively that means that some taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are continuing to provide financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  It is unfair and unsustainable to allow unrestricted tax relief on private medical insurance premiums, particularly at a time when the general population has contributed so much to repairing the public finances.

Specifically, as LPT is a self-assessed tax it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on an assessment of the market value of the property.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that it published extensive guidelines on how to value a property for the purposes of LPT at the time of the 2013 'bulk issue' of Returns to property owners. The guidelines included the booklet 'Your Guide to Local Property Tax', which was inserted with the Returns that issued. The guidelines clearly stated that LPT as a self-assessed tax required property owners to honestly assess the value of their residential property on the valuation date of 1 May 2013, taking into account issues such as the type and age of the property and its state of repair.\u00a0 Once the valuation of the property was confirmed, the property owner was required to select the Property Valuation Band most applicable to the property and to pay the amount due. The Property Band system removes any requirement to calculate a precise valuation figure and on that basis it was anticipated that for the most part change requests in respect of valuations would not occur.<\/p><p>  The valuation, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and is not affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or by any repairs or improvements made to the property during this period. Owners will have the opportunity to re-assess the declared value of the property on the next valuation date, which is 1 November 2016. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the Property Band system, where a property owner has genuinely over-valued and over-paid LPT, then Section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides that a claim for a refund of the overpaid tax can be made to Revenue subject to certain conditions being satisfied. The normal conditions require the property owner to make a submission setting out fully the nature of the error or mistake and explaining the circumstances in which the overpayment arose. Any such submission must include relevant supporting documentation such as professional valuations or relevant house price surveys for the area. The property owner should also indicate whether he\/she relied on Revenue's valuation guidance for the purposes of the self-assessment.<\/p><p>  In regard to the case to which the Deputy refers, I am informed by Revenue that a daughter of the person in question completed the LPT Return on his behalf on 21 May 2013 and clearly indicated Band 4 as the appropriate Valuation Band for the property. The associated Band 4 liability of &euro;202 (half year) was also paid at that time. <\/p><p>  The person subsequently paid his 2014 liability at a Band 2 rate of &euro;225 (full year) and submitted a request to have the original Band 4 rate decreased to Band 2. As already stated, any such request must be supported with back up documentation and while some additional information was provided it was not adequate to support a reduction of 2 Valuation Bands. I am advised that a member of the LPT team actually discussed this issue with a staff member from the Deputy's office on 13 June. The LPT official specifically confirmed that the proposed reduction from Band 4 \u00a0to Band 2 would not be reflective of the valuations applied in the general geographic area and that the information supplied by the person supporting such a reduction was not comparing 'like with like'. <\/p><p>  However, the Deputy's comment in regard to the person's low income is noted. Given the circumstances, a member of the LPT team will make direct contact with the person in the coming days to discuss the valuation issue and the possibility that he may be entitled to a deferral or partial deferral from LPT depending on his income level.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100056#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100056#WRD03250"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[28250\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100056#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of mortgage holders of each financial institution operating here whose repayment schedule and interest rate was either aligned to at the time or due to be converted to an ECB tracker rate at a point in the future who have since converted to a variable rate, waived entitlement to a tracker rate for the period of 2008 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>At the outset, I must confirm to the Deputy that the lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a significant shareholding - are independent commercial entities and, as such, it is a commercial decision for each lender to decide what interest rates to charge customers.

Section 1002 allows Revenue to either directly remove funds from any account held by a financial institution in the name of a defaulting taxpayer, or, to instruct any third party that owes a debt to the defaulting taxpayer to pay those funds directly to Revenue.<\/p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that it never deploys its enforcement powers, including Attachment, without giving the taxpayer every opportunity to engage and agree mutually acceptable solutions, including phased payment arrangements. The enforcement process only commences when the caseworker has exhausted all other options to encourage voluntary compliance. Revenue also has strict guidelines in place, including authorisation at a senior level, to ensure Attachment is only used in appropriate circumstances.<\/p><p>Revenue is always conscious that the use of Attachment Orders can have adverse consequences for taxpayers and it is normally only deployed where other enforcement options have failed to secure the outstanding debt.<\/p><p>In regard to the specific data requested by the Deputy, the number and value of Attachment Orders issued by Revenue and \u00a0the amounts collected on foot of those Orders in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 (to date), and the number that are currently active, is set out in the table in the following appendix.<\/p><p><b>Appendix : Attachment Orders<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of Cases<\/th><th>Number of Referrals<\/th><th>Value of Referrals (&euro;m)<\/th><th>Yield (&euro;m)<\/th><th>No. of Attachments Currently Active<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>4,463<\/td><td>213<\/td><td>30.7<\/td><td>180<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>2,903<\/td><td>4,039<\/td><td>178.5<\/td><td>28.5<\/td><td>202<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>2,989<\/td><td>4,199<\/td><td>173.5<\/td><td>28.6<\/td><td>352<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 (YTD)<\/td><td>1,544<\/td><td>1,972<\/td><td>65.2<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>424<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100057#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Relief Eligibility","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100057#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[28319\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100057#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"whether any assistance or tax incentives are available to first-time buyers who purchased their homes in February 2014 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>The position is that tax relief on interest paid on all qualifying home loans is being phased out.

The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and\/or caretaking) services. The flexible nature of the capitation grant schemes allows individual school authorities to apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services to meet their needs. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established involving my Department, the Department of Finance (now Public Expenditure and Reform), IMPACT and SIPTU with a view to establishing the factual position in schools regarding terms and conditions (including pay) of school secretaries and caretakers and commencing discussions on the proposal of the unions that an interim minimum pay rate should be introduced.

","asker":"1049","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a source of revenue, and the rating system generally, are deeply embedded in the local government system.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.\u00a0 All rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in delivering the public services which are required locally to create the environment in which businesses can prosper.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation (ARV) they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.  Rates are a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.\u00a0 A system having regard to economic factors such as fluctuations in supply and demand, inherent in the property letting market on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.<\/p><p>  The levying of rates on commercial property by reference to movements in the letting market rather than valuation would be a significant change and a departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates by reference to property values. \u00a0The introduction of such a system for rating purposes would not be suitable because supply and demand in the property market can vary significantly from year to year and within and between the various business sectors which would lead to an unstable and volatile valuation base.  Therefore, I have no plans to change the method by which valuations are assessed for rating as such a radical move would represent a significant\u00a0 departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates solely by reference to property values.<\/p><p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 provides for two key elements in the provision and maintenance of the valuation lists for rating - revision and revaluation.  The revision process provides for the updating of valuation lists so that new properties can \u00a0be valued and added to the list, improved and extended properties can have their valuations updated and properties that have been demolished in whole or in part can have their valuations amended or struck out as appropriate.<\/p><p>  Under the current provisions of the Act, an owner\/occupier of an individual business premises who has concerns about the valuation of their property or any part thereof, including its rateability or the method of calculation may, on payment of a statutory fee of &euro;250, apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.\u00a0 A Revision Officer is then appointed, who may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC) has occurred since the property was last revised.\u00a0 MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.\u00a0 The definition, however, does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as road or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.<\/p><p>  The revaluation provisions in the Act provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as road or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system - distributing the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  Following revaluation, there will generally be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy. It is not the purpose of revaluation to increase the total amount of rates collected by local authorities.  In fact, the relevant legislation (Valuation Act, 2001 and the Local Government Business (Improvements Districts) Act, 2006 provides that the commercial rates income of local authorities in the year following revaluation is capped.<\/p><p>  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible.  The revaluation programme began in November, 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas and more recently to the Dublin City and Waterford City and County Council areas.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December, 2007; Fingal was completed in 2009; Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010 and Dublin City and Waterford City and County were completed in December, 2013.  The revaluation of Limerick City and County area is currently underway.  While the Commissioner is exploring a number of initiatives to accelerate the programme, he cannot at present give a date for the commencement of the revaluation of all commercial properties in County Kerry or in other rating authority areas<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100059#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100059#WRG03050"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[27867\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100059#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if there are currently any requirements placed on companies which tender for public contracts to demonstrate that they comply with employment law in respect of the rights and entitlements of their employees; if there is any specific requirement placed on companies which have been found to be in breach of employment law and which subsequently tender for public contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The first stage of the procurement process for a civil works contractor to undertake the works has been commenced by Cork County Council, which is the Contracting Authority for the Scheme. Tender documents are likely to be issued to a shortlisted number of contractors in early August with a contractor expected to be appointed in late 2014, subject to Confirmation of the Scheme i.e. formal approval by my Department as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts.<\/p><p>  In relation to Clonakilty, consultants appointed by OPW are currently working towards developing viable options for a flood relief scheme. <\/p><p>  A second Public Consultation will take place on 2 July, 2014 in Clonakilty to provide an opportunity for members of the public to give their views on the direction the scheme is taking. The OPW expects to be in a position to present the preferred option at the statutory Public Exhibition of the scheme in the Autumn. <\/p><p>  Following the Public Exhibition, the detailed design of the scheme will commence and once this has been completed, procurement of contractors to carry out the works will be initiated. Subject to broad acceptance of the scheme proposals by the public and to successful completion of the tender process, it is hoped that construction will start towards the end of 2015, again subject to Confirmation of the Scheme by my Department. <\/p><p>  With regard to Bandon, detailed design of the flood relief scheme is now almost completed. The first stage of the procurement process for a civil works contractor was commenced in November 2013. However, following a legal challenge the OPW terminated the process. The OPW will recommence the pre-qualification process very shortly. <\/p><p>  The effect of having to re-run the process has meant that construction works are now expected to commence in the first quarter of 2015 rather than the previously anticipated start time of September 2014.  However, the delay in starting the works does not affect the completion date of the Scheme, which will still be programmed for completion towards the end of 2016. The reason for this is that the Scheme requires two summer seasons of channel works due to environmental constraints, and the scheme programme provides that works would take place in the summers of 2015 and 2016. The commencement of construction will of course, be dependent upon Confirmation of the Scheme.<\/p><p>  Construction of each of the schemes is likely to take 18 &ndash; 24 months to complete.

NERA aims to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.<\/p><p>Having regard to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts, it is not possible to provide information on specific cases.  It should be noted, however, that where there is reason to believe that that employees have been paid less than the minimum amount provided by law, NERA seeks to recover unpaid wages, as soon as possible, for all employees (both current and former) in respect of whom the underpayments have been identified.<\/p><p>The recovery of arrears is an important part of any case and is pursued by means of direct engagement with the employer and, where necessary, by the initiation of legal proceedings. In the majority of cases employers pay the arrears due without recourse to such action. Prosecution is, therefore, an important part of enforcement and can be used to deal with employers who refuse to comply with the law. Decisions about prosecuting an employer for breaching employment laws are based on a consistent proportionate and fair assessment of the seriousness of the alleged breach.  Mitigating factors such as the level of cooperation received, the previous history of breaches, whether an employer has rectified the breaches, whether employees have received redress in the form of unpaid wages or other entitlements, are all taken into account in arriving at a decision.<\/p><p>Neither NERA, nor its Inspectors has the power or authority to agree a compromise sum in respect of unpaid wages due to employees, or to negotiate away any part of an employee's legal entitlements.  Unlike cases prosecuted under the National Minimum Act (or those taken under the former Employment Regulation Orders), the legislation at that time governing Registered Employment Agreements did not give the District court, on conviction, the power to direct the employer to pay arrears in respect of breaches of an REA.<\/p><p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 introduced amendments to the enforcement provisions relating to breaches of REAs that were contained in the Industrial Relations Act 1946.

Similarly, the consistent poverty rate for households aged over 65 with one adult was 3.1% and for two adults it was 2.9%.<\/p><p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients, of which over 50,000 have been in payment for more than 18 months. Officials in the Department are working with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to progress the transfer of those customers with long-term housing needs from this Department to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP is designed to bring all long-term social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system to provide a more integrated and streamlined service for households and to give local authorities greater flexibility to provide assistance to those in need of social housing support. One of the key benefits that HAP will bring is the removal of barriers for people currently in receipt of rent supplement in returning to employment which is consistent with the Governments commitments under the Pathways to Work programme.  When fully rolled out, the HAP scheme will accommodate both long term customers currently on the rent supplement scheme and also new applicants who have been assessed by the local authority as having a housing need. Rent supplement will continue to be paid to clients who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support in order to pay their rent. These applicants would not normally require an assessment of housing need and the expectation would be that a return to employment would obviate the need for long term housing support.<\/p><p>  Rent supplement will therefore, over time, return to its original intention of being a short-term payment rather than providing for a longer term housing need. There are no plans to amend the existing payment arrangements under the rent supplement scheme, for what will effectively be required to address a short term need.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that there is a requirement for the operation of both schemes, with HAP providing for customers long term housing needs and rent supplement to provide short term income support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ00600"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[27829\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a domiciliary care allowance application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick.","asker":"1056","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>The person concerned was notified on the 25th June 2014 that her domiciliary care allowance application was successful and that the allowance has been awarded from 1st May 2014. <\/p><p>Payment of the allowance, along with arrears due, will be available in the nominated bank account on the 15th July 2014 and on the third Tuesday of each month thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Appeals","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[27906\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue on a farm assist appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to convene an oral hearing in this case.<\/p><p>Every effort will be made to hear the case as quickly as possible and the appellant will be informed when arrangements for the oral hearing have been made.<\/p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[27907\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100061#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a living alone allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; if the living alone allowance will be backdated to the date of entitlement.","asker":"1056","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>The person concerned applied on 17 February 2014 for an increase for living alone on his State pension contributory (SPC).

Of the 1,379 total, 1,166 are Supervisors and 213 are Assistant Supervisors.  The salaries of CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors are paid by their local CE Sponsoring organisations, who are their legal employers.  Every four weeks during the CE project annual contract, the CE Sponsors can claim for the costs of supervision from the Department of Social Protection at the approved rates.  The Department provides a grant to cover the cost of employing Supervisors for a full-time 39-hour week, exclusive of lunch breaks.  This grant can only be used to fund supervisor wage costs for the 39-hour contractual week.  Any additional scheme work outside of the 39 hours contractual period will not be funded by the Department.<\/p><p>  With regards to pension arrangements for CE supervisors, the Labour Court recommended in July 2008 (LCR19293) that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S, the Agency responsible for CE at that time.  Notwithstanding the position of this Department (which now has responsibility for CE) in rejecting that liability for these costs be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE supervisors.  Given the level of funding that would be required from this Department, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and on-going fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.

As I indicated in that reply, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas.  In that context, I wish to acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's end of year statement for 2013 indicated that the rate of job losses in its client companies had reached a record low.  This was very welcome news indeed. However, while the level of job losses has stabilised, I am very cognisant of the ongoing difficult challenge in creating a sufficient number of new jobs to maintain, and indeed increase, employment levels in the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p>  I met recently with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and discussed its strategic proposal to increase its capital budget over time from the present level of &euro;5.687m to &euro;12m per annum.  I am very aware and supportive of the case advanced by the organisation that such an increase in funding would enable it to create an additional 300 jobs per annum. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, it was announced as part of Budget 2014 that comprehensive reviews of both current and capital expenditure would be undertaken by all Government Departments during 2014.  These reviews underpin the Government's multi-annual budgetary framework and are conducted periodically to re-set Departmental expenditure ceilings in line with emerging Government priorities.  The reviews are currently ongoing and will be considered by Government later this year with a view to underpinning expenditure ceilings for 2015 and beyond, as well as clarifying policy options and informing prioritisation decisions arising from the expenditure ceilings.  Clearly, the capital allocation for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for 2015 will be informed by the outcome of those reviews and within the framework of the Budgetary and Estimates processes later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language Issues","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[28439\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will ask the European Council to end the derogation on the status of the Irish language; his position on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Salmon conservation limits are set similarly for all of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers.  The main criteria used are the size of the river (wetted area) and the latitude.  In addition factors specific to each river are used such as the proportion of one sea winter salmon and multi sea winter salmon in the population and the average weight of these salmon.  Other inputs to calculating conservation limits nationally are proportions of male and female salmon and the average numbers of eggs per female fish. <\/p><p>  The independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for Salmon revised the conservation limits for all rivers for the 2013 scientific advice.  The SSC advice for the Suir for 2013 was that the river was meeting its CL and had a surplus of 2,371 salmon.  On the basis of this advice a Snap net fishery was open, although with a restricted season to facilitate rational exploitation for the smaller surplus of Salmon in that river. <\/p><p>  The SSC advice for the Suir for 2014 was that the river was below its CL and had a deficit of 2,449 salmon.  The opening of a Snap net fishery on the River Suir can only be considered if there is a suitable surplus of salmon (in excess of conservation limit) available for harvest.

MANs are available to licenced telecoms providers to enable them offer high-speed broadband to their retail customers without having to build their own networks. <\/p><p>88 MANs, covering 94 towns, were constructed under the MANs Programme, at a cost of approximately &euro;176m.  The MANs were built in two phases &ndash; 28 MANs were constructed in Phase I between 2002 and 2004 and 60 MANs covering 66 towns were constructed during Phase II between 2006 and 2009.<\/p><p>A Value For Money and Policy Review of Phase I of the MANs Programme in 2007 concluded, inter alia, that the MANs model was not suited to all locations and recommended that towns of a significant size or those that had been earmarked for development under the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) should be prioritised for future investment under the MANs Programme.<\/p><p>In 2008, an evaluation was carried out on 81 towns with a population in excess of 1,500 persons (with reference to the 2006 census figures).  These towns included 28 towns that were originally planned for inclusion in Phase II, which was paused in December 2007, and the 29 towns planned for inclusion in Phase III of the Programme.

","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>Since market liberalisation, the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services are delivered in the first instance through private sector operators who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators. <\/p><p>The National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and<\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government's determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a long term, future proofed infrastructure build with next generation backhaul infrastructure (likely to be primarily fibre based) as the key component underpinning whatever access technology delivers the service (fixed or wireless).  This infrastructure build will extend to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 18 areas in County Kildare have been identified as requiring an intervention.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission's guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years.  In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 39 fibre-based broadband networks in County Kildare, by July 2016.<\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised.  This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>In 2009, with the publication of the Technology Actions to Support the Smart Economy report, my Department identified the possibility of significant economic potential from first mover use of new types of flexible networking technology in a research context.  To this end it put in place the first phase of the Exemplar programme, a test bed facility based on one such new and advanced Irish technology - Optical Packet Switching and Transport (OPST) from Intune Networks.  My Department continues to engage with researchers on an ongoing basis on research projects employing the OPST technology. <\/p><p>The Exemplar test-bed is available to research institutions and commercial companies throughout Ireland who have been using it to develop and trial new technology and innovations, with one leading to the establishment of a new enterprise, FAZ Technologies.  The test-bed has also been used for several large EU funded research projects including FINESCE, ENVIROFI and ADDONAS.  The build-out of a network was always intended as a commercial development by private industry, rather than one funded by the State and while a new network has not evolved, researchers and industry continue to make valuable use of the test bed facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL03000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish National Petroleum Company","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL03050"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[28289\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the functions of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation; the funding it receives from the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. <\/p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The proposed annual PSO levy amount for 2014\/2015 is &euro;327.7 million.  This equates to &euro;63.01 per annum for residential customers, &euro;215.94 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;33.38\/kVA for medium and large customers.<\/p><p>  The biggest driver for the proposed levy rise for 2014-15 is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is currently estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover the allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by the lower international gas prices in evidence since spring 2014.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained for the coming months, it should help to reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay and, in turn, should enable those suppliers to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase.<\/p><p>  The increased costs to industry and households arising from the PSO levy are of concern to me and I have contacted the CER in this regard.  As the main reason for the increase in the levy is a decrease in wholesale electricity prices, I have asked the CER to be vigilant in its market monitoring and to focus particularly on the impact that the reduction in the wholesale price of electricity has on retail prices.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord G&aacute;is Privatisation","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL03450"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[28315\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100063#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the costs associated with the change of name of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to Ervia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Infrastructural developments have ensured that the network is well placed to accommodate gas demand in the medium term.  Currently, some 39% of Irish households are connected to the gas network and a further 18% of households are situated in areas which have access to the network.  It should be noted that Ireland has a low population density with a large proportion of households living in rural areas, in contrast to the situation in other, more densely populated, European countries. <\/p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the statutory, independent body, charged with the assessment and licensing of prospective operators seeking to develop and operate a gas distribution system within the State.

The purpose of the Taskforce was to consider how best to facilitate the delivery of high speed broadband by commercial operators, the appropriate role that Government could play in supporting commercial deployment, and to identify the gap in commercial deployment where the Government may have to intervene. <\/p><p>The report of the Taskforce was published in May 2012 and this critically informed the Government's National Broadband Plan which was published in August 2012.  Full details of the Taskforce membership and its deliberations are available on my Department's website. <\/p><p>Building on the work of the Taskforce, the National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and<\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Engagement with industry is central to the delivery of the objectives of the National Broadband Plan.  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a long term, future proofed infrastructure build with next generation backhaul infrastructure (likely to be primarily fibre based) as the key component underpinning whatever access technology delivers the service (fixed or wireless).  This infrastructure build will extend to locations in every county in the State as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services. <\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department, working closely with telecommunications service providers.  This exercise will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, .  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require a State intervention.  I would point out that the EU Commission's guidelines for the application of State aid rules precludes Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. <\/p><p>I have recently launched a stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention.  This consultation, among other things, seeks views on the proposed criteria to be used in finalising those locations which require a State intervention.  The outcome of this consultation will enable finalisation of the mapping exercise, which I expect will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention.  As part of this process consideration will be given to appropriate measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy once finalised. <\/p><p>Engagement with industry is therefore ongoing and is likely to intensify over the coming months.  Separately, my Department is continuing to meet with industry to address practical measures aimed at facilitating commercial deployment of broadband infrastructure services.  Issues such as road openings and planning have been progressed as part of this initiative.  It is planned to publish recommendations on open access fibre ducting and interior cabling for new residential buildings later this year, which should further facilitate deployment of services.  Industry is also working with the Department in the rollout of various initiatives under the National Digital Strategy.<\/p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100064#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100064#WRM01650"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[28522\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100064#WRM01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 534 and 535 of 11 June 2013, if his officials have ascertained from 3 the services that will be available in NBS areas after August 2014, particularly relating to mobile download limits and satellite fees; if 3 has given any continuing commitment in relation to the mobile base stations deployed under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (trading as &ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.

In addition, under section 108 of the EPA Act, where any noise is so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times as to give reasonable cause for annoyance, then it is open to any person, or group of persons, to bring a complaint to the District Court.

There is provision in the Act for third parties who are adversely affected by a failure on the part of a landlord to enforce tenant obligations to refer a complaint to the PRTB in accordance with the procedures in the Act.\u00a0 However, if an alternative legal course of action is already being pursued, then the PRTB cannot intervene.   <\/p><p>In the case of noise nuisance being caused by local authority tenants, a person should contact the relevant local authority.\u00a0 The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to the type of behaviour that is acceptable, and that which is not. A local authority is empowered, under Section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100065#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Expenditure","counter":685,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100065#WRN01350"},{"type":"question","counter":686,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[27881\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100065#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the controls that will be in place at local level to ensure that allocation of the &euro;250 million Leader funding secured as part of the rural development programme will be targeted, cost-effective and efficient; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":687,"content":"<p>LEADER, a community led local development (CLLD) approach to rural development, has formed part of the policy framework for rural development in Ireland since its inception in the 1990s. In the 2007-2013 programming period, LEADER was the main method of the delivery of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life in rural areas and supporting the diversification of the rural economy through the design and implementation of Local Development Strategies (LDS). It has proven to be an effective tool for supporting the economic and social development of rural communities by providing resources for communities to support their own development. <\/p><p>  The continuation of the LEADER approach in rural areas is critical for the future development of rural Ireland. In this context it is the responsibility of my Department to ensure that all funding allocated under the LEADER elements of the RDP is compliant with the regulatory framework and is expended on the basis of sound financial management practices. My Department is currently working on developing the systems required to ensure that the funding is allocated and spent in the most effective way at a local level for the 2014-2020 period. <\/p><p>  To begin, there will be a two-step Local Action Group selection process that will ensure that all entities interested in delivering a LDS has the required capacity to do so.

These systems will include effective decision making practices to ensure that funding is targeted to maximise its impact.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<\/p><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. <\/p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations. In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. This may include the prohibition or the restriction (e.g. a boil water notice) of the supply by the water supplier. The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions and boil water notices.

In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.7% annually, and for apartments the figure was 10.3%. The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. In 2006, some 93,419 housing units were completed across the country, 19,470 of them in Dublin. In 2013, a total of 8,301 homes were completed nationally , with just 1,360 in Dublin.

I understand, however, that there is an annual open season during which deer can legally be shot under licence.  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners who may apply to the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Permissions are issued by D\/AHG where there is evidence of such damage.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the issues around an increasing deer population, including its effects on agriculture and forestry.  Deer management is complex, with different views held by various stakeholders and addressing deer related problems will require a high degree of agreement, co-operation and concerted action by the stakeholders and Departments concerned.  My Department, together with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, will shortly set up a non-statutory Irish Deer Management Forum, independently chaired with relevant officials from the two Departments as well as other stakeholders representing hunting, farming, forestry and conservation interests. <\/p><p>  My Department has received complaints about growing deer numbers in certain parts of the country and putative associations with higher levels of Bovine TB have been alleged.  However, my Department&rsquo;s belief is that, in so far as TB is concerned, the underlying problem in these areas is driven primarily by badgers and not by deer.  In fact, research has shown that deer as a species are not particularly effective as maintenance hosts for TB except when numbers are high.  In this context, an exercise conducted in 2007-2008 focused on TB strain-typing in cattle, deer and badgers, found a significantly higher prevalence in badgers than in either cattle or deer. <\/p><p>  With respect to TB in deer in Kerry, in the period since January 2011, samples from only 4 deer have been submitted through my Department&rsquo;s regional veterinary laboratories as suspect TB.  These samples were examined and cultured but TB was not confirmed in any deer (parasitic lesions and localised abscesses).  My Department therefore has no recent evidence to substantiate claims that the deer in Kerry are responsible for transmission of TB to cattle.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the complaints about high levels of TB in particular areas, there has been a very significant improvement in TB incidence in cattle over the past number of years: herd incidence has fallen from 5.9% in 2008 to 3.9% in 2013. The number of reactors has declined from 30,000 to 15,600 during the same period. While it is difficult to attribute the downward trends exclusively to a single factor, my Department believes that much of the improvement in the TB situation, in recent years, is attributable to the effective implementation of the badger removal programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100067#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100067#WRP03450"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[28217\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100067#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if all outstanding moneys due under the disadvantaged area scheme for 2013 will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if contact will be made by his Department with the person.","asker":"1056","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":827,"content":"<p>I can confirm that officials from my Department are in ongoing contact with the person named, most recently on 23 June 2014, following which outstanding documentation in relation to the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application of the person named is awaited.

Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers.  Total live exports to date this year are over 154,000 head of which 26,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 2,400 head or 10% up on the comparable period in 2013.  Of this 26,000, some 19,100 went to Northern Ireland, which is an increase of 3% on the same period in 2013.<\/p><p>  However, the potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. This therefore decreases the attractiveness of animals born or reared in the Republic.<\/p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term. Nevertheless Bord Bia will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  In addition, Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity. <\/p><p>  I hosted two roundtable discussions with key stakeholders in the beef sector on 17 April and 3 June, at which these matters were discussed.

Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentenced prisoners by the Parole Board. It is important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive a transfer to an Open Centre even if the recommendation is to that effect. The criteria considered for the transfer of prisoners from closed prisons to open centres include: the safety of the public (specifically flight risk in the case of open centres); compassionate and humane considerations (including facilitating family visits); nature and gravity of the offence; length of sentence served to date; length of sentence left to serve; prior record on temporary release; behaviour in prison; previous criminal history; family support; addiction issues\/history; prisoner's home address.  Prisoners serving short sentences, i.e. under 12 months, can be moved to an open centre shortly after committal. Other longer term prisoners being prepared for the transition back into the community can be considered for moves with about 2 years left in their sentence.

Under these statutory complaints structures the Law Society is, therefore, the main route of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors, outside of the courts. The Society&rsquo;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints in relation to misconduct, inadequate services or excessive fees made directly to it by members of the public. The Society provides guidance on &ldquo;making a complaint&rdquo; on its website, www.lawsociety.ie.<\/p><p>The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or made directly by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. In more serious cases, where the Tribunal considers that a solicitor should be suspended or struck off it will make such a recommendation to the President of the High Court. Further details are available on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website www.distrib.ie.<\/p><p>Members of the public who are dissatisfied with the way the Law Society has dealt with a complaint may also refer it to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (www.independentadjudicator.ie). The Office of the Independent Adjudicator was established to provide an independent point of contact to which members of the public could have recourse if dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society had dealt with a complaint. It is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the original complaint.<\/p><p>In addition to the  remedies available under the statutory complaints handling framework that I have just outlined, aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts. This typically arises in cases of negligence on the part of a solicitor which have had serious negative consequences for the client concerned. As with any court proceedings, it is considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case and its possible cost implications. It will then be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to the circumstances of their particular complaint. It is also understood that the Law Society maintains a list of solicitors who are prepared to act in such negligence proceedings against another solicitor and this list can be obtained upon request.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that in order to be permitted to practice by the Law Society, individual solicitors are obliged to have Professional Indemnity Insurance to cover such instances of negligence as those raised by the Deputy.

There will be a new complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council backed up by a Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal.

The primary consideration in any vetting process is to ensuring the safety of children and vulnerable adults and as such vetting processes demand rigorous procedures to ensure their integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service. To that end full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.  <\/p><p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction. Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.<\/p><p>  There are, however,  certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.

I am informed by the Commissioner that, in general, the target time for processing asylum applications is 9 to 10 weeks. <\/p><p>The Refugee Applications Commissioner is statutory independent in the exercise of his functions. The Commissioner has advised that it is the policy of the office to ensure that applications for refugee status are processed as speedily as possible in the context of the available staffing resources and other priorities within the Office.  Accordingly, the number of staff available for processing can vary  and is augmented from time to time by staff from other  units as resource redeployment permits. There is also a network of support staff who carry out a variety of application processing related functions  such as  taking applications for asylum, scheduling interviews, arranging interpretation  and translation, issuing recommendations, dealing with Judicial Reviews, processing of Dublin Regulation cases and so forth<b>.  <\/b>These staff also perform similar  functions for other areas of the work in ORAC, including Subsidiary Protection, and accordingly, it is not possible to separate out the time spent on asylum cases exclusively.  The overall resources of the office are kept under review taking into account the demand led nature of the work of the Office.  <\/p><p>The median processing time for asylum applications in 2014 (to end April) is 12.1 weeks. Various strategies are being advanced to manage processing times in ORAC including the scheduling of some Saturday interviews.<\/p><p>The median processing time to a final decision by the Minister on an asylum application in 2013 to include the appeals process in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) was 36 weeks. Some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and other relevant statutory provisions.  High quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process. <\/p><p>Persons who are refused refugee status are notified of their entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process. This is invariably followed by the so-called leave to remain process. Each of these processes which determine whether an applicant can remain in the State are hugely complex and subject to oversight by the courts and have to be examined in accordance with a large body of Irish and international law. There are no shortcuts as the outcomes can lead to the most fundamental life-changing event for the applicants.  <\/p><p>Measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of protection applications. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the ORAC with appeals to be dealt with by the RAT.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, <i>inter alia<\/i>, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality, to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising, in the shortest possible timeframe  consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising. <\/p><p>The Government remains committed to legislative reform in this area as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with. In this regard, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection is a key priority for this Government. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[28108\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide a breakdown of the number of persons since 2000 who have been and are currently in direct provision centres; the number of applications for asylum processed each year to date; and if she will provide a breakdown, by number of years, of the time spent by residents in direct provision centres before their applications are processed.","asker":"1178","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":970,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[28179\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons in the direct provision system for less than six months; between six and 12 months; in excess of one, two, three, four, five, six and seven years, respectively; the corresponding figures for children; the specific steps being taken to address the delays in processing immigration applications involving persons in direct provision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":971,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 422 together.<\/p><p>The direct provision system is managed by the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department.

More detailed information on the breakdown of costs associated with the Direct Provision system can be found in RIA Annual Reports on its website - www.ria.gov.ie.  For example, the 2013 RIA Annual Report shows that RIA paid &euro;45.735m to private contractors in respect of commercially owned centres and &euro;6.901m to private contractors in respect of the management of State-owned centres.<\/p><p>Of the 34 centres currently under contract to RIA, 7 are State owned i.e. the land and buildings are owned by the State.  Whilst all centres are managed by private companies under contract to RIA, the rates paid by RIA takes into account the differing costs undertaken directly by these companies, depending on whether it is a State owned or privately owned centre.  A key element of these contracts is the rates paid by RIA on a per person per day (PPPD) basis.  This rate does not distinguish between adults and children.<\/p><p>As has been stated in answers to previous D&aacute;&iacute;l Questions, details of <i>current<\/i>contract rates are not provided. The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, e.g. at the end of January, 2013 the records are updated to end of December 2010.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.   <\/p><p>Nonetheless, it is possible to give a general indication of the rates currently paid. As mentioned above, these rates are on a per person per day (PPPD) basis. Currently, the average PPPD rate for direct provision centres is &euro;29.49 while the same contract rate for State-owned centres averages at &euro;15.50.  <\/p><p>The two PPPD rates cited above are not directly comparable.  The direct provision rate is a single all-inclusive figure  which includes, <i>inter alia,<\/i>energy, maintenance, transport and VAT costs. By contrast, the State-owned rate does not include any of these costs, which are borne directly by the State and not by the contracted management company. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the direct provision system is only one element of the State&rsquo;s response to its international obligations on the asylum issue. The system is based on the principle of mainstream service provision so that residents receive the same health and community welfare supports as the general population. As regards education, children of asylum seekers are linked to local mainstream primary and post-primary schools as well as ECCE pre-school placements in a like manner to the general population.  As well as these educational, health and welfare costs, there is the asylum determination system itself, as well as the downstream judicial and policing costs.  All countries which take their responsibilities in this area seriously are faced with similar calls on their financial resources.  For example, it was estimated that in the period 2005 to 2009 inclusive, the total amount spent across the whole of Government on asylum seekers was &euro;1,275.31 million, of which &euro;424.43 million was spent on the direct provision system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":977,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS01950"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[28115\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the plans in place to improve access to higher education and training for young persons in direct provision centres.","asker":"1178","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":979,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum \/ protection applicants in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.

The remainder are for the most part processed within one week with a small amount of more complex cases taking up to 15 days. This time frame is of course dependent on all the required documentation being provided with no queries remaining outstanding. <\/p><p>As a result of a number of initiatives which my Department has introduced, the number of short stay visas (including visas for tourism purposes) granted to Chinese nationals has grown steadily from just over 7,300 in 2011 to over 8,100 in 2013, an 11% increase. The approval rate for visa applications from China is 92% which compares very favourably internationally. The grant rate for Chinese nationals overall i.e. including applications made outside China is even higher at 95%.  <\/p><p>These initiatives offer Chinese nationals who wish to travel to Ireland as tourists with a number of options. For example, the Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme, introduced with effect from 1 July 2011, has proved to be very successful in facilitating Chinese nationals who wish to visit Ireland. The Programme applies to holders of UK short stay visas from eighteen selected countries, including China, and allows visitors, who are in possession of a UK visa, to travel on to Ireland without the need to apply for a separate Irish visa. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in their latest report on the impact of the Programme estimate that there has been an additional 12,700 visits to Ireland by Chinese nationals, between July 2011 and October 2013, as a direct result of the Programme i.e. in addition to the growth in those visiting the State using Irish visas.  <\/p><p>Chinese nationals can also apply for a visa as part of an Approved Destination Scheme (ADS) Group Tour, for an individual tourist visa or for a visit visa which is normally used for visiting family members. Several measures have been introduced in the last number of years to encourage this type of tourist to Ireland resulting in an ADS visa being now one of the most straightforward and quickest Irish visas to obtain with processing times being less than five working days normally. In recognition of the growing number of affluent and independent tourists from China, a scheme to enable independent Chinese travellers to come to Ireland was introduced in November 2011. This category of visa application is processed within 10 working days. All processing times are, of course, dependent on the required supporting documentation being provided by the applicant. To help with this, application guidelines for all visa categories are published on the Irish Embassy website in English and Chinese. <\/p><p>The Government has also taken other steps to make the visa process easier, including, with effect from 1 August, 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for Chinese business travellers and regular family visitors.  This regime compares favourably with the approach taken by our nearest competitors.  For example, it allows for a multi-entry visa for 3 years for &euro;100 for qualifying travellers which compares with the $180 charged by the USA for the same duration.  In addition, agreed programmes aimed at short stays for the purpose of learning English in Irish colleges, with accelerated processing of applications and reduced formalities, have been introduced.<\/p><p>Whilst I am satisfied that Ireland compares favourably with international competitors regarding processing times and approval rates for visas from China, I continue to seek, with my officials in INIS, ways in which the visa regime may be enhanced in order to encourage and facilitate tourism to Ireland, especially from emerging markets such as China.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement of the launch of a joint visa initiative between the UK and Ireland, the &quot;British Irish Visa Scheme&quot; which will, from the autumn of this year, allow tourist and business visitors from China to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK on the basis of a single visa. <\/p><p>This initiative represents a major evolution of the Common Travel Area arrangement and an historic breakthrough in developing the CTA to its natural conclusion where visas issued by either country will be mutually recognised.   While making travel to the CTA easier for Chinese citizens, the scheme will bring benefits for the entire island of Ireland as, for the first time, visa required visitors to Ireland and the UK will be able to move freely between North and South using a single visa.  By removing the need for Chinese visitors travelling to the UK and Ireland to obtain separate visas the number of visitors from there to the island of Ireland is expected to increase very significantly. <\/p><p>In relation to the arrangements for visa applications by holders of public affairs, or &quot;official&quot;, passports, all such applications are processed by the Beijing Visa Office through a special arrangement with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  The Beijing office has an excellent working relationship with the Ministry and applications received from there are prioritised and expedited.  In addition, the normal requirements for supporting documentation are significantly reduced.  As an example, in preparation for a recent high level visit to Ireland from China, 83 applications were processed within 24 hours.  <\/p><p>No complaint of the type referred to by the Deputy has been made against officials of my Department - either based here or in China.  Officials assigned to consular offices abroad are selected from the staff of my Department following a competitive interview process and do not only handle visa processing but are also involved with important promotional activities for Irish tourism and business in China.  A number of visiting Government Ministers have specifically praised their role in such activities. The staff also develop and implement necessary risk profiling and document verification skills locally.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":994,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS03150"},{"type":"question","counter":995,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[28149\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100070#WRS03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will request the acting Garda Commissioner to ensure additional Garda personnel are deployed to an area (details supplied) in Dublin 13; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":996,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts.

For example, in relation to families, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department processes the entire family unit together. However, a number of different members of the family can be at different stages of the process. This can arise for a number of different reasons - one family member appeals to their case to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) while another does not. Also, in many cases, a Judicial Review can be instigated by one family member (often a child) to an asylum decision while the remainder of the family will either be at Subsidiary Protection or Leave to Remain stage. However, INIS will await the outcome of the Judicial Review process as it endeavours at all times to keep the family unit together for processing. The Deputy will appreciate the desirability of having the cases of all family members brought to finality, be the outcome favourable or unfavourable, at the same time.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to have all outstanding cases brought to finality as soon as it is possible to do so. I should add that this position applies equally to persons residing in Direct Provision accommodation as well as those residing elsewhere. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of subsidiary protection applications.  The European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) with appeals to be dealt with by the RAT.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality, to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising, in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising. To date significant progress has been made with this caseload. Over 1500 applicants for subsidiary protection have indicated their wish to proceed and the process of interviewing applicants began in December 2013. By the end of June, around 700 applicants had been scheduled for interview. The ORAC has also begun the process of issuing determinations.<\/p><p>  In the context of cases currently at the leave to remain stage of the process, particular attention is paid to those cases which are awaiting a decision for the longest periods as well as the cases of persons with a history of criminality.<\/p><p>  The Government remains committed to legislative reform in this area as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with. In this regard, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection is a key priority for this Government. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100071#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Upward Only Rent Reviews","counter":1029,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100071#WRT01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1030,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[28428\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100071#WRT01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to review the possibility of introducing legalisation to tackle the issue of upward only rent reviews; if she is not able to do this, will she look at the possibility of holding a referendum to tackle such reviews; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1031,"content":"<p>It will be recalled that the Government made the difficult decision in December 2011 not to proceed with the commitment in the Programme for Government to abolish upward only rent reviews in so called &quot;legacy leases&quot;, i.e., those entered into before 28 February 2010.   There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.

Contrary to the Deputy's assertion, the cumulative effect of Ireland's tobacco control legislation to date has been a decrease in the number of people smoking.  In 2013, the National Tobacco Control Office reported that 21.5% of Irish adults smoked (22.9% men and 20.2% women).  This represents a decline of 2.2% since 2010, and a decline of 7.5% since 2007 when the last comprehensive large scale study on smoking prevalence in Ireland was undertaken (SLAN study).  <\/p><p>Two of the initiatives specifically mentioned by the Deputy, the ban on packets containing less than 20 cigarettes and the ban on the display and advertising of tobacco products, were specifically aimed at young people and the research bears out their success.  Data on smoking among school-aged children indicates a clear downward trend.  The Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey (2010) found that 27% of children reported that they had ever smoked tobacco - a 9% decrease from the 2006 Survey.  There was a reduction of 9.2% in the number of children who said they were current smokers; 80% of 15 to 17 year olds said they <i>do not<\/i>smoke and nearly 90% of 12 to 17 year olds <i>do not<\/i>smoke.<\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that ten years after the ban on smoking in the workplace, there is now concrete evidence of its effectiveness.  Research has found that the ban resulted in 3,726 fewer smoking related deaths than would have been expected if the ban had not been brought in.  The smoking ban was also associated with a number of immediate reductions in ill-health in the general population<\/p><p>- an immediate 13% decrease in all-cause mortality<\/p><p>- a 26% reduction in ischaemic heart disease<\/p><p>- a 32% reduction in stroke, and<\/p><p>- a 38% reduction in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).<\/p><p>It is important to state that the introduction of standardised packaging is just one of a suite of measures that are being and will be implemented in Ireland to reduce the number of people smoking and as such this initiative should not be looked at in isolation.  <i>Tobacco Free Ireland<\/i>, the latest policy document in the area, sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free by 2025.  In practice, this will mean a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%.  <i>Tobacco Free Ireland<\/i>addresses a range of tobacco control issues and initiatives and contains over 60 recommendations, including the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products.

However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are satisfied that the standardised packaging legislation will not have a significant impact on their work in relation to illicit trade in tobacco products.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that the tax stamp is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged.  Tax stamps will remain a fixture on tobacco products following the introduction of standardised packaging, and contain all features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting. <\/p><p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners.  They have extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and in addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.  Research carried out by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with the HSE National Tobacco Control Office, indicates that contraband represents the majority of illicit cigarettes and not counterfeit products.  Figures from 2013 indicate that the proportion of smokers classified as having an illegal pack was 12%, representing a decrease of 4% since 2009.  These findings indicate that the level of consumption of illicit product is being contained, although Revenue remains determined to confront the illegal trade in tobacco products, to optimise levels of seizures of illicit tobacco product and to pursue those found to be involved in this illegal activity.  <\/p><p>  In addition to this the 2014 EU Tobacco Products Directive sets out provisions to be adopted by Member States in relation to traceability and security features of tobacco products.  Tobacco products will be marked with a unique identifier and security features.  This will allow for their movements to be recorded and for such products to be tracked and traced throughout the EU.  This will also facilitate the verification of whether or not tobacco products are authentic.<\/p><p>  Following Government approval, Ireland's Permanent Representative to the United Nations signed the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, adopted by the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), in New York on 20th December 2013.  The new international treaty is aimed at combating illegal trade in tobacco products through control of the supply chain and international cooperation.  As a key measure, Parties commit to establishing a global tracking and tracing system to reduce and eventually eradicate illicit trade.<\/p><p>  In view of the above it is anticipated that illicit trade of tobacco will not increase as a result of the introduction of standardised packaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Control Measures","counter":1302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1303,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[28222\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to any evidence of international best practice in the context of plain cigarette packaging, apart from Australia; to what extent this evidence has been incorporated into the new Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1304,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question, which gives me the opportunity to draw my colleagues' attention to the wealth of evidence available to support the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products.  In preparing the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014, my Department commissioned an international expert in the field, Prof. David Hammond, to carry out an <i>Evidence Review on Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products<\/i>.  Prof Hammond's review found that the evidence on standardised packaging has rapidly evolved and is now notable for its breadth and diversity.  Research has been conducted in 10 different countries, using a range of methodologies, including consumer perceptions, eye-tracking technology, neuroimaging, measures of consumer demand and behavioural tasks. <\/p><p>Prof Hammond's review unequivocally found that tobacco packaging is a critically important form of tobacco promotion, particularly in countries like Ireland which have comprehensive advertising and marketing restrictions.  The evidence showed that standardised packaging:<\/p><p>- reduces false beliefs about the risks of smoking, <\/p><p>- increases the efficacy of health warnings, <\/p><p>- reduces consumer appeal among youth and young adults, and <\/p><p>- may promote smoking cessation among established smokers.<\/p><p>Overall, Prof Hammond found that there is very strong evidence that standardised packaging would be effective with regard to four of Ireland's tobacco control policy objectives, namely:<\/p><p>- preventing children and young people from starting to smoke, <\/p><p>- encouraging current smokers to quit, <\/p><p>- reducing the risk of those who have quit from relapsing, and <\/p><p>- encouraging the denormalisation of smoking in society, thereby protecting children from the marketing practices of the tobacco industry. <\/p><p>Two systematic reviews of the research evidence covering 54 studies were published by Moodie <i>et al<\/i>in 2012 and in 2013.  These reviews, and other studies, suggest that standardised packaging can:<\/p><p>- Reduce the appeal of tobacco products, for both adults and children.<\/p><p>- Increase the noticeability, recall and impact of health warning messages; and<\/p><p>- Reduce the ability of packaging to mislead consumers into believe that some products are less harmful than others.<\/p><p>Moodie's review concluded that the evidence shows that standardised packaging: &ldquo;has the potential to contribute to reductions in the harm caused by tobacco smoking now and in the future&rdquo;.  In the UK, Sir Cyril Chantler's independent review on <i>Standardised packaging of tobacco<\/i>also indicated overwhelming support for the measure.  In reviewing the evidence, Sir Chantler made a connection between exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion and the likelihood of taking up smoking, particularly among children.  He concluded that branded packaging contributes to increased tobacco consumption.  In his judgment, the evidence shows that standardised packaging is very likely to have a positive impact on public health by causing &ldquo;a modest but important reduction over time on the uptake and prevalence of smoking&rdquo;. <\/p><p>A year on from the introduction of plain packaging in Australia, we have a limited amount of research on the effects of the policy.  One study found that following the introduction of plain packaging and larger pictorial warnings on packs, smoking in outdoor areas declined by 23%.  It also found that personal pack display (where packs are clearly visible on tables) declined by 15%, particularly in venues where children were present.  Another Australian study found a 78% increase in the number of calls to the smoking cessation helpline.  This increase was due to the introduction of plain packaging.  The researchers found it was not attributable to other causes, such as anti-tobacco advertising or cigarette price increases. <\/p><p>The UK has now announced that it is minded to introduce regulations to provide for standardised packaging following a short consultation.  This consultation was initiated on 26th June.  As the Deputy will be aware, Australia was the first country in the world to introduce this measure in December 2012 and we are in on-going contact with our Australian colleagues to ensure our initiative benefits from their experience.  New Zealand initiated the legislative process to introduce standardised packaging in February 2014, and Scotland has also indicated its intention to follow suit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Antimicrobial-Resistant Infections Incidence","counter":1305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1306,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[28235\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in respect of the World Health Organization's report on the overuse of antibiotics, if vigorous and urgent actions are in place in Ireland as well as in conjunction with other countries to deal with this threat. ","asker":"1183","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1307,"content":"<p>The rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is universally recognised at global, European and national levels as one of the greatest potential threats to human and animal health with possible serious consequences for public health.  The emergence of resistance is a normal biological phenomenon, but the extensive use, misuse and overuse of antimicrobials (antibiotics) in both human and animal health have increasingly raised levels of antimicrobial resistance &ndash; in all countries and in patients of all age groups; with increasing travel and trade, drug resistance can spread rapidly.  The societal and financial costs of treating antimicrobial-resistant infections places a significant burden on society and patients infected with drug-resistant organisms are more likely to remain in hospital for a longer period of time and to have a poor prognosis. <\/p><p>Ireland welcomes and has supported the leadership and work of the WHO over many years in addressing the impact of the overuse of antibiotics, specifically the work of the WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Antimicrobial Resistance which recommends that the WHO should lead the development and coordination of a global action plan on antimicrobial resistance and the publication in April 2014 by the Organisation of its first global report on antibiotic resistance: Antimicrobial Resistance Global Report on Surveillance 2014.  Ireland and the EU fully supported the passing of the AMR Resolution at the WHO's 67<sup>th<\/sup>World Health Assembly in May 2014 which stressed the need for global action under WHO leadership.<\/p><p>In Ireland the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR has been a significant patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health for several years.  A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years including improved surveillance of infections and prescribing, infection prevention and control processes, antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness raising and with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.<\/p><p>The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in the control and prevention of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) (which arise in part from the overuse of antibiotics) for a number of years, including:<\/p><p>- SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland) which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001.<\/p><p>- HSE 'Say No to Infection' which focused on both HCAIs and AMR, launched in 2007<\/p><p>- The RCPI (Royal College of Physicians of Ireland) &amp;amp; HSE National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010 to provide expert advice nationally<\/p><p>- Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals <\/p><p>- HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012<\/p><p><i>- S. aureus <\/i>bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital<\/p><p>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<\/p><p>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<\/p><p>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)<\/p><p>Ireland reports to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARS-Net) and to ESAC, the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption in Europe.  All Irish hospital labs participate in EARS-Net, representing 100% coverage of the population.<\/p><p>The overall aim of the National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR, referenced above, is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance.  Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients, these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines\/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients\/residents\/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented.<\/p><p>As I have stated in the House on previous occasions, the prevention HCAIs and colonisation\/infection of  patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms  such as MRSA is one of my priorities in protecting patient safety.  HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased healthcare costs.  The prevalence of MRSA has dropped considerably in recent years.  There has been a decrease of 62.5% in reported cases of MRSA from 2006 to 2013 and the downward trend appears to be holding for the first quarter of 2014 (figures are provisional). <\/p><p>While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland, MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland.  It must be noted that  there are concerns about the rates of resistance of other organisms and ongoing high antimicrobial consumption.  The most recent European Antimicrobial Surveillance System Report (EARS - Net) for Quarter 1, 2014 was published on June 25th.  The full Report is available at .<\/p><p>In December last I launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus <\/i>(MRSA).  This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes\/long stay residential units and the community.  A third national Guideline on Surveillance, Diagnosis and Management of Clostridium <i>difficile <\/i>Infection in Ireland was launched in June 2014.<\/p><p>I might add that I have ensured that Patient Safety has been made a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Data","counter":1308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1309,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[28253\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100076#WRY02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of consultant positions vacant as of 25 June 2014 in each public and voluntary hospital; the number of these positions currently being filled by locums; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, I understand that the manufacturer of Fampyra supplied the drug free of charge to some patients who were prescribed the drug by their clinician.  The manufacturer has recently decided to stop supplying the drug free of charge and, as a consequence, these patients are now faced with financing the drug themselves if they wish to continue with this drug treatment.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes.  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine (Fampyra&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  <\/p><p>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<\/p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes.  However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS.  The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the product which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs scheme.  The HSE has met with Biogen Idec recently to discuss a potential revised application.  The HSE expects that Biogen Idec will submit a revised application.  The HSE will then re-consider the application in as timely a fashion as possible in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100078#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultants Recruitment","counter":1405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100078#WRAA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1406,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[28425\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100078#WRAA01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of applicants that have applied for the vacant consultant dermatologist post at Waterford University Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1092","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1407,"content":"<p>As this question relates to an operational matter, I have referred it to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100078#WRAA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":1408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100078#WRAA01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1409,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[28431\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070100078#WRAA01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if and when a medical card review will be completed in the case of the spouse of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1410,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

This brought order to what had been the system of ad-hoc arrangements in lieu of formal adoption procedures up to this point.

However historic private arrangements for obvious reasons and due to social factors of the era, operated in conditions of great secrecy and there were rarely any contemporary written records of these events. Similarly, the issue of illegal adoptions relates to illegal registrations, i.e., children who were given at birth to other individuals who registered these children as their own and who are now unable to access personal records and information.  The issue of illegal registrations of births are a matter for the General Registration Office which is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection however the Adoption Authority of Ireland may also be able to provide assistance in this regard.<\/p><p>  Records in relation illegal birth registrations, where such records exist, are currently held by a number of  agencies, including the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Child and Family Agency  and also by private adoption agencies,  maternity hospitals, private individuals and other sources.

The Authority  has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s  Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records. <\/p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register which is operated by the Adoption Authority was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.
