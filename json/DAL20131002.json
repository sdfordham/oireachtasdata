The Central Bank is warning of a &euro;9.3 billion mortgage debt mountain.  The Governor is very unhappy with the response of the banks to this particular crisis which is causing immense distress to thousands of families, affecting their capacity in terms of day-to-day living.<\/p><p>  He confirmed that, at the end of June, 74,000 of the 98,000 mortgage holders in arrears for more than 90 days were not yet in arrangements with their lenders.  Effectively, 75% of distressed mortgages are not being dealt with.  That is an extraordinary revelation by the Central Bank Governor and causes deep concern across the country.  He also accused the main banks of engaging in wishful thinking that the mortgage arrears crisis would cure itself.  What is more alarming is that not only are the banks not moving fast enough to tackle the problem but that the majority are going down the repossession or surrender route.  Almost two thirds of mortgage holders in arrears have been threatened with legal action.  Of the 35,000 proposed resolutions offered by the banks by the end of June, 62% referred to surrender or repossession of property.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach has said time and time again that repossession would be the last resort.  We now know that repossession and evictions are the first resort, not the last as promised by the Government.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and establish an independent office to deal with this issue once and for all and ensure those in mortgage arrears get a fair hearing from their banks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200003#A00100","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1380706200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>First, the entire mortgage and banking crisis is the central issue of the legacy this Government inherited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200003#A00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1380706200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Change the tape.

This Government has signed on to meet particular objectives and targets and we will not shirk that responsibility, but we do not intend to go beyond it.  A fundamental aspect of the programme for Government is that there will not be any income tax increases.  Deputy Adams's assertion that people will be faced with that is untrue.  This will be vindicated by the Minister for Finance as part of the programme for Government when he presents his budget on 15 October.  It is very challenging.<\/p><p>  I note this week's reports that consumer confidence is at its highest level for the last six years, with an average of 3,000 jobs per month being created, and we have had 14 consecutive months of drops in the live register.

This is in the context of huge reductions already, from &euro;1.5 billion in 2008 to &euro;585 million in 2013.  Recent figures for waiting lists for local authority housing have reached the shocking number of approximately 100,000 or, to be precise, 98,318.  The level of social housing building in Ireland is at zero.  Local authority housing has been decimated.  The local authorities' budget for house building has been reduced from &euro;367 million in 2010 to a paltry &euro;65 million in 2013.  Capital funding for voluntary and co-operative housing this year has been cut by &euro;15 million, from &euro;70 million to &euro;55 million, a reduction of 21%.  The public house building programme is almost non-existent and because of this, the numbers on housing waiting lists have increased hugely, from 56,000 in 2008 to 98,000 - the most recent figure - an increase of 40,000 families languishing on housing waiting lists.  The Government has abandoned the social housing building programme.  This is another reason the Labour Party is at 6% in the polls.  It had a proud record in providing local authority housing, but it has done a U-turn on this issue also.  What is happening is that house building has been privatised and developers and landlords are being paid, instead of putting the money into building houses.  They are being paid through schemes such as the rent supplement scheme and the paying of mortgages over and over again through the rental accommodation scheme and the long-term leasing scheme.  In view of the huge numbers languishing on local authority house waiting lists, will the Taoiseach agree that a major public house building programme should be commenced by the Government?  Such a programme would provide a major stimulus for the economy, create thousands of jobs, provide badly needed homes for families on waiting lists, reduce social welfare expenditure and save money.  Will the Government immediately commence a major house building programme for the 100,000 families languishing on housing waiting lists?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200005#C01500","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1380707400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.

The various organisations representing the industry have repeatedly called for action to deal with the problem of rogue drivers.  It is generally accepted that there is a massive oversupply of taxis as a result of the completely uncontrolled deregulation of the industry overseen by a previous Government.  It has led to an extremely difficult, if not disastrous, situation for taxi drivers.  The very least they require is legal support for a regime which ensures that all drivers are properly qualified and licensed.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State indicated to me before the debate that he accepts the thrust of this amendment and assured me there is now a regulation in place to achieve the same end.  The taxi drivers to whom I have spoken, however, have asked me to put it to him that this requirement should be set out clearly in the legislation for the avoidance of any ambiguity.  Their strong preference for explicit legislative provision arises from the failure, certainly from their perspective, of regulation in the past.  Even where regulations have been in place, the strong view among people in the industry is that they have not been enforced.  A specific provision in the Bill, as set out in amendment No. 1, would offer an important assurance to legitimate drivers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200008#F01700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1380709200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I support the amendment and agree that the requirement regarding licensing and insurance should be set out in a categoric way in the legislation.  There is concern among taxi drivers that the nature of the business lends itself to an unregulated element.  To clarify one point made by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, deregulation was not, as such, a decision by a previous Government but had more to do with a court case decision which found that the existing legislative provisions were a problem from a consumer perspective.  It is not a major point, but it does no harm to clarify it.<\/p><p>  Anything we can do in this legislation to reflect the desire of Members on all sides of the House to ensure we have a properly regulated taxi industry should be done.  It should be seen as a full-time profession, not a go-to sector for part-time operators and fly-by-nights without proper qualifications.<\/p><p>It should allow those who decide to take part in the profession to make a meaningful existence, carry on their business and raise a family the same as anyone else in a profession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200008#F01800","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380709800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their comments.  I accept the thrust of the amendment as indicated previously.  The regulation is in place to actualise what he is asking for.  The Bill sets out the general licensing principles and the powers for the National Transport Authority to make licensing regulations.  Following the recommendations of the taxi regulation review report, the NTA has already made regulations under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, which provides that the holder of an SPSV licence must be the registered owner of the vehicle concerned and have insurance for that vehicle.  It is a package.  Regulations also provide for full-package rental only so that it is no longer possible, since 1 January, to rent a taxi plate only.  Members on all sides of the House have said that is the right thing to do.  The application of these regulations is preserved under section 67 of the Bill, until such time as the NTA makes revised regulations under the provisions of this Bill following enactment.  Such matters concerning the administration of the licensing system are best dealt with in secondary legislation.<\/p><p>  Therefore, as there is adequate provision in the existing legislation and in the Bill to provide for the regulatory requirement as proposed by the Deputy, I will not make further amendment to the Bill in this regard.

What would give the taxi drivers a greater degree of comfort and assurance is if the Minister of State can spell out how there will be proper enforcement.  I take the point that the Minister of State is providing for this in secondary legislation and that the regulation is in place.  However, the taxi drivers feel there is a long history of failed regulation and that, even now, the situation is unacceptable.  I was talking to a taxi driver yesterday who mentioned the new app that allows people to identify whether a driver is properly registered.  He is a representative for one of the taxi groups and on a regular basis he uses the app and finds three or four people who are not properly registered and licensed in the space of an hour or two on any given day.

Despite the massive amount of regulatory changes that I have imposed after the review and despite this Bill, the most comprehensive taxi Bill ever in this country, without enforcement this work will not achieve what we collectively desire.  That is happening and will be in place.  I have also spoken to the drivers the Deputy refers to.  They will see this directly in their face.  Those who have nothing to worry about will have no issue with this.<\/p><p>  The free app is very successful for anyone who wants to check out taxi drivers and taxis prior to getting in.  The app is almost 100% accurate in respect of data.  Some drivers do not update information quickly enough, which accounts for some of the information referred to.  Quite soon, it will be communicated by the National Transport Authority that it is unacceptable for a car to be rented out and for someone to be driving and not have updated information.  Drivers have been given adequate notice and the app has been in place for a considerable period of time.  Members of the public can report those who are not registered.

The amendment concerns the Good Friday Agreement and ex-prisoners.  I have made the point many times and have provided the Minister of State with legal advice.

We raised this point in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad time out of number.  I gave the Minister of State a document on this.  The Minister of State keeps telling me he has legal advice that he cannot do that but there is nothing to preclude us from doing it.  The Minister of State talked about spent convictions and how the matter can be raised under that legislation but we do not have to do so.  The measure could be included in a single paragraph in this Bill stating that people are exempt.  I do not have a problem with it if people were convicted after 1988 and were involved in serious crime but there are serious repercussions for many families across this island.  Many ex-republicans and ex-prisoners are involved in the taxi industry.  The Government, the Labour Party and Fine Gael signed up to the Good Friday Agreement and all it entailed.

We have been around the houses on this point, on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and on a few radio stations.  These amendments seek dispensation in the Bill for those convicted of offences covered by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is simply not inappropriate for me to specify such an exclusion in the context of the proposed legislation.  This is a Bill dealing with taxis.  Section 10 of the Bill provides for the consideration of such offences in the assessment of suitability of a licence applicant or licence holder.  Sections 30 and 31 concern mandatory disqualification for conviction for the most serious of offences and an obligation to notify conviction for these offences to the licensing authority.<\/p><p>  The point at issue in the taxi legislation is the safety of passengers who are in a vulnerable position in a taxi.  Nevertheless, because of the restriction this places over the possibility of persons to participate in the industry, the grounds for mandatory disqualification is, for legal reasons, narrowly defined.  It is not possible in legislation to seek to further define instances where there may be mitigating circumstances that justify the non-application of the disqualification.  That is why the Taxi Regulation Bill makes specific provision for an appeal to the courts on mandatory disqualification so that exceptions are possible where the courts determine it is appropriate.  The courts are positioned to make that kind of judgment. <\/p><p>  Under section 30(10), in determining whether to grant or refuse such an application, the court can have regard to any matter that the court considered relevant.

That Bill was initiated in and passed by the Seanad and is now being debated in the D&aacute;il.  As I have stated on previous occasions - the Deputy seems to be replying to a different question - his party did not raise any amendment to the Bill in the Seanad relating to the Good Friday Agreement.  On numerous occasions the Deputy has stated incorrectly and in a manner which I find totally unacceptable that I sat in the Seanad Chamber and replied when the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 was being debated.  He said so recently in a radio interview.  I hold a copy of the transcript of the debate on that date.  I was not present and did not reply.  The Deputy's party did not table any amendment.  It did table amendments to the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 but not to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012.  If the Deputy wants to table amendments, this is the Bill to which he should table them.

I support the comments of previous speakers about bringing in more control.  During race week in Galway I got a taxi from town that had come from Sligo; the driver was going to work in Galway that evening before heading back to Sligo, which is an example of unfair work practices.  I will raise another matter that occurred in Galway a while back, and I had raised it with the Minister of State's predecessor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the taxi regulator.  With this case, a certain individual purchased ten cars and registered them as taxis, complete with plates and licences.  He paid the first instalment of his insurance premium on the ten cars and registered in a house on the east side of Galway city.  The cars and drivers were put on the road for 24 hours a day, and the insurance company tried to contact the individual because after two months he stopped paying his insurance premium.  However, he was no longer at his registered address.  The person is a non-national but I am not being racist.  I was questioned by garda&iacute; when I raised the matter and a complaint was lodged against the person, so I am very familiar with the case.  These cars remained on the road and the insurance certificate was put on the windscreen despite the car not being insured.  In fairness to the taxi regulator, when I raised the matter it tried to cordon off the city to see if the people involved in the operation could be caught.  From what I can gather, that was not possible.<\/p><p>  That is one issue but a young family with a husband, wife and three kids could get into one of those uninsured cars.  What would happen if there was an accident?  Perhaps something should be tightened up or controls could be put in place.  Maybe there are provisions in that area in the Bill.  We must ensure that the vast majority of people driving taxis are law-abiding citizens.  I know another case of a young lady visiting Galway who did not know the city.  When she got in a taxi to go to an establishment in Oranmore, the taxi driver said he had never heard of it.  A taxi run from Galway city to Oranmore is approximately &euro;10 or &euro;15 but this woman was charged &euro;56.  That is what is going on in certain cases.<\/p><p>  Perhaps if people are abusing the system, the issues could be tidied up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200012#K00400","speaker":"1108"},{"type":"speech","time":1380711000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The Deputy will see that they are if he reads the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200012#K00500","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1380711000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, and in all fairness I should have read the Bill but did not.

They need to be dealt with, although I will not go over our history of lax regulation.  I will not look to make political points or deal with individuals who had to look after regulatory affairs.  It was an absolute mess and this legislation will work hand in glove with regulations that are to be introduced.  I accept the frustration felt by many in the industry and the work cannot be done overnight.  We must work within the law, and as Deputy Dooley mentioned, there are constraints relating to legal issues and European and domestic competition laws etc.  The qualitative changes will incrementally overhaul this industry and enforcement will happen.  I have dedicated two years of my life to ensuring that this industry will be completely cleaned up.  In many ways I would like to have done this differently but one must work within the framework of the laws of the land and adhere to European laws as well.<\/p><p>  The taxi driver working in Galway operating out of Sligo obviously has a licence to operate in Galway and must have passed the local test.  Otherwise he should not have been operating outside Sligo.  The Deputy detailed the issue concerning a gentleman with multiple cars and all the legislation we are putting through here is aimed at dealing with such matters.  There was a famous &quot;Prime Time&quot; report but I knew about that before it was publicised.  I wanted the issue to be in the public eye before we brought through some of the regulations because we wanted the public on-side.<\/p><p>  I will not accept the amendment as outlined but I agree with the spirit of what has been said.  I have stated numerous times in the House, the Seanad and in committee, as well as on national television and radio, that my orientation has always been towards full-time taxi drivers.  I accept that they have been dealt a very tough hand over a number of years because of the volume of taxis, particularly in large urban areas, and there is a need for massive change.  The legislation has gone through much thought and analysis with the Attorney General, and it is going as far as we can.  We do not want to act in a way that could endanger the legislation.<\/p><p>  The proposed amendments seek to exclude persons holding or applying for a taxi licence who are also in other full-time employment from operating in the industry.  I sympathise with full-time taxi drivers in the industry who comply with regulations and find themselves in an increasingly competitive environment, working longer hours with fewer potential fares on the streets than there would be in better economic times.<\/p><p>I get taxis frequently.<\/p><p> However, the restatement of section 11, as amended on Committee stage, sets out the narrow parameters within which the obligation to inform the authority of other occupations can be applied.  This is after going through an extensive filtration process.  The first is an obligation on a licence applicant or holder in the case of all other employment to inform the authority, and, second, in the case of other employment involving driving a vehicle that the person has an added obligation to show to the authority that the employer has been notified.  I am assured by advisory counsel that such a provision would not raise difficulties in terms of constitutional rights or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is entirely reasonable that the Oireachtas can require that an employer, where the other occupation involves driving, be aware of the fact that an employee may be driving a taxi in order that the employer in question can satisfy him or herself that the employee is capable of safely discharging driving activities connected with his or her employment.<\/p><p> I have gone as far as I can in this provision in light of the potential risk of legal challenge concerning a person's constitutional rights.  It is not open to me to consider legislating for a prohibition for persons with another full-time occupation on engaging in the taxi industry on a part-time basis.  The provision of services on a part-time basis is an important factor ensuring an adequate supply of services in some cases.<\/p><p> The amendment would also have a significant detrimental effect on services in rural Ireland.  The Bill applies not only to Dublin and Cork but to the entire country.  There are no full-time taxi drivers where I come from because there is no market for them.  The amendment would seriously affect the part-time drivers who operate in my area and we should not affect them in a detrimental way.

I accept that the Bill is a significant advance on what was an anarchic scenario, which was unfair to full-time taxi drivers and which the Government inherited.  It was more than legal problems that led a previous Government to deregulation.  An ideological bent was pursued, particularly by the Progressive Democrats Party, which Fianna F&aacute;il went along with, where they decided they would just let the market rip.  It was disastrous for taxi drivers.  The lines of taxi drivers, the numbers of taxis, the frustrated drivers sitting on ranks for hours fighting for inadequate rank space unable to make a living and the terrifying spike among drivers all resulted from that ideological pursuit and the economic crash on top of that.  I accept this is a genuine effort by the Minister of State to clean up the industry and regulate it in a way that should improve conditions for taxi drivers.  However, they have good cause to say that where some full-time drivers can barely make a living and part-time drivers who have other full-time work can come in and cherry-pick the good work, something has to be done about that.

For example, the lack of rank space, of which the Minister of State is well aware, means that sometimes taxis have to queue up at the end of ranks and are not quite in the rank but there is nowhere else to go and that could potentially lead to demerits against them.  Other relatively small issues could result in demerits for taxi drivers who are trying to do their job in good faith and drivers could find themselves suspended and have great difficulty in getting their licence back.<\/p><p>  Taxi drivers also expressed concern about car insurance during the period when their PSV licence is suspended for three months.  The amendment seeks to delete a reference to the potential sanction of the suspension of a licence for taxi drivers whether a licence holder has been convicted of an offence relating to the contravention.  It seems problematic if they have not been convicted.  If they have, it is one thing, but it is a problem in the event of no conviction being made.  That seems to suggest punitive action could be taken against taxi drivers for potentially trivial offences that could endanger their ability to make a living and sustain their job.  I would welcome a comment from the Minister on that but I am inclined to press the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200014#M00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1380712200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The provisions of section 12 have been considered in some depth by my Department and by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  The reason for this is that the consequences of such a provision &ndash; to revoke or suspend a licence - affects a person&rsquo;s ability to earn a living.  Therefore the basis upon which such a decision would be taken by a licensing authority must be precise and explicitly provided for in primary legislation.<\/p><p>  It is entirely reasonable that the contraventions that might be the basis for decision under section 12, whether or not there is a conviction for such a contravention, would include contraventions under the provisions of this Act or under regulations made under this Act, or contravention of the terms and conditions of the licence or any code of practice.  Some of these contraventions would carry with them offences, and the licensing authority would also take into consideration if the licence holder had a conviction for such an offence.<\/p><p>  The licensing authority is of course always subject to a duty to exercise its powers in a reasonable manner.  That is absolute: it must exercise its power in such a manner.  There are appeal provisions in place so as to ensure this is the case.  Therefore, I cannot agree to the deletion of text as proposed by the Deputy in amendment No. 4.<\/p><p>  I also cannot agree to amendment No. 5, which seeks to delete the power of a licensing authority to suspend a licence for three months under section 12.  The revocation provision under section 12 is based on a tiered approach.  That gives the licensing authority a degree of discretion to determine that a contravention under the Act, regulations or terms and conditions of a licence, or failure to provide correct and true information could incur a lesser penalty than revocation &ndash; either suspension for three months or a reprimand, warning, caution or advice.  Therefore, section 12 provides for a suite of sanctions that can be applied on a proportionate basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200014#M00700","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1380712200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I accept that I cannot press amendment No. 5 because there are circumstances where suspension is legitimate, justified and necessary.

The measure will not affect them.<\/p><p> Let me make a point to show that we do listen.  The issue raised by the Deputy Dessie Ellis on ranks has been addressed as regards demerits.  I actually listened to the case made and addressed the matter because the point was legitimate.  I have written to local authorities and met local authority representatives across the country.

I have got into cars, particularly in Dublin, and could not understand how the drivers could have licences.  There was a lack of regulation, but the drivers have licences and one cannot exactly take them off them now.  It is virtually impossible as the licences are legally held.  Obviously, through some process involving a lack of regulation, the licenses were obtained.  We need a process for dealing with the drivers in question through this Bill.

One must put in place a regime under which one can take licences off people or suspend them for reasonable reasons in order to clean up the industry.  The Deputy must remember that I inherited the industry.  I must clean it up within the provisions of the laws of the State and the European Union, including competition laws.

Taxi drivers have phoned this supposed charity for the disabled and asked for a taxi to bring a relative to a particular destination.  They have been told there is no problem, that the car will arrive within five minutes.  The firm is charging two thirds of what a normal taxi would charge for the same journey.  That firm is getting Government money to do that, which is an unacceptable abuse that must be dealt with urgently.  Taxi drivers are saying that if firms such as the one I mentioned are getting a subvention to provide services for the disabled and elderly, legitimately, then taxi drivers should also be given a subvention.

It is vitally important that in our efforts to regulate the industry in a fair and consistent manner we do not forget about providing for those with disabilities and ensuring there is adequate provision of suitably adapted vehicles to meet their needs.  That issue was taken into consideration previously when the only licences that were issued were to those drivers who had wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  That was a provision that facilitated individuals in becoming licensed taxi operators.  However, I have certainly seen a reduction in the number of wheelchair accessible vehicles on the road and that has also been reported to me by various disability groups.  Notwithstanding that, it is outrageous that some charitable organisations are misusing legislative provisions to establish a service providing transportation for the disabled, seeking State support to do that and then plying their wares, so to speak, in direct competition with taxis.  However, the provisions of this legislation would, in my view, automatically preclude them for doing that.  It is probably an enforcement issue rather than a legislative one.  That said, it is important to highlight the matter because a number of taxi drivers have raised this issue with me.

I have no problem with charitable organisations and as Deputy Dooley has pointed out, there are provisions in this Bill to deal with the matter raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  However, we cannot wait for the passing of this Bill before dealing with the single isolated issue referred to by the Deputy.  It must be dealt with immediately, if what the Deputy has said is actually the case.  Indeed, I accept the Deputy's bona fides on this.  Many charitable organisations across the country do fantastic work, through the provision of cancer cars, cancer buses and many other forms of transport.  They do brilliant work which is absolutely not for profit.  That work is clearly defined but if a charitable body is advertising in direct competition with taxis, that is a totally different matter and must be dealt with.  I give the Deputy my word that the issue will be investigated.<\/p><p>  The broader issue of catering for those with disabilities is something to which I am absolutely committed.  The Deputies are correct about the fact that the number of WAVs, or wheelchair-accessible vehicles, has dropped.  I cannot tolerate the fact that some people obtain these licences and then use them as a mechanism for bringing the golf boys off to Dublin Airport.  Then, when somebody who genuinely needs a wheelchair accessible taxi tries to order one, he or she cannot get one.  Everyone in the House would condemn that because it is unacceptable.  I am taking a number of actions to deal with this problem.<\/p><p>  I was very impressed by a chap called Stephen Cluskey who set up his own website dealing with access to wheelchair-accessible taxis and have appointed him to the taxi committee.  He is an excellent young man.  I am currently working with the NTA to ensure that there is a single dispatch number for wheelchair-accessible taxis across the entire country.  In that way, those who look for such a taxi will be able to use a single number to identify the wheelchair-accessible taxis that are available in their own area to take them wherever they want to go.

In this regard, there is an issue in regard to wheelchair accessible taxis.  The provision in the regulations is that a vehicle applying for a renewal of a licence may be no more than ten years old.  The difficulty is that in rural Ireland a huge investment is required in the purchase of such vehicles and in having them adapted for wheelchair users.  However, because there are not huge numbers of people using these accessible taxis, it takes far longer to get a return on that expense.<\/p><p>I know it is up to 15 years for existing vehicles, but this will be reduced to ten.  We need more flexibility in dealing with the situation in rural Ireland such that when general regulations are drafted, not only for wheelchair accessible taxis, the regulator will not only consider the implications in the city centre of Dublin, Cork or Galway but also in provincial and rural towns.  There is a feeling among taxi drivers that their voice is not being articulated.  In my county taxi drivers hold a licence covering Roscommon and Galway, but we want wheelchair accessible taxis in Roscommon which is a very large rural county.  It is the same with regard to other issues which arise.  When regulations for the entire country are introduced, the regulator should be conscious of, and take into account, the fact that in some instances what is applicable in Dublin city centre is not necessarily applicable in rural Ireland.  I ask for this to be taken into account and written into the legislation that these issues are weighed.  In other words, regulations to be introduced should be rural proofed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200019#R00700","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380715200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>While I will not accept the amendment, I am in full agreement with the principle behind it, which is concerned with transport needs in rural areas and the transport requirements of rural dwellers.  No other Minister or Minister of State who dealt with the taxi industry kept referring to the fact that we must regulate it for the entire country.  What applies in Dublin does not apply anywhere else, not even in Cork which has its own urban issues, or in Limerick.  Specific issues arise in Dublin.  Completely opposite issues arise in rural Ireland where there is market failure, which is why this legislation contains provision to ensure we will have other forms of licences such as the rural hackney licence, to which I have referred.  The reason I did not accept earlier amendments on part-time drivers is anyone driving in rural Ireland is a part-time driver.  For this reason, I accept the Deputy's bona fides, but the objectives of the NTA in carrying out its functions under section 19 are intended to be fulfilled on a State-wide basis.<\/p><p>  I have the benefit of having spent almost 15 years of my life in urban settings, but being a good rural Tipperary man, I understand thoroughly the issues from a rural perspective.  I assure the Deputy there are sufficient provisions under section 20(2) to allow the authority to make regulatory provisions to meet different circumstances and areas of the State, including specific provision for rural transport, in which I know he has a keen interest.  For example, this provision will allow the NTA to make regulations for any specific SPSV requirement necessary to facilitate the aforementioned rural hackney licence.  Therefore, I cannot see a need to make such additional provisions in the Bill which certainly covers the requirements of the Deputy.  It covers the requirements of rural dwellers and allows flexibility in creating new licences, dealing with the issue of community cars and dealing with voluntary, community and charitable groups which needed to be cleaned up.  I thank the Deputy for his contribution, but I do not believe the amendment is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200020#S00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1380715200,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I sympathise with the thrust of the amendment.

In this context, I wish to raise another issue which points a little in the other direction.  It does not counter what Deputy Denis Naughten stated, with which I agree and support, but there are suggestions, reports and anecdotal evidence that some transport services which benefit from the rural transport scheme use these supports to make incursions into urban areas.  I do not know whether this is true.  I have not seen the hard evidence, but I have heard reports that people operating services and competing with taxis in urban areas benefit from grants under the rural transport scheme.  Will the Minister of State examine this issue and see whether there is evidence that this might be the case, which would obviously be an abuse of the supports and unfair to taxi drivers in urban areas?

I have consistently argued that the United nations and the Security Council must be central to efforts to resolve this crisis and ensure international law and basic human rights are upheld.  Despite the long delay in reaching this stage, I welcome the decisive action the Security Council has now taken on Syria.  Full implementation of Resolution 2118, providing for the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons and full compliance by Syria with its obligations, is now imperative.  Ireland has pledged &euro;200,000 in funding to support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, assisted by the United Nations, in implementing these arrangements.<\/p><p>  The Security Council has also called for the early convening of the Geneva II peace conference, I hope by mid-November.  Syria's conflict can only be resolved politically, not militarily.  Peace can only come through all Syrians engaging in a genuine, representative and inclusive process to agree a new political dispensation in their country.  I also welcome the Security Council's clear call for accountability for what has occurred in Syria.  I have long called for these crimes to be referred to the International Criminal Court which is in place precisely for this purpose.<\/p><p>  Ireland is playing its part in the international effort to meet the massive needs both inside Syria and in the wider region, having contributed almost &euro;11 million to fund relief efforts to date.

Once again, however, the Council has been, as it is has been for so long, ineffective in dealing with this issue.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, the European Union is playing its part in providing humanitarian aid.  After two and a half years of bloody conflict in Syria, more than 100,000 people are dead and 6.5 million are displaced, with over 2 million, or 10% of the Syrian population, now refugees in adjoining countries.

The devastating violence has caused more than 2.1 million refugees to seek protection in neighbouring countries, in addition to the more than 4 million people who have found themselves displaced inside their own country.  With almost 7 million people in urgent need of assistance, an immediate and sustained response from the international community is clearly required.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been unwavering in its support to the international humanitarian response.  To date, we have provided almost &euro;11 million to the relief effort and are one of the world's most generous donors - on a <i>per capita<\/i>   basis - to the response to this crisis.  Through trusted NGO partners here in Ireland, as well as the UN and the Red Cross-Red Crescent movement, we are playing a considerable part in the international effort to meet the massive needs, both inside Syria and in the wider region.<\/p><p>  As I am sure the Deputy agrees, it is imperative that the European Union is to the fore in rallying the international community to help alleviate the severe and unconscionable suffering of those affected by the Syrian crisis.  Notably, the EU has to date mobilised almost &euro;1.8 billion in assistance from both the Commission and member states, making this the largest international contribution since the crisis began.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been consistent in its efforts at EU level to ensure the necessary attention is given by the international community to this crisis.  Ireland has used every opportunity to call for all parties to the conflict to fully respect and be held accountable for violations of international humanitarian law.  Moreover, throughout our EU Presidency in the first half of this year, Ireland repeatedly underlined the gravity of the humanitarian situation, including through discussion at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  Most recently, following discussions on Syria at the recent Gymnich - Informal Meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers - held in Vilnius on 6 and 7 September, the High Representative, Baroness Catherine Ashton, issued a press statement highlighting the need for the EU to reaffirm our commitment to the people of Syria and to support them in every way possible through humanitarian assistance.  Ireland strongly endorses this statement.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to encourage the various UN agencies to maintain the unprecedented mutual co-operation that has been forged over the last two years in response to this crisis.  Furthermore, we will persist in highlighting the vulnerable position of Syria's neighbouring countries which have found themselves severely strained as a result of the large scale influxes of refugees.<\/p><p>  In order to assess the current situation on the ground, I will be travelling to the region in the next week.  With the UN Secretary General announcing a further humanitarian pledging conference for Syria in January 2014, Ireland will renew its already significant efforts at European level and internationally to galvanise support from the international community for an enhanced humanitarian response in Syria and its neighbouring countries, which should be understood as a vital complement to the ongoing attention being given to finding a political solution to this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200024#X00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1380717600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Mr. al-Marzooq is a former Deputy Speaker of Parliament who resigned with other opposition MPs in response to the government's suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in February 2011.  It appears that Mr. al-Marzooq's arrest was in response to a speech he gave at a political rally on 6 September which was deemed critical of the government.  The public prosecution service has ordered Mr. al-Marzooq's detention for 30 days pending an investigation.  If convicted, he could face a jail sentence, with the possibility of his nationality being revoked.<\/p><p>  The arrest of Mr. al-Marzooq is a disappointing setback to the national consensus dialogue process between the government and opposition groups and could further exacerbate existing political tensions in Bahrain.  The Wefaq party has already announced it is suspending its participation in the national dialogue in protest.  It is also a worrying sign of the continued repression of human rights in Bahrain, particularly the right to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.<\/p><p>  The Government has ensured Ireland's concerns on human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities and will continue to do so.

There are cases where persons were convicted and were subsequently released on licence and have been re-incarcerated on the basis that they are in breach of their licence condition.  <\/p><p>  The devolution arrangements agreed in 2010, provide that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland remains responsible for national security matters.  My officials in the British-Irish intergovernmental secretariat in Belfast continue to raise appropriate prisoner cases with their British counterparts.  I have on a number of occasions raised the Government&rsquo;s concerns about a limited number of related licence revocation cases directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  Policing and justice powers were fully devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive in 2010 following an all-party agreement reached at Hillsborough Castle.  This was a positive development for partnership government in Northern Ireland and a boost to the peace process.  Completing the devolution of policing and justice powers to the executive had been a very high priority since 1998, as successive Governments, supported by all sides of this House, recognised that building and strengthening confidence across the community in policing and justice was essential to the success, legitimacy and sustainability of the devolved institutions and to embedding peace. <\/p><p>  In April 2010, David Ford MLA was appointed Minister of Justice and assumed responsibility for policing and criminal justice policy.  Prisons policy forms a central part of the Department of Justice's remit and an executive agency, namely the Northern Ireland Prison Service, implements prison policy in Northern Ireland.  A Prisoner Ombudsman is also appointed by the Minister of Justice for Northern Ireland and operates completely independently of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  The Prisoner Ombudsman and his team investigate complaints from prisoners and visitors to prisoners in Northern Ireland as well as deaths in custody. <\/p><p>  An early priority for the Department of Justice was the commissioning of a major report into prison reform.  In October 2011, Dame Anne Owers made far-reaching recommendations related to prison reform in Northern Ireland.  I understand that steady progress has been made to date in implementing the recommended reforms contained within that report.  I wholeheartedly agree with Minister Ford's analysis that delivery of a reformed justice system has a major part to play in building and protecting a more positive future for Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  I also agree with recent comments he made praising new recruits to the Northern Ireland Prison Service for their commitment to the new prison service.  In looking forward to a better future for the several hundreds of recent recruits, I am sure the House will join me once again in condemning the brutal murder of their colleague, prison officer David Black, last November by dissident terrorists. <\/p><p>  With the devolution of policing and justice, the Government&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to ensure the systems in place are robust and consistent with the principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and the other agreements for which we are co-guarantors.  The Government&rsquo;s position continues to be that the full implementation of all of the recommendations of the Owers report remains the most effective way to ensure conditions within all prisons in Northern Ireland are of an acceptable standard.  I have discussed this with Minister Ford in recent times and we are of one mind on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200027#AA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1380719400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The use of language is important.

They were held for a very long period.  This is not comparing like with like.  We are dealing in these cases with individuals against whom there were convictions, who were released on licence, and part of the licence was that they could be re-arrested in certain circumstances.

Members of every household in the country want clean and safe water when they turn on their taps.  I commend the Minister on his ambition for this country that a uniform and satisfactory clean water supply should be available to all houses and businesses regardless of where one lives.  The Minister will be aware that currently this is definitely not the case.  The disparate quality of water is most marked between urban and rural areas.  In some rural areas of Mayo the water coming through the taps is not only unfit for human consumption but in some cases not fit for personal bathing, nor even to use for washing clothes.  In most cases the contamination is naturally occurring because of the ground conditions in a particular area and in spite of drilling wells and being resourceful in many ways people cannot get a clean water supply.  I have seen red coloration coming through the taps that makes it unsuitable for people to wash their clothes.<\/p><p>  This year the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government allocated &euro;200,000 to Mayo County Council for new group water schemes.  However, to date, notwithstanding the fact that communities in Kilmurry, Downpatrick, Ballycastle, Massbrook, Aghalonteen, Carracastle and Furmoyle, comprising 210 houses in total, have been waiting for years for a new group water scheme, the council has not been in a position to spend one red cent of the allocated funding.  That is not for want of trying on the part of the council and the communities.  The problem is that the estimated cost of each scheme is too high compared to the amount of funding available from the Department.  Because of the relatively small number of houses in these far-flung proposed group water schemes in rural areas, the cost of constructing the schemes per household is higher than in more densely populated areas where there are more households to contribute towards the cost of the scheme.  Under the current funding rules the county council is only entitled to recoup a maximum of &euro;6,500 per house from the Department.  In turn, each household contributes approximately &euro;1,200 towards the cost.<\/p><p>In the case of the six Mayo schemes I have mentioned, it leaves a total funding shortfall of &euro;432,000.  Previously, the shortfall was funded through the CL&Aacute;R scheme, but since 2008-09 when it was abolished, the problem has become very acute, with no movement or progress on the schemes, notwithstanding the fact that local households have actually paid their contributions.  In addition, they paid over &euro;170,000 in consultants' fees to have proposals submitted to the Minister and signed off on.  They cannot recoup the money until the schemes go ahead.  They are out of pocket with nothing to show for it.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that this is a problem the Minister has inherited, but I ask him to intervene and put in place a solution to allow the long-overdue water schemes to proceed.  The communities would have benefited from CL&Aacute;R funding in the past because they were identified as areas of rural disadvantage.  I ask the Minister to increase the departmental contribution for the former CL&Aacute;R-associated disadvantaged areas.  At present, it is the same amount per household nationwide, or a sum up to that maximum.  The people themselves cannot afford to make up the shortfall, nor should they be asked to do so, considering that it is already recognised that they are living in disadvantaged circumstances.  I ask that they be refunded the cost of the consultants' fees for the schemes and not be left out of pocket any longer.<\/p><p> I am aware that Irish Water will have responsibility for implementing the Minister's vision for clean water, but I am also aware that it may take up to five years for all the responsibilities to be transferred fully from the water services departments of local authorities and that an issue arises over public and private group water schemes and their sources.  It is not quite clear who will be responsible.<\/p><p> The rules are in place and it appears that Mayo County Council will not be able to spend its funding.  I ask that the Minister intervene in the practical way in which we have become accustomed to seeing him do his business and provide a solution and hope for the people affected who have been waiting a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200028#BB00900","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380720600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am conscious of the good work done by group water schemes throughout the country and the amount of work that goes into putting them in place.<\/p><p>  Between 2000 and the end of 2012, my Department, under its rural water programme, provided almost &euro;770 million towards the capital cost of improving existing group water schemes and the provision of new group water schemes.  This is evidence and proof of how the group water sector is valued by the State.  I am glad to say this investment is continuing and that this year alone a further &euro;20 million has been notified to local authorities by way of block grant allocations under the rural water programme for group water schemes.  The Deputy's county, Mayo, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of this funding, having been notified of block grant allocations not of &euro;200,000, as said by her, but &euro;3.45 million towards group water schemes.  Nevertheless, I am aware that further work needs to be done and that there is a need for continuing investment in the group water sector towards improvements necessary to allow schemes provide water to required standards.<\/p><p>  There are particular issues in putting in place some new group water schemes where the costs involved call into question their viability.  I am sure the Deputy has mentioned some of these.  At present, grants of up to 85% of the cost, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;6,475 per house, are available towards new group water schemes.<\/p><p>  The National Rural Water Services Committee which has a role in advising me on policy and investment in rural water services has been considering this issue and I am expecting to receive some feedback from it by the end of the year.  I will then give serious consideration to suggestions the committee may make with a view, if possible, to improving the situation in the areas mentioned by the Deputy that were originally funded under the CL&Aacute;R programme.<\/p><p>  CL&Aacute;R funding was part of a targeted investment programme launched in 2001 and aimed at tackling deficits in physical, economic and social infrastructure in depopulated areas.  It was a mechanism of co-funding arranged through Departments, State agencies and local authorities to accelerate investment in the targeted areas.  CL&Aacute;R worked by leveraging co-funding for various measures from Departments, various State agencies and local authorities.  At its height, the programme had an annual allocation of over &euro;20 million.  However, decisions had to be made in the Department of Finance in July 2010.  In the capital expenditure review it was agreed to wind down this portion of the scheme.  In the light of what I have said about the National Rural Water Services Committee examining the matter between now and the end of the year, I will determine what can be done to make additional funding available, if possible, to make up for the CL&Aacute;R funding in the finite number of areas that comprise areas of depopulation, as mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200029#CC00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1380720600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I really liked the Minister's closing remarks.

However, we are now entering a critical phase and it is time for all stakeholders to put their money where their mouths are.  Louth County Council confirmed in early July that the construction of the proposed cross-Border bridge had been put on hold after tenders received from construction companies for the project ran substantially above the allocated budget.  Tenders received ranged from &euro;26 million to &euro;40 million, plus VAT, some &euro;15 million over the allocated funding.  In the meantime, the council pledged an additional &euro;2 million for the project in August.  It accepted the EU funding, but the final financial package remains unsecured.

If the project does not progress, a contingency plan may be put in place that is deliverable and will achieve a full draw-down in the remaining timeframe which ends in December 2015.  We need to act quickly to get the project off the ground and resolve how we are to proceed.<\/p><p>  The extremely disappointing news about the overruns comes only two months after the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to put forward its part of the funding.  The Government's decision in the past few weeks not to provide additional funding is a further blow to the viability of the project.  The bridge over the Newry River at Narrow Water has the support of the Governments of the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The project won approval last year from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Northern Ireland planning authority.  The funding deficit must be tackled and it is vital that the Government take the lead in addressing the issue by meeting the councils involved and creating a new source of funding to make progress on this decades-long project.<\/p><p>The development of the bridge will greatly assist in the growth of tourism, economic regeneration and enhancing social relationships in the respective areas.  The completion of the project after decades of lobbying by the local communities will mark an important symbolic leap forward for North-South relations in the Border region.  I am calling on the Government to revise its disastrous decision not to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to provide additional funding.  The Government must ramp up support for the joint committee between Louth County Council and the Newry and Mourne District Council and co-operate with the Northern Ireland Executive to find a workable solution to secure funding and get the project off the ground.<\/p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il has been a consistent advocate of this project and after so much progress has been made in terms of planning and securing funding from Europe, it would be a tragic decision to scupper matters at this advanced stage.  I exhort the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to convey the very strong feelings and sentiments of the people of the Cooley Peninsula and the Mourne region of south Down on the vital importance of this project to them and to the region.  It is hugely symbolic and the bridge will open up an area of the country that has been severely underdeveloped as far as tourism is concerned.  The potential to create jobs and to get additional spending power into the region is obvious.  The bridge would be a very important leap forward and I exhort the Minister of State to convey those sentiments to the relevant Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200029#CC00600","speaker":"945","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380721200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kirk for the opportunity to address this issue.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is unable to be here as he is in London at a number of tourism promotional events but this is a project the Minister is well aware of and has engaged with significantly over the past year.<\/p><p>  As I am sure all Members of this House will now be well aware, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p><p>  In 2011, Louth County Council in conjunction with its Northern Ireland project partners, East Border Region and Newry and Mourne District Council, decided to submit the Narrow Water Bridge project for INTERREG IVA funding.  Prior to this, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport had indicated that due to budgetary constraints and the need to prioritise road maintenance, it could not provide funding to progress the project by itself.<\/p><p>  The project partners submitted an application for funding of &euro;17.4 million based on a project cost of &euro;18.3 million.  The Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, approved the &euro;17.4 million funding on 24 October 2012.  The SEUPB indicated that given the amount of funding involved, project approval was dependent on financial support from the relevant Northern and Southern authorities.<\/p><p>  After the SEUPB approved the project in principle, it sought confirmation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Northern Department of Finance and Personnel of the required financial support before issuing a letter of offer to the project promoters.  In January this year the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport confirmed its upfront contribution of &euro;3.91 million.  Confirmation of funding was also sought at the same time from the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel.  The project was approved for funding by the Northern Ireland Minister in late May, subject to the letter of offer from SEUPB, including a number of specific conditions.  These conditions included a commitment by Louth County Council that it would have sole responsibility for any cost overruns within the eligible spend time frame and in the event that the project extended beyond that period.  In addition, Louth County Council was also required to meet all the maintenance and associated costs related to the upkeep of the bridge and its service area.<\/p><p>  Pending receipt of project approval, Louth County Council went ahead with seeking tenders from short-listed contractors.  The tender assessment process, which was completed in early July, showed a shortfall of the order of &euro;15 million in the funding, as construction tender prices came in at nearly double the estimated cost.  As mentioned previously, while Louth County Council had indicated to SEUPB that it was willing to meet any funding shortfall, this was on the understanding that any shortfall that did arise would be small.<\/p><p>  On 9 July the council released a statement indicating that the tenders received ranged from &euro;26 million to &euro;40 million plus VAT, which was substantially above the allocated budget for the project, leaving the council with a substantial funding shortfall.  The council also stated that while it would try to see if the shortfall could be filled through any combination of additional funding and cost reductions, the project had been put on hold.  Unfortunately, on the basis of the tender prices received, the cost of the project is well beyond that projected and bridging the shortfall is very difficult.  Furthermore, the increased cost of the project now has significantly reduced the benefit to cost ratio associated with it.<\/p><p>  I understand that the SEUPB has been in discussion with Louth County Council and its project partners regarding the financial viability and deliverability of the scheme.  This is to be expected given the scale of the cost increase.  It is a matter for the SEUPB, taking account of its responsibilities for the allocation of INTERREG IVA funding, to assess the position and satisfy itself as to the deliverability of the project.  As part of this process, SEUPB sought clarifications and additional information from the project partners which it is now assessing.<\/p><p>  No formal proposal has been made by Louth County Council to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on increasing the Department's funding contribution.  Due to budget cutbacks, the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport has had to curtail investment on major new or improvement projects in recent times in order to focus available funds on necessary maintenance and repair work, based on the current estimates.  As the Deputy will be aware, a further reduction of in excess of &euro;100 million in the 2014 budget for regional and local roads is scheduled.  It is from this budget that any additional funds for the Narrow Water Bridge would have to come.  Notwithstanding this, the Minister has indicated that he would be willing to consider helping to make up some of the shortfall but only in the context that there would be significant contributions from all other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive.  As I understand it, to date such a package of funding has not been put together.<\/p><p>  If it does not prove possible to advance this project, there are a number of other transport projects of a cross-Border nature that can be pursued to ensure that this funding is not lost to the island.

It would be a huge loss if this project does not go ahead.  Getting capital spending into that part of the country has been a huge challenge and not much public money has ever been spent in the area.  Given the hugely symbolic importance of the project in the context of North-South relations, it would be catastrophic if it were not to go ahead.<\/p><p>  The other possibility, in the event of it not being possible to put a package together at this point in time, is to make contact with the SEUPB with a view to extending the period during which the &euro;17.4 million in funding is available from the INTERREG IVA fund.  Has the Department determined whether it would be possible to extend the period to allow for a change in economic fortunes to facilitate the approval of the project at some not too distant point in the future?  A number of issues must be considered.  The reality is that if the INTERREG money is not drawn down now for the project, the project is effectively gone for the foreseeable future.  While nobody can look into a crystal ball and predict what will happen in five or ten years time, I greatly fear that the project will be put on the back burner and will not proceed.  Tourism in what has been described as the Killarney of the north, the Cooley mountains and Mourne mountains area, which is a beautiful part of the country, is seriously under-developed primarily because the connection between the two areas is not as it should be.  The bridge would fill that gap and would be of huge economic benefit.

All of us have at some stage been asked for advice or help with regard to medical card applications.  Of course, we are usually only ever asked to help in cases where a card has been refused on grounds of income and a review or appeal is sought on grounds of hardship, in most cases caused by the expense of dealing with an ongoing illness or disability.<\/p><p>  It is important when dealing with such cases that the system is fair and is seen to be fair.  In cases where a refusal to grant a medical card is being reviewed or appealed, the Health Service Executive, HSE, issues a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; decision at the end of its deliberations.  This is fine where a review or appeal has been successful but it is deeply frustrating in the unsuccessful cases where people are left in the dark as to the reasons behind the decision.<\/p><p>  It is not unreasonable for the HSE to provide a basic summary of the reasons behind such decisions.  Such reasons may include insufficient medical evidence, a relatively low level of cost or a myriad of other explanations.  This information could prove crucial in deciding whether or not to proceed to a further appeal.<\/p><p>  The HSE, however, does not seem to share the belief this is a reasonable proposition.  Incredibly, it actively blocks any attempts to disclose the reasons behind its decisions and will only provide them on foot of a freedom of information request.  Surely, such a stance cannot be justified.  One promise we made when we got into government was to bring more transparency to our decision-making process across all State bodies.  Much progress has been made and more will come.  In light of such changes, the attitude taken by the HSE is looking increasing archaic and obstructive.<\/p><p>  I believe there is a culture in the HSE that has to be changed.  There are elements of management within the organisation that do not understand the principle that they are there to serve the public, not to make life difficult for them.  Such a culture was referred to recently by the outgoing Ombudsman who pointed out the contrasting difference in policy between the Department of Social Protection and the HSE whose default position seems to be closed and defensive, often to the great cost of the State and the distress of our citizens.<\/p><p>  On this particular issue, I see no reason for the HSE to continue with its policy of requiring freedom of information requests before releasing information regarding medical card decisions.  If anything, it would streamline the process and help reduce the small number of spurious appeals.  More importantly, it would of course remove much of the frustration and distress for medical applicants.  Also there is the additional difficulty for some families that they may be handling the application for a person who is unable to do so themselves, either through illness, age or disability.  Freedom of information requests in such cases can be difficult if those assisting are not legally the guardians or wards of the person requesting the card.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister give strong consideration to changing these procedures?  I cannot see how any cost would be incurred by such a change.  If anything there could well be savings.  More importantly, we would make our system a little bit more human and easier to navigate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200031#EE00500","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1380721800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Nash for raising this matter.<\/p><p>  Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner, GP, services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means including the income and reasonable expenditure of the applicant, his or her partner and dependants.<\/p><p>  Medical card and GP visit card eligibility is subject to periodic assessment review by the HSE to determine a person's continuing eligibility to be approved for a medical card or GP visit card under the general medical services scheme.  This can either be on the basis of a self-assessment completed by the card holder or a full review assessment conducted by the HSE.<\/p><p>  In the former case, the card holder is simply asked to declare whether his or her circumstances have changed to an extent likely to affect their continuing eligibility to be approved for a medical card.  A person who answers &quot;No&quot; to this question on the returned review form will have eligibility renewed for a further period.  A person who answers &quot;Yes&quot; is required to provide the details of current circumstances relevant to conduct a full assessment of eligibility.<\/p><p>  In cases where a full review of eligibility is undertaken, the review proceeds with an assessment of household means to determine if the applicant is within the income limits to qualify for a medical card or GP visit card.  If a review application is assessed to be ineligible on the basis of means for both a medical card and GP visit card or means assessed eligible for a GP visit card only, and the application also includes other medical, social or financial details that do not form part of the means assessment, the application will then be considered on discretionary grounds for a grant of a card under the undue hardship-undue burden provisions of the medical card scheme of assessment.<\/p><p>  Having completed a full assessment of a review application, a letter issues to the applicant advising of the decision on the application.  If a review application is assessed ineligible or eligible for a GP visit card only, the letter issuing informing the applicant of this decision will include an explanation of how the application was assessed and the details of the means assessment calculated on the application.  In addition, the letter will notify the applicant of the details should he or she wish to appeal the decision or provide additional relevant information for a further review assessment.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above practices adopted by the HSE in informing an applicant on the outcome of the assessment of the review application and how this decision was concluded, an applicant can appeal this decision or exercise the right under section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act to be provided with a statement as to the reasons for decisions or actions that causes the withholding of a medical card or GP visit card eligibility to the individual concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200031#EE00600","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1380721800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I appreciate the time the Minister has taken to address this issue in the Chamber.  I am familiar, as every Member and public representative is, with the processes involved in appealing a medical card decision.  A situation I encountered recently with a constituent has shone a light on some of the inadequacies of this process.  The Department of Social Protection deals efficiently with providing details of why a welfare payment has been refused.  The HSE and the Department of Health need to be informed by this approach.  It is beyond me as to why, in this day and age, a citizen would need to institute a freedom of information request as to why he or she was refused a medical card.  I do not believe it is fair or humane.  It is not a practice over which we can continue to stand.  It is important that this issue is addressed in terms of transparency, openness and fairness.<\/p><p>  It is bizarre the HSE has not learned lessons from the past.  While I accept it is improving in many respects, along with interacting with the public, it still needs to be understanding of personal circumstances and provide basic information to applicants who have been refused a medical card.

Towards the end of his second contribution he distinguished between a decision on the basis of income, where the income categories are relatively straightforward and ascertainable and the person either satisfies the requirements or does not, and a discretionary decision.  Where the discretionary aspect comes in, a decision is made on the basis of the HSE's additional jurisdiction to extend a medical card even in circumstances in which the person does not satisfy the income limits.  When the HSE responds, it also indicates how the decision was concluded.  That does not satisfy the Deputy in terms of what information should be given to the applicant on why he or she was refused.  The applicant is told that he or she was refused but not why.  I will undertake to examine that question.

One in ten primary school children and one in six secondary school children miss more than 20 days of school every year, one eighth of the secondary school year.  Last year, almost 1,500 children left school and were not recorded as turning up in secondary school.  We have a severe problem that is building serious social issues for the future.<\/p><p>  A number of years ago Deputy Bruton proposed that children be paid to remain in school.  We cannot afford to do that in the current economic circumstances, but we cannot afford to do nothing either.  I propose the abolition of child benefit for school-age children and its replacement with a school attendance payment.  This would take account of children who are ill or home-schooled, and would be paid in the same manner and at the same rate as child benefit.  Not only would this keep children in school; it would also save the Exchequer between &euro;100 million and &euro;135 million annually.  The administration system is already in place and I seek some joined-up thinking in the interest of children, families and the taxpayer.  Annually, the control division of the Department of Social Protection brings in savings of between &euro;75 million and &euro;85 million under the child benefit scheme.  In addition, &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million is sought from overpayments annually.  Introducing such a payment system would also have a significant impact on child benefit fraud and over-claims, saving the taxpayer &euro;10.5 million to &euro;36 million per year.<\/p><p>  To date the Department of Social Protection has opposed such a move on the basis that it would be illegal under EU law, as this would mean child benefit would no longer be paid to parents living in Ireland whose children reside in another EU country.  However, this proposal would be a fraud prevention measure while also helping to address truancy and cutting down on bureaucracy, rather than focusing solely on stopping the &euro;13.2 million that is paid annually in respect of children who live elsewhere in Europe.  As a result, this would not only address the issues under EU law, but would also meet some of the criteria laid down by the European Central Bank and Ireland's EU targets for reducing red tape and streamlining government.<\/p><p>  Disappointingly, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and her Department have failed even to put such a proposal forward at EU level.  Disappointingly, the Department continues to issue 600,000 letters a year, enough to wallpaper Croke Park Stadium two and a half times, to try to save this money when a simple system could not only save the money but also ensure that children attend school.  It is time we started to do things differently in Ireland and act in the interests of people by joining up government.  We cannot continue to do things as we did them in the past, especially when it takes money out of the pockets of families.<\/p><p>  Finally, I give the example of Jenny, who is six years of age.  In December, her school principal contacted the National Education Welfare Board to say she had been absent for 65 days.  The education welfare officer contacted the family, called to them, wrote to them and issued legal threats, and eventually the family ended up in court.  The mother was fined &euro;200 and the father &euro;300.  Since they went to court Jenny has attended school, but it should not have cost the taxpayer nearly &euro;24,000 and Jenny a year of school before action was taken to bring that about.  This initiative can work; it can ensure that young people attend school and save the taxpayer money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200032#FF00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1380722400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, who is before the Oireachtas Joint Sub-Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  I thank Deputy Naughten for raising the issue of child benefit and school attendance.  Both child income support and school attendance are important social policy concerns of the Government.<\/p><p>  Child benefit is a universal monthly payment that assists all families with the costs associated with raising children up to the age of 18 years and is especially important during a time of recession and unemployment.  Child benefit is paid to approximately 606,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children, with an estimated expenditure of approximately &euro;1.9 billion.  The Deputy should note that child benefit is classified as a family benefit under EU regulations.  A key principle of the regulations is that persons moving to different member states are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same benefits as the nationals of those member states.  Therefore, EU nationals who come to work in Ireland and who pay Irish social insurance contributions are entitled to receive child benefit in respect of their children, even if the children reside in another EU member state.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection takes a proactive approach to ensuring child benefit is paid only to eligible families.  It commenced issuing continuing eligibility certificates to parents in 2008 and has since devised enhanced and updated control measures.  The total savings from child benefit control activity were &euro;48.5 million in 2008, &euro;89 million in 2009, &euro;106 million in 2010, &euro;85 million in 2011 and &euro;83 million in 2012.  The savings achieved so far in 2013 amount to just under &euro;54 million.<\/p><p>  School attendance is a statutory requirement for children up to the age of 16 years.  The National Educational Welfare Board promotes and monitors school attendance up to the statutory school leaving age.  Linking child benefit to school attendance is superfluous, as it is already a statutory requirement.  The continuation of child benefit for children over 16 years and less than 18 years is dependent on children attending school for these two years.  The Department of Social Protection issues a confirmation letter to parents with children aged 16 and 17, which must be signed by their school for each of these years.  The requirement for school attendance for children in receipt of child benefit is already a strong feature of both education and social protection policy.  In the absence of any evidence that the existing statutory arrangements are inadequate, a further measure to link child benefit and school attendance would be an unnecessary duplication and lead to significant administrative costs for schools and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200032#FF00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1380722400,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

Children are not attending school today.  One in six secondary school children misses more than 20 days of school, while one in ten primary school children misses more than 20 days of school.  This has a huge impact on their young lives and leads to significant social consequences down the road.  The Department of Social Protection is abdicating its responsibility because these children are not attending school.  Why are we continuing to pay child benefit to them?

I will stick to the response the Minister has given on the substantive issue raised by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200033#GG00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1380723000,"counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200033#GG00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1380723000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 10 in the name of Deputy Dessie Ellis has already been discussed with amendment No. 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200033#GG00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1380723000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 10:<blockquote>  In page 35, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:&#8220;(<i>d<\/i>) excluding offences covered by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200033#GG00500","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"vote","time":1380723000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 22; N\u00edl, 91.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Dessie Ellis and Sandra McLellan; N\u00edl, Deputies Joe Carey and John Lyons.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200033#GG00600","aye":["1032","1083","1037","1015","1022","1047","1084","1050","960","1049","998","1008","1017","981","969","984","1005","1001","953","1102","1080","956"],"nay":["974","1020","946","1079","989","1029","1030","1071","975","988","1057","972","1041","1099","1006","1101","986","994","1046","968","1107","1007","976","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1105","1009","1068","1055","1051","995","1089","949","967","973","1033","1012","1179","1088","1021","945","1040","1110","1023","996","999","1180","1000","1090","993","965","997","1082","1038","1183","1026","1004","987","1070","985","1034","1067","1177","1056","1181","1044","1018","1059","1060","1058","1061","1081","964","1035","947","952","1074","1013","979","1178","970","978","1065","1095","950","1185","1024"]},{"type":"speech","time":1380723600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 11 arises out of committee proceedings and has already been discussed with Amendment No. 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200034#HH00050","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1380723600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<blockquote>In page 36, line 2, after &quot;offence&quot; to insert &quot;not covered by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement 1998&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200034#HH00100","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"vote","time":1380723600,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 22; N\u00edl, 94.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Dessie Ellis and Sandra McLellan; N\u00edl, Deputies Joe Carey and John Lyons.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200034#HH00200","aye":["1032","1083","1037","1015","1022","1047","1084","1050","960","1049","998","1008","1017","981","969","984","1005","1001","953","1102","1080","956"],"nay":["974","1020","946","1079","989","1029","1030","1071","975","988","1057","1031","972","1041","1099","1006","1101","986","994","1046","968","1107","1007","976","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1105","1009","1068","1055","1100","1108","1051","995","1089","949","967","973","1033","1012","1179","1088","1021","945","1040","1110","990","1023","996","999","1180","1000","1090","993","965","997","1082","1038","992","1183","1026","1004","987","1070","985","1034","1067","1177","1056","1181","1044","1018","1059","1060","1058","1061","1081","964","952","1074","1013","979","1178","970","978","1065","1095","950","1185","1024"]},{"type":"speech","time":1380723900,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<blockquote>In page 37, line 11, after &#8220;subsection&#8221; to insert &#8220;which is not covered by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement 1998&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200035#JJ00050","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1380723900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 12 was discussed with amendment No. 2.

These amendments, in my view, do not improve on the current provision in the Bill, which is a restatement of the statute under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  A broad balance is required on this committee.  It is a fine committee, to which, as I stated in a previous contribution, I have added a person to represent those with disabilities.  From time to time I have heard commentary from various different representative groups and from Deputy Ellis that not enough single licence holders are on this committee.  In order to ensure that this issue is dealt with, there are a number of persons on the committee who are representatives of the taxi sector - as opposed to other groups such as the Competition Authority and the Road Safety Authority - and who are directly involved in the sector.  They are Mr. Gerard Macken from the Taxi Alliance of Ireland, who is a single licence holder; Mr. John Ussher, who has been involved in the sector for a long time and is a single licence holder; Mr. Jerry Brennan from the National Irish Taxi Association, formerly the general secretary of SIPTU's taxi branch and a former single licence holder; Mr. Kevin Finn, a single licence holder from Kerry; and Mr. Derek McGovern, representing the Taxi Company Owners' Association, who is the only multiple licence holder.  Those are the facts.  At that rate, 20% of the representatives are multiple licence holders.  In addition, there is Mr. Martin Plummer, a representative of the National Chauffeur Drive Association, which represents the limousine sector.  Eighty per cent of those on the advisory committee who are there to represent the industry directly do not come from the multiple licence holder sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200038#MM00900","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1380724800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>There are 18 persons on the advisory committee, four of whom represent the taxi drivers.

In line with the Programme for Government commitment, the primary purpose of the Bill is threefold - it will restore the substance of the access to information regime put in place in the 1997 Act; it will extend freedom of information, FOI, to all public bodies, including some noteworthy long\u00adstanding exclusions, while providing the power to extend freedom of information to non-statutory bodies significantly funded from the Exchequer; and it will enhance our FOI legislation so that it works more effectively and is strongly consistent with the objectives for FOI set out in the initial 1997 legislation.<\/p><p>  The Freedom of Information Bill 2013 is of course just one of a broad suite of political and legislative reforms which the Government has advanced.  The reform of FOI legislation is central to the Government's goal of rebuilding public trust in the State and to enhance public governance through a significant strengthening of openness, transparency and accountability of government and public administration.  It is worth recalling the critical role played by FOI since the enactment of the Freedom of Information Bill in 1997 in improving the quality of public governance.  At that time government and public administration was steeped in a culture of secrecy reflecting the legal position under the Official Secrets Act that all official information was a secret and could not be disclosed unless its release was authorised.  The introduction of FOI for the first time lifted this veil of secrecy, allowing light to shine on the conduct of government and administrative affairs and for information relating to the governing of the State to be made available to the public.<\/p><p>  Over the years it is incontrovertible that FOI has made a major contribution in ensuring that public and political debate is better informed by the availability of official information relating to that issue under FOI.<\/p><p>FOI has underpinned a much more open and transparent approach to public administration overall, has been instrumental in bringing issues of vital public concern into the public domain and has facilitated stronger oversight of the actions of government and the public service.  In a number of notable instances FOI has been put to good effect, mainly by the media, to unearth cases of maladministration and-or weak governance.  I refer to the work of my former ministerial colleague, Eithne FitzGerald, who piloted the ground-breaking Act in 1997.<\/p><p> The key principle underlying the that Act, reflected in the Long Title of the Bill, is to enable members of the public to obtain access to official information to the greatest possible extent.  Six years later in 2003 the then Government introduced substantive restrictions in access to information provided under the legislation, which represented a significant curtailment of the principle that the public has a &quot;right to know&quot;.  The assessment of the first Information Commissioner at the time, the late Kevin Murphy, who was a former distinguished civil servant, was that the Government had stepped back from the ideal of more open government.  While falling short of repealing the 1997 Act, the amendments made in 2003 sought as much as possible to turn the clock back to the pre-FOI era by significantly shifting the balance against disclosure of official information.<\/p><p> The changes made in 2003, in addition to the specific restrictions introduced, sent out a powerful message to the administrative system that the Government wished to restore a significantly more opaque model of public governance where the public's right to know was circumscribed.  The starting point for the reforms included in this Bill is essentially to reverse the 2003 changes to ensure Ireland's FOI regime is restored to the top tier of legal frameworks internationally for ensuring access to official information.  In addition, through a number of important innovations included in the legislation, the Bill seeks to provide further impetus to the cultural shift towards more open government that the original legislation was intended to support.<\/p><p> The Bill also provides for the extension of the remit of the Information Commissioner to all public bodies, with some exemptions.  The Bill introduces a generic definition, which will allow the Act to apply to all public bodies subject to strictly limited exemptions.  This follows the approach taken in extending the remit of the Ombudsman, which I brought through the House last year.  It replaces the cumbersome and inefficient approach used in the past of bringing bodies under remit by way of order from time to time.  The principle is every body is in unless it is specifically excluded. Some 480 bodies come under the FOI Act and this extension will automatically increase that number by 100 bodies.  Exemptions are proposed in the public interest for some bodies so as not to affect their ability to perform their core functions or in the interests of the security or financial position of the State.  These include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Treasury Management Agency group, the Central Bank of Ireland, the industrial relations bodies and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  I adopted the policy, in overall terms, of providing for the exemptions from FOI for public bodies in whole or in part in a Schedule to the Bill, other than where the restriction was not expected to change for various public policy reasons.  Inclusion of exemptions for specific public bodies in the Schedule is intended to facilitate scope for their removal or amendment if that decision was to be taken following review in the future.<\/p><p> It is important to stress that the original FOI Act clearly envisaged, consistent with international best practice FOI standards, that there would necessarily be constraints on the application of FOI to particular types of public bodies or to certain activities of specific public bodies in the public interest.  Current policy is that commercial semi-State bodies with some exceptions are not subject to the FOI Acts.  With the exception of Irish Rail, it is proposed that no new commercial State bodies will be brought within remit at this time other than where they provide services on behalf of public bodies.  This is on account of the potential for negative commercial effects that could impact adversely on their competitive standing and commercial performance and to safeguard the State's economic and financial interests, a matter we discussed during the pre-legislative stage at committee.<\/p><p> The legislation also provides a power to extend the Act to bodies significantly funded by the Exchequer by way of ministerial order and my officials will consult relevant Departments regarding governing criteria to assess which bodies should be brought under the FOI Acts.  In moving forward in this area, it will be a priority to balance the public interest with appropriate proportionality.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the extensive reform of FOI proposed in this Bill and the wide extension in the scope of FOI to public bodies, the proposed retention of the &euro;15 application fee for non-personal FOI requests has been a source of debate since the Bill was published.  We also discussed this matter during the pre-legislative stage and I have given it a great deal of consideration.  In assessing this issue, which the House will have the opportunity to debate in detail on Committee Stage, it is important to bear to mind that the application fee is not charged for the majority of FOI requests and, in any event, the application fee is only a small proportion of the estimated average total cost of dealing with a FOI request.  The contention, which I have heard repeatedly, that Ireland is almost unique internationally in levying FOI fees is not correct.  The practice of charging fees for searching, preparing and communicating the response to FOI requests is widely accepted internationally.  However, the position in Ireland is that the charging of search and retrieval fees for FOI requests has in practice become the exception rather than the rule.  Only &euro;7.50 was paid in search and retrieval fees on average in 2011 from a total of 3,857 non-personal requests, which works out at considerably less than 25 minutes of search and retrieval time overall.<\/p><p> In addition to removing the restrictions, extending the Act and restructuring it to make it more accessible to the public, I want to introduce a number of important innovations to update, modernise and enhance our FOI legislation.  For example, the Bill requires public bodies to prepare and furnish &quot;publication schemes&quot; consistent with international best practice in this area to promote the proactive publication of information outside of FOI.  It sets out key statutory principles to guide public bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act including the need to achieve greater openness and to strengthen the accountability of public bodies.  The legislation also provides an important provision to confirm that there is a general right of access to records held by public bodies and, in applying exemptions, the right of access should only be set aside where the exemptions clearly support a refusal of access.  In the interests of minimising costs to requesters and to avoid administrative duplication, the Bill provides for a specific linkage to other access regimes such as the EU-based regulations on the reuse of public sector information and on access  to  information on the environment and there is also a provision which sets out the responsibilities of public bodies in dealing with records relating to data held electronically.<\/p><p>  The changes I am introducing provide the quality of the legislation but its effectiveness will depend on how it is implemented in practice.  Consequently in May last, I initiated a short, focused and targeted operational review of FOI with the objective of establishing a code of best FOI practice for public bodies. This emerged from the many advices we received from FOI Act users where they felt various public bodies treated requests differently.  Some were open while others were less open.  It is important to establish a common code of practice.  The review was carried out by an external group comprising academics, journalists and other users and a public bodies review group consisting of FOI experts in the public service.  Following Government approval, I proposes to publish the draft code shortly for public consultation, before finalising the code prior to or on enactment of the legislation.  Implementation of the code will enhance the overall efficiency of Ireland's FOI regime and secure a sustained improvement in the performance by public bodies of their responsibilities under the FOI Acts.<\/p><p>I thank the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for its scrutiny of the Bill.  Deputy Sean Fleming who is a member of the committee is present.  Its recommendations have informed both the Bill and the code of practice as it develops.<\/p><p> I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains sections 1 to 5, inclusive, and deals with preliminary and general matters, including the Short Title, definitions used, commencement provisions and the power of the Minister to make regulations.<\/p><p> Part 2 which contains sections 6 and 7 is entitled &quot;FOI bodies&quot; - a new term we have coined to encompass both what we traditionally understand as public bodies and also to include significantly funded bodies prescribed under the Act.  Section 6 enables FOI to apply to all public bodies, unless specifically exempt, while section 7 enables bodies funded from the Exchequer to be brought within the remit of the Act, either in whole or in part.<\/p><p> Part 3 contains sections 8 to 27, inclusive, relating to central elements of the legal framework encompassing general rights in relation to records and decisions, to rights of access under FOI to reviews of decisions and ultimately appeals to the High Court.  Section 8 deals with the publication of information on FOI bodies.  Sections 9 and 10 provide for the amendment of records relating to personal information and the right of a person to information on an act of an FOI body affecting that person.<\/p><p> Section 11 sets out details on rights of access to records from FOI bodies.  It contains some amendments which I have mentioned, including the provision of key principles to guide FOI bodies in the performance of their functions under the new legislation.  It also repeals a provision in the 2003 Act which limited the potential for access to records relating to services provided under a contract for services to a public body by a commercial State body or some private bodies.<\/p><p> Section 12 deals with requests for access to records and contains a new subsection enabling requesters to be advised of other regimes for access to official information, thus potentially reducing costs for the requester.  Section 13 deals with decisions on requests and notification of such decisions.  Section 14 relates to the extension of time for consideration of FOI requests.<\/p><p> Section 15 provides for a refusal of an FOI request on administrative grounds, while section 16 permits deferral of access to a narrow range of records.  Section 17 covers the manner of access to records.  It requires FOI bodies to take reasonable steps to search for and extract electronic data from databases.  It also clarifies that where records are available in electronic form, they may be released in electronic and searchable format.  Section 18 relates to access of parts of records.  Section 19 provides that failure by an FOI body to reply to a request within the timeframe specified will be deemed to be a refusal.  <\/p><p> Section 20 provides for delegation of functions relating to FOI to enable more effective operation of the FOI system.  Section 21 provides for internal reviews against an initial decision by an FOI body, while section 22 provides for reviews by the Information Commissioner of decisions of an FOI body.  A number of technical changes are being proposed to the section to improve the functioning of the Act.  Section 23 allows the Information Commissioner to require an FOI body to provide more detailed reasons for a refusal to grant a request.  <\/p><p> Section 24 provides for appeals to the High Court.  Some amendments have been made, including broadening the grounds for an appeal.  Sections 25 and 26 set out precautions against the disclosure of exempt information and a stay on certain decisions which may be subject to appeal.<\/p><p> Section 27 relates to fees.  It was agreed by the Government that there should be a reduction from &euro;75 to &euro;30 in the fee for internal review and from &euro;150 to &euro;75 in the fee for an appeal to the Information Commissioner.  These changes will be effected by way of order following the enactment of the Bill.  Any legislative change needed for a reform of the search and retrieval fees regime which does not operate properly or on a consistent basis across FOI bodies will be introduced on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Part 4 contains sections 28 to 41, inclusive, which provide for a series of exemptions to protect sensitive information.  In section 28 the protection of records relating to meetings of the Government is restored, reversing the restrictions made in 2003.  Section 29 relates to deliberations of FOI bodies, an exemption which had been strengthened in the 2003 Act.  Again, this section has been restored to what it was in the original 1997 Act.<\/p><p> Sections 30 to 32, inclusive, largely re-enact the current sections 21 to 23, inclusive.  Section 33 relates to security, defence and international relations.  In overall terms, the absolute exemption for records relating to the tactics, strategy or operations of the Defence Forces and certain diplomatic communications is removed and made subject to a harm test.  The mandatory exemption remains only for highly sensitive confidential communications relating to, for example, negotiations between the State and international organisations and for information on intelligence in respect of the security or defence of the State.  Section 34 outlines the procedures in relation to the issue of ministerial certificates declaring a record to be an exempt record by reference to sections 32 and 33.  <\/p><p> Sections 35 to 37, inclusive, retain the original exemptions in the 1997 Act for confidential information, commercially sensitive information and personal information held by an FOI body against third party access.  Section 38 outlines consultation procedures to be followed if a head proposes to release, in the public interest, information referred to in sections 35, 36 or 37.  <\/p><p> Section 39 maintains the original exemption for information on research and natural resources subject to certain conditions.  Section 40 protects information where its disclosure could reasonably be expected to have serious adverse effects on the financial interests of the State or the ability of the Government to manage the economy.  Section 41 upholds the operation of specific secrecy and non-disclosure provisions in other enactments, unless such provisions are listed in Schedule 3, in which case they are subordinate to FOI.  Non-disclosure provisions in other statutes not included in Schedule 3 are being reviewed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> Part 5 is a new Part containing section 42.  Section 42 includes a relatively limited number of public bodies where under the original Act the application of FOI was restricted to administrative records.  There are some additions to this section, including certain highly sensitive crime, security and intelligence activities carried out by, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which are excluded from the scope of FOI.  The section also excludes records held by the Central Bank of Ireland which are subject to professional secrecy obligations under EU law which cannot be overridden by national law.<\/p><p> Part 6 contains sections 43 to 47, inclusive, relating to the Information Commissioner in terms of his or her powers and reviews.  Some new provisions are included in section 45 such as to allow the Information Commissioner to apply for a court order to oblige an FOI body to comply with a binding decision of the Information Commissioner where the FOI body has failed to do so.<\/p><p> Part 7 contains sections 48 to 55, inclusive.  Section 48 is a new section providing the Minister with the power to draw up and publish a code of practice and guidelines to assist FOI bodies in the implementation of the Act.  Public bodies shall have regard to the code and guidelines in the performance of their functions.  This is an important new innovation.<\/p><p> Section 50 is a new section which amends the Central Bank Act 1942 to allow the bank to furnish information to the Information Commissioner in the performance of his or her functions.  Section 52 is a new section which provides that it will be an offence under the Act to wilfully and without lawful excuse either destroy or alter a record that is the subject of an FOI request and sets a class B fine on summary conviction.<\/p><p> Section 54 is a saver provision.  Regulations made under the 1997 Act relating to the scope of the application of FOI legislation to particular public bodies, other than those listed in Schedule 5, will cease to be in operation on the commencement of this Bill.<\/p><p> Section 55 is another new section providing for transitional arrangements for actions commenced but not completed under the existing legislation.  For example, if legal proceedings are pending to which the Information Commissioner is a party, the proceedings may continue as if the 1997 Act had not been repealed.<\/p><p>Part 1 of Schedule 1 includes details of the bodies included in part under FOI, while Part 2 includes a list of bodies exempt from FOI in full.<\/p><p> Schedules 2 and 3 re-enact current Schedules but have been updated.  Schedule 4 details the repeals of both primary and secondary legislation effected under the Bill, while Schedule 5 lists the statutory instruments made under the 1997 Act that are to continue in force following enactment of this legislation, notwithstanding the repeal of the 1997 Act.<\/p><p> I trust Deputies will support the Bill.  From our pre-legislative scrutiny, I know there is a positive welcome for the measures taken.  There are issues we will discuss, both on Second Stage and, more formally and in more detail, on Committee Stage to help to strengthen further the governance of institutions and significantly expand the role and remit of the Information Commissioner. <\/p><p> I apologise as I must leave.  I did not actually expect to be here to introduce the Bill.  I have another commitment that I must honour.  I will read with care all of the contributions made by Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200040#OO00900","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380727200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I have quite a number of observations and will ask the Minister to read specifically what I have to say.  I will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  The Minister has published new legislation on what he calls the restoration and extension of freedom of information.  He has made a number of claims about the benefits of the new legislation.  Legislation on freedom of information needs to be updated regularly and in this regard, the initiative of the Minister is welcome.  There are a number of important changes to the legislation, but there are some clear omissions from the Minister's proposals.  I will deal with the latter at length.<\/p><p>  In July 2012 I proposed during Private Members' time the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2012.  It included provisions to extend the scope of freedom of information legislation to the administrative functions of the Central Bank of Ireland, NAMA, the NTMA, the administrative functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health and Safety Authority, the Property Registration Authority, the Road Safety Authority and educational committees.  In my legislation I proposed a cap on search and retrieval fees.  I was very pleased last July when the Minister agreed to allow a Second Stage reading of the legislation.  I am very pleased that he accepted the principle of what I was saying through the legislation.  Quite a few of those principles are incorporated in the Bill before us.  My legislation will now lapse because we are dealing with that of the Minister, but much of what I said is included in his.<\/p><p>  On 6 July 2012 the Minister tabled an amendment to the motion for the Second Reading stating: <blockquote>noting the intention of the Government, as committed in the programme for Government:-- to legislate to restore freedom of information;<\/blockquote>Those were the Minister's words last year.  He has referred to restoring freedom of information for quite some time in the House.  He has done so on several occasions today and almost on every occasion on which he has spoken on freedom of information in the past 12 months.  His statement on restoring freedom of information is extraordinary.  One would almost believe there has been no freedom of information in Ireland for the past decade considering that the Minister stands up time and again to say he wants to restore freedom of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200043#RR00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1380727200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The Deputy's party did a lot of damage to it when it was in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200043#RR00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1380727200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>We will come to that issue and debate it.  I listened carefully to what the Minister said and I am responding to it.  It is clear that nobody told the public that freedom of information was abolished and that nobody told the Information Commissioner.  The Minister considers he has to restore freedom of information.  In that context, let me refer to the annual report for 2011 of the Information Commissioner.  I do not know whether the report for 2012 has been published yet.  It is stated on page 3 of the 2011 report, \"Some 16,517 requests were made to public bodies under the FOI Act in 2011\".  Obviously, the 16,517 people were not aware that freedom of information had been abolished and that the Minister considered there was a need to restore it.  I challenge the spin in the Minister's statement that he is restoring freedom of information.  Of the requests made, 12,581 were for personal information, while 3,857 were for non-personal information.  A small number of requests, 79, were for mixed information.  It is clear that two thirds of all requests under freedom of information legislation were for personal information.  There has never been a charge for personal information, either before or since the amendments in 2003 and the Minister does not propose to introduce any charge for obtaining personal information.  Clearly, there was never a change in any respect in regard to access to freedom of information in the overwhelming majority of cases.  We will deal with some of the changes the Minister referred to in particular.  Some 58% of the requests to which I refer were granted in full, 20% were granted in part and 11% were refused.  Approximately 11% were withdrawn or otherwise dealt with.  Clearly, there has been a very healthy use of freedom of information legislation in recent years and since its inception.  I give credit to former Minister Eithne Fitzgerald for what she did many years ago, long before I became a Member.  The legislation was and is good.  I support its principle but believe some of the changes introduced in 2003 have been exaggerated.<\/p><p>  Having referred to the annual report, I take the opportunity to congratulate the Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O'Reilly, on her appointment as European Ombudsman.  As a consequence of her appointment, she will be retiring as Information Commissioner and Ombudsman in Ireland.  I wish to talk about the process of filling the vacancy which is specifically omitted from the legislation.  The process of appointing an Information Commissioner should be dealt with in the legislation.  There is an entire Schedule on the role and responsibilities of the commissioner in the legislation.  Despite this, there is no specific provision on the appointment.  If the Government is serious about political reform and making the D&aacute;il relevant, an Oireachtas committee should interview the prospective candidate.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide which committee.  The prospective appointee should be endorsed, or otherwise, by an Oireachtas committee and, if endorsed, appointed in due course by the Government and the President, as the case may be.  That would be a very important change.  If the Government is serious in saying it does not want to withhold all power from Parliament, it should carry out this very important initiative.  Parliament must have a real role in the appointment of a new Information Commissioner.<\/p><p>  I touched on the question of fees for personal information.  It is important to note that the Minister is continuing to allow in the new legislation the charging of a fee for an application for information.  It is &euro;15 in normal cases and &euro;10, I believe, if one has a medical card.  The Minister also retains the review and appeals fees for non-personal requests but at a lower level.  I accept that there was a lot of criticism of the 2003 Act.  The main criticism concerned the introduction of the fee of &euro;15 for gaining access to non-personal information.  There was never a charge introduced for gaining access to personal information.  The Minister is retaining this arrangement.  The main thing he could do at this stage, if he is sincere about &ldquo;restoring&rdquo; freedom of information &ndash; I do not believe his view on restoration is correct based on the 15,000 people who make requests each year &ndash; is abolish the fee entirely.  I will be proposing amendments to this effect on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  During our discussion at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform many members referred to the cost to organisations of processing the fee.  In many cases, the cost of setting up a computerised system for processing fees pertaining to freedom of information requests is far greater than the income earned from the fees.<\/p><p>Not only is it not right to have a fee in principle, it is also an inefficient method of raising funds.  I ask the Minister to take this into account when we are considering the matter on Committee Stage.  <\/p><p> Section 27, the heading for which is &quot;Fees&quot;, begins thus: &quot;Subject to this section, a fee of such amount as may be appropriate having regard to this section shall be charged by the FOI body concerned and paid by the requester concerned to the body in respect of the grant of an FOI request&quot;.  The Minister has put it in black and white that he is retaining the fees and I ask him to withdraw that provision on Committee Stage.  It is identical to what is contained in the previous legislation and he has done nothing to make a change.  If he were to do so, I would compliment him on improving the legislation.  As I said, reduced fees for those with medical cards is another administrative issue and given that the difference is only &euro;5, it would actually be easier to get rid of the charge altogether.  <\/p><p> I keep emphasising that there never was and I hope the Minister has no intention of introducing a fee for requests for personal information.  That has always been the case and long may it continue.  The majority of cases never attracted a fee under freedom of information legislation.  Having said that, I accept that there was a lot of negative publicity about the legislation to the extent that the number of people making requests for personal information reduced for a couple of years.  Such was the controversy over the introduction of fees for non-personal information that people believed the fees also applied to requests for personal information.  Many held back from making a request when they should not have done so because there was actually no fee chargeable.<\/p><p> I will move on to the issue of search and retrieval fees, to which I specifically referred in the legislation I put forward in the House last year when I proposed that a cap be applied.  There are two comments in the Minister's opening statement which link with this issue and I ask him to consider it further.  When I was preparing the draft legislation last year, I submitted a parliamentary question to every Minister about freedom of information search and retrieval fees in their line Departments and the information I received was quite extraordinary.  I will elaborate on the replies I received for the benefit of those listening to this debate who would not otherwise have this information.  <\/p><p> I asked what was the highest fee charged because I was interested to know how excessive the fees were.  I posed that question because two budgets ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, introduced one taxation measure about which I was very curious, in terms of its origins.  I submitted a freedom of information request to the Department of Finance, seeking the documentation, information and representations that had been made on the particular change.  The reply I received from the freedom of information officer in the Minister's office was that the search and retrieval fees would be &euro;1,257.  That stopped me in my tracks straightaway and I never proceeded with my request.  I was shocked that what I had thought was a simple request could attract such a fee.  It was a scandal.  I did not proceed and believed it was unreal.  That is one of the reasons I followed up on the search and retrieval fees issue with each Department.  <\/p><p> In his parliamentary reply to me last summer the Minister for Finance said the highest search and retrieval fee charged in his Department that year was &euro;83.  Obviously, people like me who submitted requests for information and were given figures of &euro;1,200 or more did not proceed with those requests.  They were effectively withdrawn.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport replied that the highest search and retrieval fee it charged was &euro;41.40.  The highest fee in the case of the Department of Health was &euro;1,676, with the average fee amounting to &euro;261.  At that stage the Department of Children and Youth Affairs had received no FOI requests.  The highest fee at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine was &euro;301, while the figure for the Department of Defence was &euro;523.  The Department of Justice and Equality had charged somebody who obviously had paid the fee because it was listed &euro;15,664 in search and retrieval fees in a particular case.  However, the Department did point out that the average fee was only &euro;130, but there was one particularly high fee charged that year.  The highest fee in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was &euro;3,142, while the highest fee in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was &euro;1,487.  The highest fee in the the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht was &euro;15.70, while the highest fee in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was a mere &euro;8.30.  The highest search and retrieval fee charged by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was &euro;4.81, while the highest fee charged by the Department of Education and Skills was &euro;1,046.  I have already mentioned that the Department of Finance indicated that the highest fee it had charged was &euro;83.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated that the highest search and retrieval fee for that year was &euro;7,961.  The star Department as far as I am concerned is the Department of Social Protection.  It is the absolute star Department and a model for every other Department.  It did not impose search and retrieval fees on anybody seeking information during the course of the year.  <\/p><p> I referred to the Ombudsman's report for 2011.  That report indicated that the Department of Social Protection had received well over 1,000 freedom of information requests.  Obviously, over three quarters or 80% of these requests were for personal information, but there had to be 100 or 200 for non-personal information.  We all know from dealing with the Department by way of parliamentary questions how quick it is to access the information requested.  It can furnish responses to Deputies in no time.  It has everyone's file on computer, no matter which part of the country one is from.  It seems to be a model in how to handle information.  Obviously, search and retrieval fees were not a big issue, even when the Department was asked to provide non-personal information.  A policy decision was made not to charge.  That is the model we should be considering and if one Department can do it, there is no reason others cannot.  The Minister referred to inconsistencies on this issue and I have just highlighted some of them.  All of the information I have imparted is already on the D&aacute;il record by way of replies to parliamentary questions that I asked in February 2012.  <\/p><p> I proposed a maximum search and retrieval fee of &euro;500.  In that context,  I am very intrigued by the information supplied by the Minister.  He said that, on average, &euro;7.50 was paid in search and retrieval fees in 2011, for a total of 3,857 requests for non-personal information.  We are talking about the average fee.  Obviously, the Department of Social Protection is at one end of the spectrum, while the Department of Justice and Equality would be at the other.  The average fee works out at &euro;7.50 and I am very glad that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform provided that information.  I ask him to reconsider the point he made later in his contribution when he said that any legislative change needed for a reform of the search and retrieval fee regime which did not operate properly or in a consistent way across FOI bodies would be introduced on Committee Stage.  I put it to him that the average fee is &euro;7.50.  In that context, I ask him to do the decent thing and not waste Oireachtas time in passing legislation to regulate something that yields &euro;7.50.  I ask him not to belittle the national Parliament by spending time discussing what is a trivial amount of money.  If that is the average fee - the Minister supplied the figures - and that is all that is involved, it is not worth the administrative hassle to try to collect it.  Not only should he move away from charging &euro;15 for the initial application, or &euro;10 for a person with a medical card, he should also move away from charging a search and retrieval fee.  He has said the average fee is &euro;7.50 which is so small that he should forget about it.  He should not waste Oireachtas time on this issue.  I ask him not to write memos, draw up codes of practice or devise regulations aimed at consistency and on how to charge when the amount involved is only &euro;7.50.  It is a trivial amount and it is often said the law should not concern itself with trivial matters.  The sum of &euro;7.50 is not one we should be discussing in the national Parliament.  There is only one way to deal with this issue and that is to abolish the charge entirely.  I am very pleased that the Minister gave the information which I did not have previously.  <\/p><p> The question of search and retrieval fees is not really about money but about the rights of citizens to access information.  I know there are public servants who will say that if the fee is abolished, some citizens will abuse the system and because they believe two or three citizens will abuse the system by asking for reams of information, they will try to put in place an enormous bureaucratic regime in every Department for search and retrieval fees which will only yield, on average, &euro;7.50.  If officials use the legislation correctly, they can deal with vexatious, trivial and repeat requests.  There are several ways for them do deal with such issues, instead of running to the Minister to ask him to draw up a new bureaucratic regime.  I hope common sense will prevail on this issue.  I also hope people will find the information I imparted useful because it complements what the Minister said about different approaches being taken across the various Departments.<\/p><p> There are serious shortcomings in this legislation, particularly around those bodies exempt from freedom of information legislation.  My suggestions will be amendments on Committee Stage which will not just be one sitting.  The most obvious omission from the Bill is the Minister&rsquo;s decision not to include Irish Water in the provisions of freedom of information legislation.  The exemption of this new commercial semi-State organisation which will have an absolute monopoly of the provision of water for households and premises is astonishing.  The Minister has also stated he is not extending freedom of information to any of the existing commercial State bodies, with the exception of Irish Rail, as it is the only rail provider in the State and no competition issues arise.  I understand the logic of not extending freedom of information to Aer Lingus, the ESB and Bus &Eacute;ireann because it could put them at a commercial disadvantage with their competitors.  However, Irish Water is the same as Irish Rail.  Why can it not come under the legislation?  The issue was discussed with the Minister earlier in the summer at the finance committee and he initially stated all new public bodies would come within the remit of the legislation.  However, when he was pressed on the inclusion of Irish Water, he hummed and hawed.  As it has a monopoly in water provision, I do not see how freedom of information requests could reveal commercially sensitive information.<\/p><p> Schedule 1, Part 2 lists the other agencies exempt from the legislation.  While I do not have a problem with some of them, there are others that should not be exempt.  They include EirGrid which is not in competition with any other body as it manages the electricity network.  I am astonished that the Minister would exclude the Food Safety Promotion Board as the public wants to know what the board is doing.  Tourism Ireland is also excluded.  While I accept that the Minister might claim it is in competition with other tourism bodies outside Ireland, its administrative functions, at least, should be included within the remit of the Bill.  Which companies is Waterways Ireland in competition with, as it is also excluded?<\/p><p> It is claimed that this legislation has been extended to cover people working on behalf of public bodies on an agency basis.  Will the receivers and administrators working for the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, be included?  The Oireachtas finance committee recommended that the Office of the President be brought under the legislation.  Bus &Eacute;ireann provides school transport services for the Department of Education and Skills on a contract agency basis.  Will it come under the freedom of information legislation as it is not a commercial matter?<\/p><p> The Information Commissioner highlighted in section 41 that there were 230 secrecy provisions embedded in every Department.  These should all be consolidated into one and not sneaked in by different Ministers here and there without the knowledge of the Information Commissioner who has pointed out that they are included in Schedule 3 which now comes under the heading of freedom of information.  Some Departments will be happy to let some items come in under it.  However, there are still 100 legislative provisions not included in Schedule 3.  The outgoing Ombudsman, Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, made it clear at a recent finance committee meeting that she agreed with the logic in continuing to exclude 48 of these but not the other 52.  For example, the Department of Health has excluded the Dentists Act 1985 and the Nurses Act 1985 dealing with information on fitness to practise inquiries.  The public is entitled to know about this.  The Department has also excluded corporate plans from the Health Act 2004, which is a mistake.  I know the Minister would change his mind on this issue if he were to consider it seriously.<\/p><p> I will be introducing amendments to have legal timescales for the release of information and appeals, make provision for electronic requests, electronic payments and proper training for all staff, particularly in publicly funded organisations such as non-governmental organisations and charities who are not public servants as such.  I also want to see the establishment of a database of all released information in order that it can be accessed without having to make another request.<\/p><p> All statutory instruments provided for in the Bill should be brought back to the Oireachtas to require a positive vote rather than automatic enactment.  Will the Minister produce a list of bodies contemplated under section 11 where public services are contracted out to other bodies and agencies?<\/p><p> In 2003 the former finance Minister, Mr. McCreevy, introduced restrictions on access to Government papers, Cabinet records, as well as records on security matters, international relations, defence issues, Northern Ireland issues and the deliberative process.  How many requests have been covered by this provision since 2003?  Since they were introduced, there have been 150,000 freedom of information requests.  How many came within these restrictions?  I suspect the effect of the restrictions has been grossly over-exaggerated.<\/p><p> The issue of personal information under section 37 needs to be examined.  I know of families who cannot gain access to information on a deceased relative because of the legislation.  I have also dealt with cases in which people filled in an application for a disability pension which was then signed by the doctor.  When they sought a copy of the file, departmental officials told them that the form signed by the doctor could not be released.  This is a provision that needs to be corrected.<\/p><p> There are new restrictions on the release of financial information on NAMA.  I am shocked that the Minister has introduced a provision excluding records &ldquo;advising on or managing public infrastructure projects, including public private partnership arrangements&rdquo;.  It is impossible even for the Committee of Public Accounts to obtain information on these arrangements.<\/p><p>The Minister is playing to the big boys who want to be involved in PPPs and bringing in new restrictions on information on PPPs.  Last year he announced &euro;800 million in PPPs for health centres, but it has not yet happened.  We want to know what is happening with some of these health centres where Ministers are involved.  The provision being introduced to prevent people from getting information on PPPs is a scandal and if the Minister thinks about it, he will have to reverse it.  We want to see that happen.  I want the code of practice, to which the Minister has said staff shall have regard, to be mandatory.<\/p><p> On page 73 there is an item which I am shocked the Minister has included in the legislation.  I have said this several times.  Regarding the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, as part of the Haddington Road agreement, the Minister's Department issued several letters on public sector management to the different sections and they are all hidden from the public, even though it pays for this.<\/p><p> My most serious concern in the legislation concerns the new provision regarding staff at the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which covers the National Asset Management Agency,  NAMA, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  It is a shock that the Minister is doing this.  The big boys, the money people, have got the Minister.  Regarding these organisations, he is excluding from FOI information &quot;concerning the terms and conditions on which a person holds a position as a member of staff of the agency, other than when that information is contained in records in summary or collective form such that individuals cannot be identified from the record&quot;.  He is providing for the highest paid public servants to have a new exemption under freedom of information legislation in order that their terms and conditions cannot be made public.  It is a disgrace and the Minister will have to reverse it.  The financial sector has got to him to protect the people concerned.  He must withdraw this new secrecy provision for those involved in NAMA, the NPRF and the NTMA.  I will include all of these items as amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200043#RR00400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380729000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I am deputising for my colleague Deputy Mary Lou McDonald who has other engagements.  <\/p><p>  This is good legislation.  Coupled with the Protected Disclosures Bill, or the whistleblowers Bill, and the lobbying Bill, it goes some way to recognising the heightened expectation of accountability and transparency from the political system.  The programme for Government committed to restoring the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before Fianna F&aacute;il butchered it in 2003.  Naturally, the Labour Party in government has sought to undo the damage done to the legislation it first introduced in 1997.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, described Fianna F&aacute;il's gutting of the legislation in 2003 as a major step backwards for our democracy.  He was correct and let us not forget that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was a senior Government Minister when he and his colleagues discussed and agreed to hollow out the 1997 FOl legislation.  Last night the current Fianna F&aacute;il leader blamed complacency for his party's failure to introduce the kind of political reforms for which he now calls.  What a crock.  The Deputy and his then Cabinet colleagues very deliberately sought to restrict democratic oversight of public spending and Government policy making.  That is a fact and the Deputy's actions speak much louder than his words.  The Government's record on reform is not exactly something to write home about.<\/p><p>  This is important legislation, as is the whistleblowers Bill currently before the Seanad and the lobbying Bill, yet to be finalised.  If we are honest with each other, these items of legislation have long been sought and are hardly at the cutting edge of open government.  We are bringing ourselves into line with other developed democracies.  However, legislation is not enough.  As former Information Commissioner Ms Emily O'Reilly has warned, this legislation is a good move for transparency, but its full effectiveness will only become clear when people start using the laws to make requests for information.  I add a further word of caution.  If public bodies are not adequately trained and resourced to deal with FOl requests, the shift to an open government culture will not happen.  We also need to see Ministers take a full and active role in oversight.  Open government strengthens democracy and empowers citizens, bringing them into the political system.  People's increasing disengagement from politics is a problem and challenges social cohesion in a particularly corrosive way that can take decades to reverse.  There is no questioning the fact that decades of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments fundamentally damaged the State.  Money was squandered, social solidarity was hindered and the culture of a nod and wink and looking after one's own man bedded itself into political life and beyond.  Things have changed, but we need to harness that change if we are to show we are serious about opening up government and politics to all citizens.<\/p><p>  The Government's reputation on reform is not good, as the Minister knows.  It is the sharpest criticism of decision makers and opinion formers, even those who are generally well disposed to both parties.  Take the current debate on the Seanad.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael have again limited their vision to the bottom line and merely rejigged the D&aacute;il schedule and tinkered with the committee system.  That is the best they can rustle up on D&aacute;il reform.  Sinn F&eacute;in has published a package of D&aacute;il reforms as part of its campaign to abolish the Seanad.  We are serious about D&aacute;il reform and committed to giving citizens a real say in how politics works.  We want to open up government.  That is why we believe the scrapping of freedom of information fees will lead to better governance.  As was stated by Mr. Gavin Sheridan, journalist and open data advocate, during the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee, Ireland is the exception rather than the rule when it comes to fees.  This is one of just three countries that charge upfront fees for access to information where FOl or similar legislation is in place.  This is the only country in the European Union to do so.  The British House of Commons justice committee reviewed existing British FOl legislation last year and its conclusions on costs and fees are instructive.  They state FOl legislation is a significant enhancement of democracy, giving people a right to access information on the way public institutions are governed and taxpayers' money is spent.  This can act as a deterrent against wastage of public moneys or deliberate wrongdoing.  It is a health check and balance in the political system.  It is recognised that the focus of the legislation is on whether the disclosure of information is justified, not on who is asking for the information.  This is a really important point.  The media's use of FOl is sometimes portrayed by decision makers as a problem, a hindrance to the system.  Much of the information journalists seek through FOI requests can and should be put in the public domain as a matter of course.  Regardless, it should not matter who has made a request for information on the work or spending of a public body or Department.  The citizens put us here and pay our wages.  We would be horrified at the prospect of a company deliberately withholding information on fundamental business decisions from shareholders.  Why should we take a different view on the media or others seeking similar information from public bodies?<\/p><p>  The British justice committee recognised that fees at a level high enough to recoup costs would deter requests with a strong public interest and defeat the purpose of the legislation, while fees introduced for commercial and media organisations could be circumvented.  It also found that future reconsideration of the economic argument for charging would need significantly better data for the numbers of requests made under the Act and the costs incurred in responding to them.  This is of particular relevance as the Minister told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that his Department had not carried out an analysis of the fee regime in place.  In March last year the British Information Commissioner, Mr. Christopher Graham, told the Commons justice committee:<blockquote>It is a bit rich to have public authorities saying, &quot;We are assailed by unreasonable freedom of information requests,&quot; when they do not have an adequate publication scheme, they have not got their act together in terms of records management and they have a rotten website and so on.  There are things that you can do before you ever get to charging.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>Our former Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O'Reilly, speaking in 2011 on publication of her annual report, said, \"The punitive regime relating to fees should be overhauled so as not to discourage people from seeking out information.\"  It is worth remembering that following the introduction of increased fees by Fianna F&aacute;il, the number of freedom of information requests halved, which was, of course, the desired effect of the legislation.  I acknowledge that the Minister has reduced fees for an appeal to the Information Commissioner from &euro;150 to &euro;75 and promised a review of search and retrieval fees.  However, he did commit to restore the freedom of information legislation to what it was before it was undermined by Fianna F&aacute;il and application fees remain.<\/p><p> TASC estimated in 2010, based on figures provided by the Government, that the cost of freedom of information requests to the State was 0.012% of overall expenditure, correctly noting that this was far from an exorbitant price to pay for stronger democratic oversight.  Then there is the cost of administering the application fee, a cost the Minister has been unable to provide as such data are not collated centrally by his Department.  There is a real problem with open data formats which are currently limited to budget and expenditure data, as the Minister has acknowledged.  Again, TASC noted in its 2010 discussion paper that it was highly probable that the fees regime was counterproductive and cost more money to operate than it generated in most cases.<\/p><p> Retaining application fees also tells us that the closed culture associated with Fianna F&aacute;il prevails within the Government and across the civil and public service.  The retention of application fees tells us that the Government and the senior civil servants who advise it still perceive freedom of information legislation as a gifting of information, rather than a fundamental right of citizens in a mature democracy.  This is a problem.  If the Minister cannot shift his mandarins on this issue, what hope does Ireland have of full participation in the open government partnership when and if it happens?<\/p><p> Moving on from fees, there is much in the Bill that is welcome.  The reduction of the period of exemption for Cabinet papers and the extension of freedom of information legislation to a new layer of public bodies significantly funded by the State are welcome.  The restriction on information on the Garda is something at which we need to look, as we need to look at some of the other exemptions.  There are provisions in the Bill that appear to facilitate refusals, but we can explore these matters on Committee Stage.  The obligation on public bodies to produce a &quot;publication scheme&quot; to replace previous freedom of information manuals will not in itself shift the culture to an open government environment.  I cannot emphasise enough the real need for resourcing, training and oversight.  This is a theme to which we must return.<\/p><p> The introduction of the Bill is a positive step and I look forward to dealing with the issues raised on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will come to it with an open mind.  We will submit a number of amendments at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200046#UU00200","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380729600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>On the surface, the apparent move in the proposed Bill to undo the draconian amendments made to the Freedom of Information Bill by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in 2003 represents an improvement in Ireland's freedom of information legislation.  However, within the proposed Bill there are striking conditions that undermine its integrity and reveal that the apparent move of good faith, as professed by the Minister, is an illusion.<\/p><p>  Among the welcome measures are a reduction in fees, the provision of access to Cabinet papers after five years instead of ten, that communications between Ministers are no longer <i>de facto<\/i> to be off limits to disclosure, while the scope of records covered by exemptions is to be narrowed.  We also see the inclusion of a number of previously exempt statutory bodies under the Bill such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Central Bank.  However, woven into the fabric of the Bill are conditions that make a mockery of these welcome moves.  Furthermore, even if these measures were not undermined by the internal logic of the Bill, they would not go far enough to stay in keeping with the internationally understood spirit of the freedom of information movement, or for that matter with the proclaimed purpose of the Bill which states it is being enacted &quot;to enable members of the public to obtain access, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy, to information in the possession of public bodies and other bodies in receipt of funding from the State&quot;.<\/p><p>  On closer inspection, the Bill is not about transparency and openness; through a lack of definition and wildly liberal interpretations of the notions of &quot;public interest&quot; and &quot;right to privacy&quot;, it manages to uphold a culture of secrecy and deception that seems to be inherent to modern Irish politics.  We are facing a critical juncture.  With the advent of new technologies that have a massive impact on how societies are informed, monitored and organise themselves, we see a massive international discussion about the role of government in people's lives, its relation to international capital and, ultimately, what a government would actually look like in a genuinely inclusive democratic state.  Yesterday, at the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr. Edward Snowden, referring to the vibrant discussion taking place worldwide, said: &quot;We see brave executives remembering that if a public is prevented from knowing how they are being governed, the necessary result is that they are no longer self-governing.  And we see the public reclaiming an equal seat at the table of government.&quot;  A few of us had the opportunity to meet Mr. Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London this summer, which was interesting to say the least.  While the state seems keen to interfere and record the private correspondence of citizens, it seems more reluctant than ever for citizens to see or understand what it actually does.<\/p><p>  Article 40.6.1.<sup>.<\/sup>i of the Constitution maintains that the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of a citizen's rights to express freely their convictions and opinions, including criticism of Government policy, while highlighting the grave importance of the education of public opinion.  With this in mind, it is fascinating to see how much of the proposed Bill reads like a veto of that enshrined right.  In section 6(3) it states the Minister may, by order, declare any public body or any other body covered by it exempt from freedom of information, something the Minister has already done with the exclusion of, for example, An Post, Dublin Bus, CIE, ESB, the National Oil Reserves Agency, Tourism Ireland and VHI.  Section 34(1) goes on to allow the Minister to declare any record exempt from disclosure, if asked to do so.<\/p><p>  Another provision which has already been substantially fulfilled, with section 40(1)(<i>a<\/i>), among others, discloses a long list of exemptions that prohibit the people from understanding how the Government conducts its financial affairs.  Great noise has been made about the inclusion of NAMA and the NTMA in the Bill, but then in Schedule 1(n) the Minister exempts almost all documents of interest that these bodies possess.  The people are very interested in knowing how NAMA operates.  They have every right to know how it operates.  That might help them to understand some of the blatant inconsistencies in how it deals with different individuals.<\/p><p>  Section 42(<i>j<\/i>) states the Bill does not apply to documents given by an FOI body to a member of the Government or a Minister of State for use by him or her for the purposes of proceedings in either House of the Oireachtas or any committee of either or both such Houses or any subcommittee of such a committee.  This section essentially states the Government thinks lobbying, one of the most underhand activities in modern politics, should go unchecked.  Running counter to what the Government desires, the truth is that policy making does not and should not take place in a vacuum.  There is too much at stake and far too many people are affected by the Government's decisions.  Accordingly, the activities of lobbyists and the lobbied should be transparent, in accordance with the public interest, as any reasonable person would interpret freedom of information.<\/p><p> The recommendations of the open government partnership with regard to lobbying are particularly interesting in this respect.  It states that the regulation of lobbying Bill should be strengthened to ensure it regulates lobbyists and the public representatives and officials who are the subject of lobbying.  The proposed Bill focuses on transparency on the part of lobbyists, but the lobbied - public bodies, public officials, and office holders - should also be subject to enhanced transparency requirements, including default publication of written submissions on public policy by lobbyists; an updated code of conduct for elected representatives and public servants at national and local level; publication of ministerial and advisory diaries; and requirements for all policies and legislation to include details of the organisations with which the Department or Minister has been in contact during the preparation of the proposal.  It is almost laughable that if the Bill comes into force the first object of the regulation of lobbying Bill, which is to ensure there is an appropriate degree of transparency in the development of public policy, the preparation of legislation and public administration and decision-making, will effectively be null and void.<\/p><p> Although the reduction in fees is to be welcomed, a paper by TASC's Nat O'Connor has shown that the fees regime does not lead to any cost recovery and is in fact likely to add to the total administrative costs.  If this is the case with the outgoing fees system, then the proposed fees structure makes even less sense and simultaneously reveals clearly the purpose of the fees, which is plainly and simply a tactic to discourage the public from using this invaluable service.  Gordon Brown's comments in October 2007 are instructive on this point.  He stated that when anything is provided without cost it risks being open to abuse.  He also stated that his Government did not believe more restrictive rules on the cost limits of freedom of information requests were the way forward.  He stated that the Government had dropped its restrictions proposal because of the risk such a proposal might have placed unacceptable barriers between the people and public information.  He stated that public information does not belong to the Government but to the public on whose behalf government is conducted, and wherever possible this should be the guiding principle behind the implementation of the UK's Freedom of Information Act.<\/p><p> Since the publication of the Bill earlier this year, the Minister has portrayed himself as the great agent of the restoration of progressive freedom of information legislation in Ireland, and much of the Irish media has, for the most part, faithfully regurgitated this line.  The truth is that the proposed Bill is riddled with get-out clauses which in effect undermine the championed moves towards improved transparency, accountability, and the citizen's right to know what happens in his or her name.<\/p><p> Under the proposed legislation there is simply too much of which the public will be kept in ignorance, but this is no earth-shattering surprise.  This is the <i>status quo<\/i>in the relationship between power and truth.  The 2005 Nobel laureate, Harold Pinter, reflected acutely on this failed marriage when he stated there are many truths which rebound off each other, challenge each other, and demand teasing out.  He said:<blockquote>Political language, as used by politicians, does not venture into any of this territory since the majority of politicians, on the evidence available to us, are interested not in truth but in power and in the maintenance of that power.  To maintain that power it is essential that people remain in ignorance, that they live in ignorance of the truth, even the truth of their own lives.  What surrounds us therefore is a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we feed.<\/blockquote> Thomas Jefferson once stated that every day a citizen must be a participator in the government of affairs.  The Bill in its present form effectively discourages and limits the scope of the Irish citizen's participation in our so-called democracy.  Inscribed into the Bill is a consolidation of the secrecy of the State and how it operates.  This represents a cowardliness on the part of the elected towards the electorate, and also an act of supreme arrogance by the Government.  The information in question is the property of the citizens of the State.  For the Government to be able to effectively pick and choose what, when and how the people of Ireland learn about what the elected Government does in their name flies in the face of any professed notions of inclusiveness, openness, and transparency - notions that should be the bedrock of any democracy worthy of the name.<\/p><p> If democracy in Ireland is to flourish, and the trust the Government has lost by repeatedly testing the patience of this country's citizens is to be restored, much more transparency, openness, and inclusion should scream from the Bill, but I am afraid it does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200047#VV00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380730200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome the discussion of this legislation.  There is no doubt that the butchering of the 1997 Act by Fianna F&aacute;il was absolutely and utterly reprehensible, and it was somewhat amusing to listen to its spokesperson's contribution earlier in this context.  That said, the idea that the Minister has moulded himself into some great liberator and defender of democracy, going boldly where nobody else ever has, is really stretching it a bit and does not stand up to any serious examination.  In his press statement at the launch of the Bill last week, the Minister stated that the legislation would strongly complement the substantial progress made on a suite of significant Government reform measures to achieve greater openness, transparency and accountability and strengthen public governance and good governance throughout the system.  People reading this would have been amazed, wondering what he was speaking about and where this openness and transparency was.  He went on to tell us where it was, with a few pretty unfortunate examples.  He started with the Bill regarding Oireachtas inquiries into the banking sector, with which problems have already emerged, with talk of the exclusion of Anglo Irish Bank and much other evidence, and people who have authority in these matters have stated that an Oireachtas inquiry will not get to the bottom of what went on.  He also cited the whistleblower legislation which has been published.  This is also an unfortunate example because the treatment of the most prominent whistleblowers in the State in recent years - namely, the two Garda whistleblowers on penalty points - proves that transparency and openness is not alive and well under the Government, particularly in view of the way in which they were treated by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner.  These people who had information and wanted an open and transparent society used the mechanisms they had and went to the confidential recipient.  The information was brought to the Minister and then went to the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Members of the Oireachtas and members of the Road Safety Authority.  They should not have had to go to any of these organisations.  In any case, their efforts resulted in the unearthing of the scandal of termination of penalty points.  They were proved accurate in this sense, and the loss of revenue to the State and the loss of credibility of the system has been exposed.  The only people who suffered for it were those who blew the whistle.  If this is the openness and transparency we are speaking about, and this is the context in which we are putting the Bill, it really falls short of what is possible and necessary.<\/p><p>  When we are discussing the Bill we must start with the absolute right to information.  The only information that should be withheld is information which relates to an individual's privacy, and nothing else counts.  In some instances one could say that the security of the State should be considered, but in an Irish context this does not count for much.  If we were adhering to our role as a neutral country it would matter even less.<\/p><p>  We have a peculiar situation in Ireland in which most people get their information from the media.  The media have an incredibly cavalier approach to people's individual privacy.  They have no problem with invading it every day of the week in circumstances, and with information, of no relevance to the public whatsoever.  This same media have no appetite whatsoever to unearth and uncover information that would be in the public good.  The days of investigative journalism have been sadly diminished.  We had a classic example in which an investigative journalist who did this job was forcibly made redundant - the case of Gemma O'Doherty from the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  This is a reflection of the fact that the media is owned by a small number of private individuals who carry enormous political sway and who do not call the Government to account.  I am not surprised by this, given the bailouts Independent News &amp;amp; Media has received.<\/p><p>  In this context of the privatisation of media information, the State's handling of public information is even more important because it is the people's information.  I agree with Deputy Wallace.  We had the privilege of meeting Julian Assange during the summer, and what Wikileaks has done shows the power of information.  Information released by Wikileaks on corruption and deals behind the scenes in Iceland between the politicians and the banking sector led to the Icelandic people coming out on the streets, which prevented the scenario we ended up enduring here, in which our banks were bailed out.<\/p><p>They are much better off as a result.  Information is good and if people are doing their jobs properly, they should have no problem with it being unearthed.<\/p><p> The problem with the Bill is exactly as Deputy Mick Wallace outlined.  The Bill in its entirety gives the Minister massive powers to exempt organisations and documents from disclosure.  Other sections suggest it is a case of &quot;You do not have to give information if it is a bit too much work for you,&quot; &quot;If it is a little bit tedious and if you have to analyse the information, no, you do not have to do that&quot;, or &quot;You do not have to disclose the liabilities of State or public bodies.&quot;   The Bill is based on curtailing information and making excuses in that regard.<\/p><p> We already have a very difficult climate.  While it is very good that the fees are being reduced, all of the methods which have been used to prevent people from getting information are alive and well in the Minister's proposals in this new legislation.  I know residents who have spent years and probably hundreds of euro - they have been asked for thousands in some instances by the local authority, Fingal County Council - to find documents relating to the planning of homes which have been proved to be a fire safety hazard from a developer who has been engaged in such practices in other jurisdictions also.  The idea that somebody should have to pay all that money and be met with the response, &quot;No, we cannot do all that work and we cannot unearth those documents,&quot; or &quot;If you really want them, it is going to cost you a couple of grand,&quot; is completely unacceptable.  I do not believe the Bill breaks from that spirit.  In fact, it enshrines that mentality which curtails rather than frees up information.<\/p><p> There are a number of other weakening measures in the Bill which are not to be welcomed.  The current position requires bodies to maintain an index of precedents.  This is important because it empowers the public to access these precedents and ensures the decisions being arrived at are made in a fair and impartial manner, that like cases are treated consistently and so on.  This is the very essence, if one likes, of freedom of information.  However, the Bill curtails this.  It extinguishes the right to have this record of precedents held, which goes against the grain in terms of what freedom of information should mean.  Moreover, it unmasks the Government's intentions in that regard because if people do not know whether they have been treated in an equal fashion, how are they to get the documentary evidence which they can obtain at present?  Under this new legislation, they will have to go before the courts to seek discovery.  What citizen can do this against the backdrop of austerity?<\/p><p> That brings me to a really important area which is exempt from the legislation, which is, of course, the courts.  I cannot credit why they would be excluded from this process unless, of course, one is dealing with sensitive family law or <i>in camera<\/i>cases.  Anything else should be open to the public.  This is an enormous area which is in the spotlight because of the backlog of appeals to the Supreme Court.  Questions have been raised by some citizens as to why we have such a volume of appeals.  Is it, perhaps, that the work being done in the lower courts and the judgments being made are not the best, that more people are looking for appeals as a result and that, therefore, they are looking for relevant information.  The State spent &euro;16 million on a digital audio recording system for the courts which has been in place in the Supreme Court since 2005, the High Court since 2009 and the District Court since 2011, but we do not use it.  We do not give people access to that information which could validly record what actually goes on in court and undo many of the mistakes which ultimately lead to appeals being taken.  Given that the State has invested in a digital recording system to record what goes on in the courts, surely all court documents and information on the courts should be open to the public also.  If we were serious about it, we would be looking at these areas.<\/p><p> Another loophole stems from the way in which the Minister has formulated the legislation in that, for the new organisations that have been added on - the Central Bank and the Garda - only records since 2008 will be obtainable.  Obviously, the justification is that they did not know they would have to produce them; therefore, it would be a bit hard for them to go back any further.  I do not accept that and we now have a problem.  What about all the records dating from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s?  Obviously, under the 30 year rule, some Government records do become available.  However, we are going to have to wait for all the documents between 1984 and 2008, which were very interesting years, that will effectively remain secret.  There was no need to do this.  We could have included them in the legislation and this should be done on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> A radical overhaul of the freedom of information system is necessary and would have been very welcome, but that is not what this is, unfortunately.  It is putting a little sticking plaster on some of the butchery conducted in this area by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200048#WW00200","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380730800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>That is hardly fair.

Information is empowering and belongs to the people.  It should not be given at the diktat of individuals, be they Ministers or senior civil servants, who would have the power to decide \"No, you lesser person are not entitled to know that.\"  Having an educated population, an informed people, is the best way to govern and is the only way in which we can really talk about reform.

In researching for this contribution one of the things that stood out the most and which the last two contributions highlighted very starkly was the caution with which the Bill was welcomed by those such as the Information Commissioner and other commentators.  It is very telling, when legislation is brought forward, that it can only be welcomed with caution.  How we will gauge the success of the Bill depends on how its spirit is implemented after it is enacted.  When we are introducing legislation, we should be very clear on what it seeks to achieve and what needs to happen with it.  We should not see caution expressed in welcoming a Bill and the changes to take place.  This is particularly the case with something as important as a freedom of information Bill which is one of the few ways in which citizens can acquire information to see how decisions which affect their daily lives are being made in their names or on their behalf.  The Bill needs to be amended on Committee Stage to remove some of the uncertainty and some of the get-out clauses that the Minister and public bodies have with regard to the information they can release to members of the public.  This is very important and the issue needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  When the original Freedom of Information Bill was introduced in 1997, it started a real culture of change within public bodies.  I was working with Donegal County Council at the time and remember that it caused a lot of concern for council officials because they would have to be accountable, keep records and be able to stand over decisions they had made.  It did start that process of cultural change and changed how bodies dealt with matters and operated their decision making processes.  It opened up decision making to transparency such that it could be looked at by citizens who could gauge whether it was effective and it made officials do their jobs properly.<\/p><p>  In 2003, however, Fianna F&aacute;il infamously amended the Freedom of Information Act, put all of the restrictions in place and introduced fees which undermined all of the provisions included in what had been progressive legislation.  While this Bill undoes many of the amendments brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il, which has to be welcomed, again, we come back to how its spirit will be implemented after it becomes law.  That is the key point.  It will probably only be in two or three years time that we will actually be able to see how effective this legislation has been, if at all, and how it has opened up decision making in the State to transparency.<\/p><p> I welcome some of the Bill's provisions, particularly the inclusion of a range of new bodies under the remit of the freedom of information regime.  The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are especially important inclusions given that the operation of the refugee system in this country in the past 11 or 12 years has brought the State into disrepute.  There has been no transparency or openness, with decisions apparently made on an entirely arbitrary basis.  Some of the most vulnerable people in the State have been left in a state of uncertainty for long periods, with no access to recourse.  Some have been living in direct provision for more than ten years without any sign of a decision being made to clarify their status.  If the possibility had been there to submit freedom of information requests on behalf of these people, it might have speeded up the entire process.<\/p><p> I also welcome the inclusion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the remit of these provisions.  Again, however, the question arises as to why that remit is limited to the force's administrative records.  There are already sufficient provisions in the existing legislation in terms of State security to allow Garda authorities ample scope to refuse requests.  That safeguard is already in place.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be opened up fully to freedom of information scrutiny.  No public body should be afraid of accountability.  Rather, all public bodies should be striving to provide as much accountability as possible.  This particular restriction is perhaps reflective of the power of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to insist that its role in our society, as it sees it, be protected.<\/p><p> The omission of Irish Water is puzzling.  The reason given is that to include it would potentially lead to the release of commercially sensitive information.  Consider, however, that Irish Rail, which, like Irish Water, is a semi-State monopoly operating on behalf of citizens, does come under the remit of these provisions.  It does not make sense that one should be included and the other omitted.<\/p><p> I welcome the removal of the restriction which precluded the provision of information regarding the deliberative processes operating within Departments.  It is important to see how particular decisions are arrived at and ultimately agreed.  In that context, will the Minister indicate why the exemption in regard to parliamentary briefings and draft replies to parliamentary questions is to be retained?  It would be very interesting to have access to the original drafts of replies before they go on the record.  I am not convinced by the argument that the Official Report provides all the accountability that is required.  It seems very likely, for example, that some parliamentary question replies would go through several drafts before being released.  Removing this restriction would open Departments up to a great deal of welcome scrutiny in terms of how decisions are made and how replies can be made woolly by filling them up with useless information in order to disguise the failure to provide the information that is actually being sought.<\/p><p> While I welcome the reduction in fees, the provision in this regard does not go far enough.  If we want to be entirely open and transparent, there should be no charge associated with the submission of a freedom of information request.  In particular, Departments should no longer be allowed to set their own retrieval fees.  If there is to be a fee at all, it should be a set fee.<\/p><p> As I noted earlier, it is interesting to see Members on all sides welcoming this Bill with caution.  Unfortunately, however, it will take at least two or three years before we can really see how it is working in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200049#XX00400","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380731400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  In its short time in office the Rainbow Government of 1994 to 1997, led by a fellow Meath man, John Bruton, achieved great strides in opening up and modernising the State.  The Freedom of Information Act 1997 was an important part of that programme.  In introducing the Bill to the D&aacute;il, the then Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, stated:<blockquote>Information is power and access to information is fundamental to the reform of our democratic institutions to create genuine openness and to empower the ordinary citizen.<\/blockquote>This achievement, which was motivated by the greater public interest and was primarily for the benefit of the people but also of voluntary organisations, academics and the media, suffered a serious setback with the introduction of the 2003 Act.  It is important to reflect on the reasons that the great strides we had made should have been pushed back.  The 2002 general election was fought against the backdrop of an Irish and global economy still trying to process the consequences of the attack on the Twin Towers and the earlier dotcom crash.  Ireland was and still is a small open economy positioning itself to take advantage of favourable head winds.  At that time interest rates began to tumble in an effort to keep the global economy afloat, a dangerous prospect for a country like Ireland where home ownership is paramount owing to our experiences in the land war.<\/p><p>  These realities did not sit well with the electoral plans of the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and were ignored in the lead-up to the 2002 general election.  Public spending not only increased dramatically in line with the election cycle, it was also front-loaded into the first five months of 2002.  This meant that cuts in the second half of the year were inevitable and, by the standards of that time, traumatic.  This was clear to be seen but forcefully denied by members of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government until such time as freedom of information requests under the 1997 Act proved otherwise later in 2002.  Those revelations angered the public, which rightly felt that it had been conned.  Having been elected to the D&aacute;il for the first time in 2002, I have vivid memories of these events.  In fact, the demise of the freedoms given in the 1997 Act by its amendment in 2003 was one of the main political controversies in my first year in this House.<\/p><p>  I am proud to be part of a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government that is fulfilling its general election and programme for Government commitments to political reform by putting a new freedom of information Bill before the House.  It is a Bill which rightly and justly restores the pre-2003 position.  By its openness and transparency, it puts to bed the more idiotic Fianna F&aacute;il and media commentary around the forthcoming referendum on the abolition of the Seanad which seeks to suggest that this Republic is slipping into a dictatorship.  That is far from the reality.  This Government is not afraid to operate in a transparent way.  We are not hiding anything from the people.  We do not operate from one election to the other, unlike previous Governments which brought us to where we are today following their actions in the 2002 and 2007 ballots.  We are restoring the Republic, stone upon stone, as Michael Collins might have said, after 14 years of Fianna F&aacute;il misrule which saw a squandering of resources and opportunities and of people's hopes and their potential.  That party in government failed during the boom years to prepare this country, with its small open economy, in such a way that might have made it capable of handling the effects of international crises.  Indeed, I often wonder whether things would have got quite so out of control between 2000 and 2008 if there had been access for Opposition politicians and journalists to a more open freedom of information regime.<\/p><p>  This Bill goes further than a mere restoration of the pre-2003 position.  I welcome, in particular, the extension of its remit to other public bodies and bodies in receipt of significant public moneys.  The inclusion of non-security sensitive elements of the administrative functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is especially welcome.  There have nevertheless been claims that the legislation does not go far enough.  The reality is that we have advanced significantly from the position of the past ten years and are now on a totally new level of accountability compared with the pre-1997 position.  We must, at the same time, be hard nosed and realistic in terms of protecting commercially sensitive information.<\/p><p>  I note and welcome the input into the Bill of the many interested parties who attended the public hearings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in the first quarter of this year.  It was very encouraging to hear Emily O'Reilly's comments that the Bill represents a positive step towards greater transparency.  The people of this country can be very proud of Ms O'Reilly as she assumes her new role as European Ombudsman.<\/p><p>  I also welcome the move to reduce some of the fees associated with freedom of information requests and to review the search and retrieval costs.  Some people have expressed the view that the remaining fees are excessive, but we must bear in mind that the fulfilment of any freedom of information request will carry some cost.  The new charges are certainly more realistic and fair compared with what went before.  The increase in fees in 2003 was responsible for a marked tailing off in the general interest in and availing of the freedom of information regime for many years.  In more recent times the economic crisis and the desire to gain an understanding of how it could have happened has helped to spark a new interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200050#YY00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380731400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mortgage Restructuring Arrangement Bill 2013: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1380732000,"counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200051#ZZ00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380732000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380732000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille cuimsitheach at&aacute; curtha i l&aacute;thair an T&iacute; seo ag an Teachta Collins.

The crisis has got out of control.  There have been efforts by the Government to get it under control but the efforts have been deficient and those deficiencies have been pointed out from day one by this party.  I discussed this in the Chamber last week.<\/p><p>  Since 2009, the number of people in mortgage distress has quadrupled.  It doubled over the first two years of the crisis under the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and doubled again under this Government.  The value of arrears now stands at &euro;19 billion and new details show that long-term arrears are continuing to grow, while new cases of arrears, much like the economy, are stagnant or decreasing slightly.  That is encouraging, and the Government has put a lot of faith in the fact that early arrears are being dealt with, but it is important to dig deeper into the statistics.  The Minister of State is familiar with people who have not gone into the 90-day arrears bracket and are not included in the number of those in mortgage distress.  People may be offered interest-only options.  I met a person recently who is very close to pension age.  She has a debt to the bank of &euro;180,000 and, after the minimum expenditure guidelines, has a disposable income of &euro;400.  For three years the bank put her on interest-only payments.  That person is unable to pay the mortgage and will never be in a position to pay the mortgage because of her age profile.  However, she does not fall into the category of those in mortgage distress because of the short-term solutions being used by banks to keep people out of that accounting category.  We must be careful when we look at figures and breakdowns to get to the real statistics and the real stories behind those.<\/p><p>  The information on new restructuring arrangements for quarter 2 this year shows that the banks are still relying on short-term fixes.  It is becoming obvious that when pushed to offer permanent solutions, they have turned straight to repossession or voluntary surrender.  It is clear they are not co-operating by offering realistic sustainable solutions to families.  That became clear when the banks came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The information we extracted from them was that they relied on 16,000 legal repossession or eviction letters to meet the targets set by the Government and the Central Bank.<\/p><p>  In response to a parliamentary question last week, the Minister for Finance stated &quot;Letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered as a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets, and should only ever be considered after every possible avenue for solution has been exhausted.&quot;  I asked the Governor of the Central Bank if he agreed with this statement, and in his glib way he turned around and said that he always agrees with the Minister for Finance.  In the document released in early March, the Governor and the Government allowed for repossessions to be used as a tool to meet targets. <\/p><p>  We need to get to the crux of this matter.  Tens of thousands of families are in financial distress and other distress in respect of mental health, relationships within families, relationships with children and relationships with spouses.  These relationships are under serious pressure as a result of the spiralling debt weighing down on them.  They need and want solutions to be offered by the banks.  The Minister needs to lift the telephone to the Governor and say that it is not acceptable for the banks to rely on repossession letters to meet the targets.  That is not the spirit in which the targets were set.  The need for the targets arose because of the pressure put on the Government by us and others in society to tell the banks that they needed to do more.  It was never intended that the way in which they would do more was by issuing letters of eviction, repossession or voluntary surrender.  It is clear the banks are running rings around the Government.  The Government is impotent and will not stand up to the banks.  It has continually defended the interests of the banks over those of people in mortgage distress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200051#ZZ00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1380732000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>It has not done so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200051#ZZ00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1380732000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Deputy Buttimer may have his chance to speak.<\/p><p>  We have seen the code of conduct for mortgage arrears, which the Government supported, being changed.

The targets set clearly allow for repossessions to take place.  When the targets were set, I said that I hoped they would fulfil the Government's intention.  However, I was sceptical because it is clear that the banks have behaved in an uncooperative fashion for the past five years.<\/p><p>  What is being delivered in Deputy Joan Collins's Bill is positive in respect of protecting the family home.  However, I have concerns about how it relies on the framework of the Personal Insolvency Act.  The Act is only newborn and it has been a difficult birth.  It is still in a fragile state and we know that questions have been asked about it in the Grant Thornton report and because of the lack of personal insolvency practitioners.  In County Donegal there is only one personal insolvency practitioner.  There is a real need for public personal insolvency practitioners so that no one is denied the service.  The veto for the banks is also an issue and that is why we have argued for an independent body to enforce realistic solutions and sustainable restructuring above the heads of the banks so that we can get to the endgame in this process.  That is the key.  The banks' veto must be challenged and removed as a path to real and sustainable agreement for those with mortgage debt they cannot repay.<\/p><p>  The figure of 110% of current market value, referred to in the Bill, is inappropriate in legislation.  We need to deal with this on a case-by-case basis and we need to include write-downs of debt on a case-by-case basis.  The spirit of the Bill is correct but we would like to tease out some technical elements further.  It is important that we allow the proposal from Deputy Joan Collins to move to Committee Stage.  It is a constructive proposal and we should tease it out.<\/p><p>  It is clear that, from day one, the Minister and the Government have protected the vested interests of the banks.  I talked about the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the reliance on repossession letters and the removal of the Dunne judgment.  The Minister also protected senior bankers.  In the case of the Anglo Irish Bank tapes, the two people involved were protected in senior positions by this Government.<\/p><p> Not one of the thousands of staff earning above &euro;100,000 in any of the banks took as much as a penny reduction in their basic pay as a result of Mercer.

There is growing frustration with the progress that has been made to date.  That said, the targets the banks have been set to achieve have only recently been finalised and they are at between the first quarter and the first half of that.<\/p><p>  In contradiction of what Deputy Pearse Doherty stated, I would welcome the Minister, Deputy Shatter's, comment that he recognises &quot;that in appropriate cases, the reconstruction of debt in mortgage arrangements will lead where appropriate to the writing off of a portion of outstanding capital.  This is an approach and a reality that to date has been avoided by our financial institutions&quot;.<\/p><p>  Having listened to the banks and the Governor of the Central Bank on a number of occasions, that statement of the Minister is true and I welcome it.  The banks seem to be completely ignoring the reality that a significant amount of the capital that has been put into them by the Irish taxpayer must ultimately be used for the write-down of some portion of debt.  Both Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Noonan, in conjunction with the Governor, who states he may require further legislation, are open to that.  As we move towards the end of this process and tunnel down towards those who would pay if they could, who, if they were forced to leave their homes, would have nowhere else to go, and who would represent a significant burden on the State, that will require further legislation and guidelines.  I welcome that the aforementioned Ministers and the Governor are more than aware of that.<\/p><p>  We have a massive problem due the lack of potential to cobble together short-term debt with mortgage debt.  Many are paying short-term debt because they must and they are not paying their mortgages.  For example, a constituent who came in to me owes &euro;18,000 in short-term debt which is costing him &euro;1,035 a month.  His &euro;105,000 mortgage is costing him &euro;735 a month.  Together, these amount to a payment of &euro;1,770 a month for debt of &euro;123,000.  If he could bundle it all together and re-mortgage, he would pay &euro;850 a month, which he can afford.  The mortgage lender, because his mortgage is in distress and because the other debts are with other institutions, does not want to take that on.  That, of course, could be averaged out among the industry.  That is something to which we must give further consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200052#AAA01000","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1380732600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House.<\/p><p>  Unlike Deputy Pearse Doherty, I and those on this side of the House are motivated to help those who are in genuine distress.

The issue is of concern to all of us.  In our offices, families and communities, every week since this crash has happened we encounter those who are in difficulty.<\/p><p>  The economic crash has had a profound impact on the quality of the lives of so many.  As I stated at the beginning, we are committed to restructuring and helping those in difficulty get their lives back.  The priority of the Government is to restart the economy, create jobs and end the mortgage distress for so many citizens.  That is why the Government enacted the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 and established the Insolvency Service of Ireland to address the legitimate fears and concerns.<\/p><p>  What is unacceptable is that banks are not engaging with homeowners.  It is unacceptable, for example, that a bank, at ten to five on a Friday evening of a bank holiday weekend, rang a customer telling him he must repay his borrowings when the bank knew the family had no way of paying.  Such persons must be allowed to remain living in and retain ownership of the family home.  While we hear talk from the banks, and we read their advertisements in newspapers and hear their advertisements on television and radio, are the banks engaging with homeowners?  I accept we must differentiate between those who are genuinely trying to pay their multiplicity of bills and keep their lives going and those who are abdicating their responsibility by not paying.  As the Minister, Deputy Shatter, stated last night, our objective is to do everything on the development and introduction of various debt resolution processes.<\/p><p>  I will conclude with one case that came to me only yesterday afternoon, where customers who engaged with Bank of Scotland Ireland and its agent Certus are waiting since June last for a reply.  They have made numerous attempts to engage with the bank since then.  They have been fobbed off with replies that the bank has no decision made and does not know, yet they get a letter stating that they owe X amount of money.  The couple knew this and were trying to restructure, but the bank will not engage.  The responsibility rests with the banks to engage properly and I would call on the banks to engage responsibly rather than irresponsibly with the home owners because this is about the family home.  We must not allow a situation where lives are disrupted by the greed of a few.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200052#AAA01500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1380732600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Bill from the Technical Group.  This has been one of the most pressing issues that this Government, or any Government, would probably ever have to face.<\/p><p>  The crux of this problem is we now know that the targets have been set for the banks and, as anyone listening to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in the past couple of weeks will have heard, they are hitting their targets without difficulty.  The real problem with all of this is in determining what is a sustainable solution.  It is easy to offer a deal and say that one has done that part, and that achieves one's percentage target, but what will be the sustainable solution for these individuals to restart their lives?  We must remember that such individuals who cannot pay their mortgages are not really living.  They are not spending.  Towns in mainly rural constituencies such as Galway East, for instance, Loughrey, Tuam and Athenry, are starving because such individuals in these areas are not spending.<\/p><p>  Another problem we must face up to is it is easy to give the banks a kicking.  We, on both sides of the House, have done it for the past number of years.  It goes down well with the public.  We all understand we need a banking sector of some sort but the point about it is the banks must remember they are only there because taxpayers' money bailed them out.<\/p><p>  The other problem we have is this issue of writing off significant amounts of debt.  I suppose the elephant in the room is that if we start writing down significant amounts of debt on all of these issues, while it may solve the problem for the person involved, will we eventually have to come back and bail out these banks again with more public money due to the debt that they are in?  The other side of that is these banks are kept there by the mortgage holders and there is an obligation on the banks to get them out of these problems.  It always goes back to the importance of sustainable solutions.<\/p><p>As other speakers said, people raise local issues with me.  The biggest issue is the manner in which the banks deal with individual customers.  A constituent of mine was repaying her mortgage by putting money into the bank at the end of every week.  After three months she received a letter and a call from the bank to say she was in mortgage arrears and that the bank had not received mortgage repayments for the past three months.  The bank said the payments may have been lost or mislaid by the bank.  The very unnecessary strain on this person is unacceptable.  Thankfully, she had receipts to prove that she had indeed lodged the money into those bank accounts.  <\/p><p> There is an onus on the banks to solve these problems but the solutions must be sustainable and must allow for people to stay in their homes.  We bailed out the banks and we do not want to do it again.  They must provide mortgage-holders with a sustainable solution so that they can kick-start their lives again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200052#AAA01600","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380733200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I accept Deputy Joan Collins' bona fides in introducing this Bill.  I accept it is a response to the very tragic circumstances in which people have found themselves and I am aware of the human tragedies that have accompanied this mess.  Most of us have no sympathy for the banks.<\/p><p>  Deputy Collins seeks to introduce an Act that will, among other things, provide for the restructuring and disposal of certain mortgage arrears and, where practical, the retention of the principal private residence - the family home - for the debtor.  This Bill suggests the introduction of a new approach in a personal insolvency arrangement, namely, a mortgage restructuring arrangement.  This would provide that a personal insolvency practitioner could propose a once-off mortgage restructuring arrangement on behalf of a debtor for a secured debt on a principal private residence or where the debtor owns only one property.<\/p><p>  What I regard as somewhat unusual is that it would add a fourth option in debt resolution to the three already set up by the Government in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  The Bill borrows from that Act certain criteria for eligibility for assistance.  The main proposal would allow the forced restructuring of a secure mortgage debt on a creditor by effectively forcing the individual to write off part of the debt.  For example, the proposed process allows a debtor to appoint a PIP who would then prepare a proposal for a mortgage restructuring arrangement to submit to the creditors.  Mandatory provisions require that repayment be made on the terms laid out by the PIP alone and these would be binding on the creditor.  The creditor would not be permitted to take any enforcement or other actions against the debtor.  The creditor would, however, be allowed to appeal the decision of the PIP to the court, but only so long as he or she is deemed to have fully co-operated with the PIP.  There is a possibility that the rights of secured creditors under the Constitution would be infringed.  I can understand the Deputy's wish to help those in trouble but this Bill is not workable in its present state, nor does it take into the account the difference between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  There is a risk that people would decide to default if they think the law is on their side.  This also runs contrary to the arrangement set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  There could be many creditors such as local authorities which employ many staff and create much employment.  I ask whether they are to write off such debts.  The Personal Insolvency Act has put in place a code of conduct for those unfortunate enough to find themselves in mortgage arrears.  The resolution targets set out by the Central Bank for financial institutions and the protection by the courts of those seeking the adjournment of a repossession action constitute a significant set of responses by the Government to the mortgage arrears problem.  The newly established personal insolvency arrangement needs time to settle in, but I accept the Deputy's bona fides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200053#BBB00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1380733200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.

I will use my time to make that point and to speak about the current situation for my constituents.  I can say that my constituents are living in the present tense.  There are parallel universes.  The commentary is about the deficit in America, the closing down of the American Government this week and the UK's agreement to austerity but not until 2016.  We get on with the business of the hard work and the hard measures in this country, where people are still living in the present tense.  For example, five or six years ago my constituents were able to talk about how long they had left on their mortgages, but nobody is having that conversation now.  People are no longer discussing how many years are left on their mortgages because they are like the rabbit in the headlights; they are living in the fearful present tense.  They are worried about the end of the week and whether they have enough money in the bank account to pay the mortgage at the end of the month.  They do not dare to think about six months or a year down the line.  <\/p><p>  The banks have a responsibility to engage in a constructive way with their customers rather than just phoning and e-mailing them.  As a public representative acting as a third party I am treated with disdain by some of the banks.  They will say that such information is sensitive.  I commend the Technical Group on its introduction of this Bill, even though I disagree with some aspects.  There should be a better mechanism to allow us, as public representatives and legislators - the messengers of the people - to represent people who are in a hole, and there are a lot of people in that dark, black hole at the minute.  It would be a good thing if we could arrange such a mechanism collectively in this House.  The perception of the productivity of this House is on the floor.<\/p><p> My last point refers to bankers.  Poor bank staff have taken abuse for five years from the public.

We can consider the grandstanding that will come with a proper bank inquiry but people are demanding justice, although they do not want heads on a platter.

The matter is difficult and extremely complex, and any practical solution could have unforeseen consequences for the liquidity and solvency of our banks, and as a result, for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Everybody in this House is correctly concerned about the issue and it is right for every Member to become involved in the debate and propose what is considered to be a fair solution to the problem.  We are all concerned by the worry and hardship brought on by the inability to repay mortgages for decent, hard-working families throughout the country.  In all our constituencies we continue to come across on a weekly basis families who are in fear of losing their home.  I have known about this only too well in my constituency in the past week or two.<\/p><p>  We would all like a simple and straightforward way of dealing with this tough societal issue but, unfortunately, despite the best efforts of all experts, this has not been possible because of the consequences any action would have on society as a whole.  The resolution of the mortgage crisis would be beneficial to society in general but it must be remembered that debt forgiveness or restructuring must be paid for by somebody else, or the taxpayer in this case.  Despite the significant number of families in mortgage arrears, we must also remember that there is a large number of mortgage holders in our society who are barely coping with repayments.  Their efforts to keep on top of mortgages have become more difficult over the last number of years because of the imposition of necessary new taxes to solve our national deficit problem.  If measures to resolve our mortgage problems necessitated an extra burden on the citizen who is barely coping at the moment, the so-called solution could make matters worse, so we must be careful about any measures taken involving debt forgiveness, as the cost of debt restructuring must be paid for by somebody else.  This would come about either through increased taxation or higher bank charges and interest, which could put many people into difficulty, so we must accept there will be no quick solution.<\/p><p>  Having said this, the Government is not happy with the way many banks are responding to Government policy and Central Bank directions.  The recent intervention of the troika, setting new targets for banks for next March, is to be welcomed.  One of the key problems with the Bill currently being debated is that it has no regard for the potential for moral hazard or strategic defaulting on the part of a debtor.  There is also the real possibility that permitting an infringement of property rights of secured creditors, as proposed in the Bill, would be in breach of the Constitution.  Any changes which could set a precedent for future alterations would undermine our credibility and have a knock-on effect on foreign direct investment.<\/p><p>  We in the House must continue to focus on these very serious issues in a careful and considered way.

Everybody must come together to engage with banks and try to achieve a solution; it is incumbent on everybody involved in this to engage because without such engagement, the process will go nowhere.<\/p><p>  For the vast majority of taxpayers who finance the banks, those institutions must provide viable solutions to maintain family homes.

With this, a person who can only afford to pay interest on the principal would have the amount calculated relative to what he or she can afford.  The balance would be parked and dealt with down the road but debt would not be crystallised and nobody would be evicted from a home.  This would be based on the principle of the there Fs of fixture of tenure, fair rent and freedom to sell.  Sometimes solutions come in many guises.<\/p><p>  I do not like the manner in which the proposed legislation would leave the debtor's representative with the choice of what should be paid, as the creditor must have a say in the process.  When we speak of debt, we must remember the core and non-core debt of businesses.  We cannot just exclusively speak of people with mortgages, as people in business have an iron in the fire, employing many people while being burdened with much debt.  We must examine the non-core aspects, which are like an anchor sinking viable businesses.<\/p><p>  Many people here are looking to a short-term solution but the solution has to be long term and viable.  Looking at a debtor book in business, each separate person is dealt with differently, with different rates of interest charged based on past performance.  This process must work in much the same way.  When people talk about a future bailout, people must engage and if money is required in future, it should go to those who engaged in the first place.  I disagree with the idea of handing money straight to the banks; it has to go to provide solutions.  Nobody wants to see a family home go.  Many second homes need to be repossessed as they are holding down the market.  Nevertheless, many people have taken to the notion that they will not pay anything.  People must pay a mortgage or rent as there is a duty to pay something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200054#CCC00300","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1380733800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>We would be hard pushed to find somebody in the country who does not know some or many of the hundreds of thousands of families in serious mortgage crisis.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, last night indicated that one of the main priorities of the Government has been to put in place some of the best possible solutions for people living under the burden of unsustainable debt.  With the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, we now finally have an insolvency regime to address the needs of our Irish population.  The range of measures available through the ISI have been designed to provide quality insolvency solutions to debtors in a very important, transparent and customer-focused manner that is fair to all.  It is in everybody's interest, including borrowers, lenders and society as a whole, to ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are put in place to facilitate this development, with timely provision of appropriate and sustainable resolutions for borrowers facing or experiencing mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>  I agree that restructuring arrangements agreed to date have primarily been of a short-term nature, with interest-only or even less than interest-only arrangements accounting for 46% of restructuring processes.  As of end of December 2012, there were over 106,000 mortgage accounts in arrears for which no restructured arrangement had been put in place.  With this Government there is a clear priority to deliver an effective regulatory and consumer protection framework that would be in the best interests of borrowers, lenders and the wider economy.  We all recognise that the process has started, although it is slow.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that the Bill before us makes no acknowledgement of the Personal Insolvency Act or any of the other strategic steps taken to address the mortgage arrears problem.  Along with that Act we have the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Central Bank revised code of conduct on mortgages and the Land and Conveyancing Act.  This Government's strategy is to assist people and families in mortgage distress, with four distinct measures in the form of the personal insolvency process, the mortgage advisory service, the mortgage to rent scheme and proactive engagement with banks.<\/p><p>  I will refer to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which stipulates that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases, aiming to assist the borrower in genuine difficulty rather than procrastinating or avoiding the problem.  They should genuinely assist, in as much as possible, having regard to the special circumstances in families.  In particular, the code provides that the lenders' arrears support units must base assessments of the borrowers' cases on the full circumstances, including personal circumstances, overall indebtedness, information in the standard financial statement, current repayment capacity and previous history.  Form should be taken into account.<\/p><p>  This revised code provides robust protection to consumers in mortgage difficulty and is vital in solving mortgage difficulties faced by too many families.  The Personal Insolvency Act provides for the introduction of three new debt resolution processes, which although requiring court approval are essential non-judicial procedures.<\/p><p>Based on my constituency experience in working with people for the past year who are in major financial distress, we are beginning to see long-term sustainable solutions being put forward for them.  I agree that it has taken too long to get here, but people are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  Lorcan O'Connor fills me with hope that there will be a resolution in the short to medium term for the 106,000 families in arrears.  In the United Kingdom 65% write-downs are the norm for its insolvency service given the number of people in debt.  This is to be welcomed and I am confident that the ISI will be able to do the same for people here to enable them to rebuild their lives which have been shattered in the past few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200054#CCC00400","speaker":"1075","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380734400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Shattered by Shatter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200055#DDD00200","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1380734400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Catherine Murphy, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, Seamus Healy and Mattie McGrath.<\/p><p>  T&aacute; fhios agam go raibh an &aacute;bhar seo a phl&eacute; an seactain seo caite ach t&aacute; s&eacute; tabhacthacht go bhfuil s&eacute; &aacute; phl&eacute; againn anocht agus ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabharirt faoi Deputy Collins de r&eacute;ir an obair a dh&eacute;an s&iacute; i gc&oacute;mhair an Bille.<\/p><p>  I read over material I had gathered on mortgages and was struck by the important principles put together by the various researchers and groups campaigning on mortgage issues.  The people concerned have a strong track record on anti-poverty issues, including debt, credit and housing.  The first principle to accept is that there is an inability to pay rather than an unwillingness to do so, which means that there is a need for a multidimensional response.  We are all flawed human beings and human nature being what it is, some people will choose not to pay, not because they cannot but because they will not.  That leads me to the second principle - the need for data.  All policy initiatives must be undertaken consistent with reliable and accurate data, some of which have been missing.  The solutions must take all debt liabilities into account, otherwise they will not be workable.  Debt write-off does not sit easily with some people, but if mortgage holders have been paying honestly and trying to do their best, the point can be reached where the practical and common-sense approach is to write off the debt.<\/p><p>  Another principle is that debtors need adequate representation in negotiations and that the cost should not be prohibitive.  People also need to have a minimum income.  They must be able to meet their basic needs while repaying their debt.  The aim should be to keep them in their homes, whether as an ongoing mortgage holder or as a tenant.  When we discussed this issue two weeks ago, the Fianna F&aacute;il motion referred to keeping people in their homes and stated that where repossession occurred, appropriate social housing and social welfare rights should be provided.  It further stated the mortgage arrears crisis represented the greatest social challenge facing the State.  I disagree because we must examine housing generally.  In the area I represent there is a dire shortage of housing, whether it is social housing, private rented accommodation or local authority housing.  This issue must be also included, with mortgage distress, when the housing crisis is considered.  Everything must be done to ensure people remain in their homes and that they are not added to lengthy housing waiting lists.<\/p><p>  The other principle is that the personal insolvency process should be adequately transparent.  The Bill is trying to address provisions not adequately covered in a PIA.  There is a specific proposal for a mortgage debt arrangement which would be added to the provisions in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  It tries to regulate the relationship between the debtor, the bank and the PIP.  The legislation addresses the issue of a reasonable standard of living and acknowledges that families need discretionary spending.  They spend the most and if we can get them spending again, that will be a boost to the economy.  If the measures brought forward to date were working, we would see the results in the statistics, but we are seeing the opposite.  More than 97,000 mortgages, with a total value of &euro;18.6 billion, are in arrears for more than 90 days.<\/p><p>  This legislation tries to ensure owner-occupiers are protected.  People have genuine fears that the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 was designed for business people and those with multiple properties, but the rationale behind this Bill is that it will force the banks to deal with homeowner debt.  It is terrible that it is assumed that all those in mortgage distress are strategic defaulters.  That is a serious mistake, but it is determining the policies being introduced.  The Government has bailed out the banks at enormous expense and they have to play their part through genuine realistic engagement with those in distress.  This legislation might force them to do that and deal with homeowners.  As we debate parliamentary democracy with the Seanad referendum approaching on Friday, it would be useful if it was accepted that there was wisdom and an insight on all sides of the House and that it was not confined to the Government benches.  The Government might just acknowledge that there was such wisdom and an insight in the case of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200055#DDD00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1380734400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the Bill and strongly commend Deputy Joan Collins for bringing it forward to help people in genuine crisis.  This demonstrates that members of the Technical Group have ideas, solutions, common sense and, above all, that we have a great sense of justice on behalf of the people.<\/p><p>  The Government must realise there is a major problem with families under huge financial stress who need our help.  They need reasonable solutions and action now.  The Taoiseach stated in the House earlier and again yesterday that 12.7% of mortgage holders were in arrears, but those who live and work in the real world believe the accurate figure is approximately 25%.  A total of 86% of families in distress have nothing left at the end of the month, while the remaining families who pay their mortgages on time each month and are good citizens are left with practically nothing.  That issue has to be addressed in this debate.  The vast majority want to make an effort to pay down their debt.  That is the reality every week in my constituency clinic in Donnycarney.<\/p><p>  Before addressing the legislation, I would like to speak out again on behalf of another group of mortgage holders who were shafted in the past - the residents of Priory Hall.  I commend them for the work they have done.  They were let down by the developer, the State, bureaucracy and the banks.  Many of them are in a dire situation, but I commend people such as Stephanie Meehan who lost her partner, Fiachra Daly, because of this issue which has come alive again because of his sad death and her bravery and integrity.  However, it is important that the Government move on this issue and support the residents of Priory Hall because these families are suffering badly.  They are crying out for justice.  It is a disgrace that they had to wait for someone's death to end their nightmare.  It is time for legislators, the State and everyone else involved to bail them out as a matter or urgency.  We bailed out the banks.  Why are we not bailing out the residents of Priory Hall?  Next Friday the Government will spend &euro;14 million on a referendum, while between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million would address this issue.  I commend Stephanie Meehan for her recent statement and again offer my deepest sympathy to her on the death of her partner, Fiachra.  These families have suffered enough.  This is related to the debate.<\/p><p>  The legislation is based on the Norwegian model and I thank Deputy Joan Collins for the magnificent work she has done on it.  She has come up with ideas, solutions and reasonable, practical outcomes to help families.  The Government parties regularly say the Opposition has no ideas, but this is one of many, which is why people are looking to members of the Technical Group to show leadership on this issue.<\/p><p>  On 21 June this year the Central Bank stated 95,554 or 12.3% of private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses were in arrears for more than 90 days at the end of March 2013, up from 92,349 accounts or 11.9% at the end of December 2012.<\/p><p>The number of principal dwelling house, PDH, accounts in long-term arrears of more than 180 days increased by 4.8%, showing quarter-on-quarter growth.  The number of accounts in arrears more than 720 days was 12%.  The number of PDH accounts in early arrears fell marginally during the first quarter of the year.  The figures show that 46,564 PDH accounts were in arrears of less than 90 days at the end of March, reflecting a quarter-on-quarter decline of 0.7%.<\/p><p> I urge all Members to support this excellent legislation introduced by my colleague, Deputy Joan Collins.  The Bill presents solutions and an option to help families.  We need to do it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200055#DDD00400","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380735000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Joan Collins on the work involved in this Bill and on introducing it to the House.  It is a serious attempt to deal with a very serious issue but what is really good about it is that it has worked elsewhere.  One could ask why we should not consider solutions that have worked elsewhere.<\/p><p>  This week&rsquo;s figures from the Central Bank show the depth of the problem.  Since 2009, when it began to collect quarterly statistics, the percentage of mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days has grown by 17% or 17,000 loans.  That amounts to &euro;18.6 billion.  In total, 100,000 mortgages have entered arrears.  Some of the arrangements for dealing with them are temporary solutions such as, for example, interest-only arrangements or reduced payments where the mortgages are clearly not sustainable.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made on numerous occasions in the House to a power imbalance.  The scale of the figures is frightening.  The Personal Insolvency Act introduced some onerous pathways for people to deal with debt problems and a power imbalance was sewn into the legislation.  This Bill seeks to rebalance the relationship in favour of borrowers in difficulty.  Nobody is suggesting that we embark on wholesale debt forgiveness.  The Bill is strict in terms of the qualifying criteria but that seems to have escaped many speakers on the Government side.  It would be available only one time per mortgage.  The Bill is sensible.  It is designed to tackle this unique crash which does not happen much more than once in a generation.  The situation threatens the national interest.  Not to engage in the exercise is itself a moral hazard.  I am pleased the Bill breaks the power imbalance because that is the key to tackling mortgage arrears in an equitable manner.<\/p><p>  The Bill makes it a requirement that a person should have tried and failed to reach an agreement with the lender in advance of turning to this option.  It means one is setting minimum standards and giving a statutory guarantee to borrowers.  That is a decent principle.  If we take a silo-based approach to mortgage arrears, it would be as if the only cost is to the individual families who are put on the side of the road when in fact there is a cost to the State.  I wish that was factored into the debate.  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan outlined that the significant housing waiting list will become even bigger because people will not be able to borrow again.  They will go on the waiting list and will require rent assistance.  That is not a temporary solution because there is no other solution in most major urban centres.  Because of the poverty trap that is built into the system people will not be able to work and they will then be on social welfare and will be entitled to medical cards, student grants and many other supports.  Such people will find it impossible to get back into the workforce.  Those who are in distressed mortgages had jobs because if they did not they would not have got a mortgage.  The solutions we are offering will make such people permanently unemployed and unemployable because of the lack of real choice.<\/p><p>  We were told recently in the House that for every 10,000 people who come off the live register there is a saving to the State of &euro;90 million.  We must examine the issue in its totality.  Up to now the Government is considering the issue as though it is a problem for individual families and banks.  It is a problem for all of us.  We must begin to consider the issue in a much more rounded way if we are to find solutions that will benefit not just the individuals concerned but society as well.  I urge the Government to give the Bill a serious hearing and the opportunity to go to Committee Stage because it is serious legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200056#EEE00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1380735000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Joan Collins for introducing the Bill.

What Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or other parties do in such cases is to hold a press conference.  Sadly, when people from this group put forward good ideas they get ignored.  One person turned up.  I am disappointed for two reasons.  The first is that the media attends press conferences of organisations that have destroyed this country and will not attend press conferences of people who are trying to make a change.  More importantly, I am surprised they did not turn up because many media organisations have already benefitted from similar write-downs to what Deputy Collins has suggested and that achieve the same result.

I would say people can work it out.  I would have thought they would have come to applaud Deputy Collins and to say that the approach worked for them.  It worked to the extent that the head of one of the companies said the restructuring was a very positive development for the company and put it in a good place to deal with many challenges for the business.  If we went along with what Deputy Collins suggests, average persons having benefited from it could say the restructuring was a very positive development for their house and put them in a good place to deal with many challenges for their families.<\/p><p>  Let us look at the write-down for one of the companies.  I will quote from NAMA Wine Lake because it says it a lot better than me.  It states:<blockquote>But on the face of it, it looks as if the banks may forgive or write-down or write-off up to &euro;196m plus interest or 44c-plus in the euro and are getting 11% of a company which had a market value of &euro;20m.<\/blockquote>In other words, the bank did a deal with a company whereby it wrote off &euro;196 million in debt and it got &euro;2.2 million of a company in return.  Let us, for example, apply those rules to a &euro;200,000 mortgage on a house now worth &euro;100,000, as would be the case in my town.  If the banks decided, as they already have for those big organisations, to give a 44% write-down on such a mortgage, that would bring it down to &euro;112,000.  I did hear a Member suggest that perhaps this Bill would be better if the bank would take equity.  Let us say we would stomach that, which would be hard to do given that the banks caused the problem in the first place.  On the basis of the logic for the media companies, even though it would stick in my craw, it would be better than what some have suggested, because all the bank would get is 11% of one's house for an &euro;80,000 write-down.<\/p><p>It sounds like a good idea but if it is such a good one, why did the employees not turn up to listen to why it could benefit ordinary people too?<\/p><p> I had people in my office approximately six or seven months after I was elected and I obtained figures for them on stress tests.  I was told that in the region of &euro;9 billion was available to help us with write-downs.  Who has that money?  Has it been used to write down the debts of multi-billionaires?  How much of the money is left?  Anyone who would suggest that Deputy Collins's Bill is unrealistic should examine the fact that there is meant to be approximately &euro;9 billion available.  Sadly, all people are not treated the same.<\/p><p> If an ordinary person wants to have his debt written down, the personal insolvency service will publish his name.  It is a bit like &ldquo;Cheers&quot;: the personal insolvency service where everybody knows your name.  I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the details on the sort of debt write-down the banks that we own gave the media organisation and was told the information was commercially sensitive.

It has been tried and tested and has been successful elsewhere.<\/p><p>  I commend Deputy Joe McHugh of Fine Gael, who made a very reasonable and reasoned speech earlier this evening.<\/p><p>  This legislation is necessary because the current insolvency legislation, passed in this House recently and now in operation, is seriously flawed and deficient.  It is seriously flawed because it gave a veto to the banks and seriously deficient because it is now quite clear that a significant number of distressed mortgage holders will not fulfil the criteria in the legislation.  We must simply listen to what Mr. Patrick Honohan said last week.  He said 62% of the sustainable solutions offered by the banks to meet the Central Bank guidelines involved voluntary sale, voluntary surrender or repossession.  Over the weekend, personal insolvency practitioners have confirmed that, in their experience to date, as many as 43% of people coming to them will not be able to avail of the personal insolvency services because they have no disposable income.<\/p><p>  This Bill deals specifically with those two issues.  It will remove the veto from the banks in regard to owner-occupied properties.  We are talking about people who made mortgage repayments when they were in a position to do so.  There are trying to pay now and would love to be able to do so.  We are talking about family homes.<\/p><p>  The second key point of this legislation is that it deals with negative equity pertaining to owner-occupied properties by revaluing the security of the asset at 110% of today's value.  The negative equity will become unsecured debt and this will reduce the mortgage repayments to a more affordable level.  These measures cover the two areas that are causing difficulty for ordinary, decent families who want to pay their mortgages.<\/p><p>  We should remember what Patrick Honohan and others have said.  Mr. Honohan said 62% of the offers by the banks involved voluntary surrender and repossession.  Both of these solutions effectively mean eviction from the family home.  I have seen letters from banks suggesting to distressed mortgage holders that they engage in the voluntary sale of their property.  Did one ever hear the like of it?  There are no mortgages being made available for ordinary people; therefore, there are no sales of properties.  Down the country, certainly in my constituency, it is not possible to sell homes such as the ones in question.  There are no mortgages and people do not have the cash that some investors may have to buy homes in south County Dublin in such places.  We are talking about anything from 40,000 to 60,000 families effectively being evicted.  If this occurs, they will be put on a local authority housing list.  Local authority housing lists already have 98,000 families.

I am saddened, but not surprised, by the response of the Government.  It is a sad indictment of the Government.  I compliment Deputy McHugh and others who have agreed a path with us and who understand the circumstances.  We all know &ndash; we have a small bit of savvy &ndash; what is going on.  We know the banks are controlling everything and about how the bankers, regulator, or the lack of regulators, and politicians and senior public servants allowed the mess to occur.  None of them has been challenged and the ordinary people are left to carry the load.  Every day, especially during the last term, legislation is introduced by the Government to get over the Dunne case, which stopped repossessions.  The Government introduced a Bill with a lovely title, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill.  It should have called it what it was, the eviction Bill.  I have an eviction notice in my hand that a family in Cork received .  It was delivered by the sheriff on 9 September 2013 and pertains to Start Mortgages.  The letter tells the family in question to vacate the property in ten days or else face eviction.  Are we going back to the Peep o' Day Boys and the landlords?  Irish people fought against what they represent.  What more noble idea or dream could working people have than to get married or become involved in a relationship, take out a mortgage, house themselves and live a normal life?  The problems were allowed to continue in a frenzy and regulators laughed.  Those who were challenged, including prime ministers and taoisigh, said the people giving warnings should go away and commit suicide.  What more arrogant and insulting behaviour could the Government engage in than the behaviour that resulted in its having passed the legislation in question?<\/p><p>  The Government also introduced legislation establishing the personal insolvency agency.  It is all window-dressing for the bankers who created the mess, the people whom we bailed out.  I voted for the bailout.  I was warned of the abyss, but how much worse could the abyss have been had we not had a bailout?  We were fooled, tricked and lied to by the banks.  We heard the tapes of the bankers who were laughing and scoffing about how they fooled everyone.<\/p><p>  The referendum on the court of appeal is on Friday, again to allow bankers to put people out of their homes.  Many people in desperation have exhausted all the available court remedies.  They do not get much satisfaction or solace in court.  Many are appealing to the Supreme Court in a last-ditch effort, which is causing a problem for the bankers.  Therefore, the Government has to do something about it, on the instruction of Ms Merkel and co. and the troika.  Here we are, bowed down again, and we hope to get rid of our second Chamber, which might have a bit of sanity.  The legislation is not even being debated and people are sleepwalking into a court of appeal.  There is no detail on how many judges will be appointed, the kind of court it will be and how much money the barristers will charge.  It is all regarded as fine.  It is a question of putting the clock ticking in the belief free legal aid will deal with the fees, or in the belief that the clients, who cannot pay, will pay.  The meters will be ticking for the fat cats to get richer while ordinary people and families are in desperation over the great extent of the crisis.<\/p><p>We can ignore it all we like and we can have the Taoiseach denying it every morning on the Order of Business and during Leader's Questions, but the reality is that it is a time bomb waiting to go off.  We cannot house the families on the housing waiting lists, as Deputy Seamus Healy said.  In my constituency, the waiting list is very long as it is.  Are we going to force all of these people onto those lists?  Are we going to allow young families to be terrorised by sheriffs?  It is shocking that any family would have threatening letters passed on to them and have all of the forces of the State coming down on them.  Thankfully, the good people of Kanturk have rallied around that particular family and have gone to the High Court in an effort to assist them.  They are looking for some mercy, and here we are trying to interfere with the courts by introducing a new court of appeal.<\/p><p> I can see that my time is up.

The Government has taken action across a number of areas, including engagement with the banks, requiring them to develop and apply sustainable measures to assist customers in mortgage arrears, personal insolvency law reform and implementation, and the introduction of mortgage-to-rent schemes and a mortgage advisory function.  Personal insolvency reform and Central Bank involvement are fundamental to resolving the mortgage crisis.  These processes are under way and should be supported.  I wish to stress, in response to several Deputies, that these processes are for all classes of debtor, not for a select few.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Joan Collins for the work she has put into her Bill.  However, I must reiterate what the Minister stated in the House yesterday - that the mortgage restructuring arrangement proposed by the Deputy, to be additional to the three new debt resolution arrangements introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act of 2012, would turn what is a negotiated approach to debt resolution into an adjudicative approach, with the details of such arrangements determined solely by a personal insolvency practitioner, with acceptance by the creditor to be mandatory.  Such an approach would be unconstitutional and would have serious economic and financial implications for the sustainability and solvency of financial institutions, with the risk of a resulting additional burden being placed on taxpayers.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has the power, from both the prudential and consumer protection perspectives, to require banks to address mortgage arrears cases on their books.  It will no longer be acceptable for banks to apply short-term solutions where the position of the borrower has fundamentally changed for the long term.  Durable restructures such as split mortgages or other solutions will have to be applied, having regard to the circumstances of each case.  The Central Bank has put in place the mortgage arrears resolution targets, known as MART, and set out a rolling plan requiring the main banks to propose sustainable solutions to their mortgage arrears customers, with a target of 20% by the end of last June, 50% by the end of the year and 70% by the end of March next year.  There are also first targets for concluded solutions of 15% by the end of this year and 25% by the end of March next year.  The banks have indicated that they exceeded the end of June 20% target for proposed solutions, with a heavy emphasis on potential legal proceedings.  However, as Deputy Shatter has already stated, so-called legal letters cannot be regarded as a sustainable solution to a mortgage problem.  <\/p><p>  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, with which banks must comply, clarifies that repossession of a primary home is a last resort and that legal proceedings may be commenced only where lenders have made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement.  Crucially, the Central Bank has commenced an audit of the end of June returns, with a report expected in November.  The audit will entail an examination and evaluation of the policies, procedures, systems and controls that the banks have implemented to ensure that reported performance is complete, accurate and valid.  It will also include file reviews on a sample of loans reported by the banks as modified sustainable loans.  For this process to work and for banks to be able to provide sustainable solutions to mortgage arrears cases, the borrower will have to co-operate and provide the information necessary to enable the lender to provide such solutions.  Where the borrower does not constructively engage with a lender, and despite full compliance by the lender with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, then there may be no other option for the lender but to commence legal proceedings.  Indeed, the lender may otherwise incur even more losses, with further costs for wider society.  Where efforts to find a mortgage solution have failed or are not viable, unfortunately, in some instances - and I hope very few instances - the ultimate resolution will involve the sale of the property.<\/p><p>  I wish to stress that the mortgage-to-rent solution is available to people who qualify for social housing and who fulfil a number of other criteria.  It is becoming a realistic solution for a certain percentage of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200058#GGG01000","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1380736200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>What percentage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200058#GGG01100","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1380736200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>It is a solution that allows people to stay in their own homes.<\/p><p>  What Deputy Collins and others appear to be proposing is the provision to certain debtors of a capital asset at a low cost or, in some cases, no cost at all.  There is the risk in the Deputy's Bill that a means of evading payment might be provided to debtors who may actually be able to meet their financial obligations.  Our overall focus is on assisting people in genuine difficulty in remaining in their homes where possible.  If reasonable offers are made, I expect they will be broadly accepted by customers.  Should the borrower not be satisfied with a bank's proposal, or if no such proposal is forthcoming, the legal insolvency frameworks are now available to mortgage and other debtors.  In addition, the reformed, more debtor-friendly bankruptcy process is available as the ultimate resolution to an unsustainable debt position.<\/p><p>  Two basis principles underpin the Government's approach to the mortgage problem.  First, co-operating mortgage holders experiencing real difficulty should, where possible, be assisted in remaining in their homes.  Second, any framework for mortgage holders must distinguish between those who cannot afford to pay the mortgage on their primary homes and those who will not pay.<\/p><p>  Providing a fresh start for people facing genuine difficulty in dealing with their mortgage commitments is necessary.  The Government has provided a suite of measures.  We all agree that the banks must offer proper solutions to debtors.  I commend Deputy Collins for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200058#GGG01200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1380736200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Collins and Ross.<\/p><p>  I also commend Deputy Collins for her introduction of this Bill.  It is really important that this issue be kept on the agenda.  If we say nothing, worse can happen.  If people speak up and if the Government puts a bit more pressure on the financial institutions to behave differently, things could get better.  All of the arguments have been made and we have gone around the houses on this issue for the best part of this Parliament's term.  A number of points stand out.  It is not rocket science and there is little doubt that the priorities of the banks are being given preference over those of the citizen.  If that were not true, we would not have given billions to the banks without conditions.  It would have been nice if the last Government had attached some conditions to the bank bailout.  It would have been nice if the Government had said that it would bail out those failed financial institutions, which failed largely due to their own poor management and which should have been allowed to go broke, but only on condition that they then look after everyone else who is in trouble.  Some might say that is very idealistic, but I do not think it is quite so mad.  <\/p><p>  I note that NAMA boasted last week that it got the full 60% back from a builder.  The builder in question owed the State banks &euro;1.5 billion.  NAMA bought that debt at 60%, equating to approximately &euro;950 million, and got its money back when it sold on the assets.  That is fine, and I am sure the builder will trade again.  However, there is actually more than &euro;500 million missing, and that bill is being picked up by the taxpayer.  But everything is grand - sure we are keeping businesses going.  Small and medium-sized businesses in Ireland are in a very difficult place at the moment because, generally speaking, people have very little money in their pockets, and the mortgage crisis is playing a huge role in that regard.  It is challenging for many people to pay their mortgages simply because the mortgages are too big.<\/p><p>More than 1 million people are left with &euro;50 of spending money after they pay their bills each month.  While the Government can claim we have economic growth with the green shoots of recovery emerging, living standards are continuing to drop with people finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.  Mortgage debt is a significant factor in that.<\/p><p> It is okay to rescue the failed financial institutions to the tune of billions of euro.  It is okay to help big businesses to overcome their problems because we need them to provide employment to get the economy going again.  However, the Government seems to believe it does not need the ordinary citizen to be on a good footing.  That is really important as we will never have a real recovery until it happens.<\/p><p> There is talk about moral hazard and that some will take advantage if they are helped out with mortgage repayments.  Do those who do not need help realise they would be better off when those who need help are given it?  We will all be better off when our society, domestic economy and living standards come around and recover from the doldrums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200058#GGG01300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380736800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Joan Collins and Wallace for sharing time with me.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me when he sat down if he convinced the Government.

It is also constructive because it takes the bankers out of the pivotal position in which the Government has put them.  That is what is radical and fundamental about this Bill.  The Bill calls for more weight to be given to borrowers and a little less to bankers.  Why does the Government consistently concede the final say to bankers?  They are the ones who carry an equal, if not greater, responsibility for reckless lending.  The emphasis in the Government&rsquo;s thinking is that it is reckless borrowers who have to pay one way or the other.  If one is going to play the blame game, it should go to the lender at least equally as to the borrower.  However, this does not figure in the Government&rsquo;s thinking because the veto still rests with the banks.<\/p><p>  The noises coming from the Central Bank - and sometimes the Government, as happened with the Taoiseach this morning - are that it is on some sort of collision course with the banks which are running rings around it.
