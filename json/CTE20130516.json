The clerk has been in contact with the HSE who did refer the matter to the Garda when it became clear that public moneys paid to SIPTU were claimed by the union not to have been lodged in an official account.

They were south Dublin county and Galway city and county.  As I indicated last week they had been certified during 2011 and we did not receive a clear explanation for the delays in submitting them.  The process is that the county enterprise boards send their accounts, usually with the annual report on their activities to Enterprise Ireland, which then sends them on to the Department, which then submits them to the Oireachtas.  The practice in some of the county enterprise boards of submitting the two documents together &ndash; the financial statements and the performance report &ndash; is probably the main reason for delays.  As we understand it, Enterprise Ireland received those two sets of financial statements earlier this year, one set in January and one set in April and there has not been too much delay since they were received there in coming to the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600003#B01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1368694800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>No. 5 is our work programme.

There is a huge emphasis in the current climate on enterprise and doing everything we can within communities to help people create jobs, support jobs and job creation.  People would have read in the national media in recent weeks about the most disgusting possible example of the use of the word &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; to create a culture of junketeering, not just for members of a board but also their family relatives.  I refer to the Wicklow Enterprise Park in my constituency which had a board stuffed full of county managers, former county managers, councillors and F&Aacute;S executives.  They certainly like to travel.<\/p> <p>The board spent two nights in Killarney at a cost of &euro;17,000.  Between 2005 and 2007, board members went on US junkets costing between &euro;22,000 and &euro;26,000 and, as much as I love Wicklow, when they visited the Kennedy Space Centre, Universal Studios and Disney World, I am not sure what they thought they would bring back to the county.<\/p><p> This would all be appalling but laughable to a degree if it were not for the fact that it drew down millions in State grants over a sustained period.  It drew down grants from Pobal, F&Aacute;S, Enterprise Ireland and possibly from the Department of Social Protection.  Pobal went in to carry out an audit on its funding and the Pobal chief executive wrote to me to say that he believes a comprehensive, in-depth review is required of all public funding accessed by the company but that such a review significant exceeded Pobal's scope so it wrote to the Department of Social Protection to advise it of that and requested the matter be brought to the attention of all relevant accounting officers and the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p> There is obviously a specific issue concerning this so-called company but there is a broader issue about the checks and balances that were in place when money was doled out under the headings of enterprise, job creation or community support from a variety of State agencies and Departments over a period of time in the early 2000s.  I am interested to know the Comptroller and Auditor General's perspective on this.  Did that request ever arrive from the chief executive of Pobal?  The committee should consider corresponding with the relevant accounting officers because we must be able to have faith in organisations involved in enterprise in our communities.<\/p><p> We do not need to see what we read in the <i>Mail on Sunday<\/i>, whereby people were writing to the University of Texas to beg for a visit and it took the manager of the Austen Technology Incubator to write back and say there is nothing magical about the physical location, it is just a set of run-down offices in a university building.  He said that what was special about was what they did there and how they added value, and that was not observable on a visit.  The F&Aacute;S executive who was on the board said that it does not look good and the letter from Austen makes progress in this area impossible.<\/p><p> This company brought together councillors, managers and F&Aacute;S executives and this was how they treated public funds.  It is a serious issue both for Wicklow and in a much broader sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600003#B01800","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368695400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The letter from Pobal to the Department of Social Protection did not result in a referral to me.  We have no record of receiving any correspondence from the Department.  I only became aware of concerns around Wicklow Enterprise Park when there was a press inquiry asking if an investigation had started in my office on foot of the recommendation from Pobal.<\/p><p>  In a way this case raises some of the concerns we had looking at the SIPTU fund and the proliferation of funding from many sources to grant funded bodies.  If we follow the amount of grant funding down through any particular line, it does not look like a significant amount.  Wicklow Enterprise Park Limited is established as a company and will only come within my remit if over 50% of its income in a year is sourced from public sources.  That is the first thing I would have to establish.  It is something I will examine to see if I have a role to play.<\/p><p>  On the general point about the oversight of grant funded bodies, we made recommendations in the SIPTU report and the committee will have the opportunity to discuss those with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The SIPTU report is listed for hearing and the recommendations about the regime that is in place for oversight of grants will be outlined.  We have also agreed with the Department to engage with it on a process of reviewing the arrangements in place around oversight of grants.  One of the things that must be addressed in that context is understanding how much public funding goes into a grant funded body.

The Appropriation Account records gross expenditure of &euro;1.57 billion in 2011.  Payroll costs and pensions accounted for 86% of expenditure.  At the end of the year, 13,900 Garda members and more than 2,000 full-time equivalent civilian staff were employed.  This results in a ratio of one civilian for every seven sworn members.<\/p><p>  Total payroll costs consisted of slightly more than &euro;1 billion, including &euro;214 million on allowances and &euro;81 million on overtime.  The pay outturn for the year was marginally up on the 2010 level, despite the number of staff reducing by approximately 500 year on year.  Pension payments to retired members of the force in 2011 were more than &euro;307 million.  Spending on pension payments was &euro;61 million lower than originally budgeted because of reduced rates payable to existing pensioners and fewer retirements during 2011 than had been anticipated.<\/p><p>  Supplementary Estimate adjustments were made to all of the Vote subheads in 2011.  The largest increase was an extra &euro;52 million provided for spending on salaries, wages and allowances.  A factor in the increase was additional pay expenditure of &euro;28 million incurred in connection with the State visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama. <\/p><p>  Another spending area where there was a substantial supplementary provision in 2011 was subhead E, communications and other equipment.  The account records a 41% increase in spending compared to 2010, mainly as a result of the outsourcing of road safety speed cameras in November 2010.  This additional expenditure on the Vote was offset by a new category of appropriations-in-aid, namely, receipts of fixed charge penalties.  In the past, the full receipts of fixed charge penalty payments collected by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were paid directly to the Central Fund.  In 2011, the overall receipts amounted to &euro;23.3 million, of which &euro;10.6 million was retained in the Vote as appropriations-in-aid and the balance of &euro;12.7 million was paid into the Central Fund.<\/p><p>  The committee is also considering Chapter 26 which reviews the systems in place for collecting motor tax and monitoring and deterring evasion of the tax.  As previously discussed, a number of bodies play a role in the collection, administration and enforcement of motor tax.  The committee has already examined the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on its role, which is mainly concerned with maintaining the register of vehicles and the collection of motor tax paid online.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has responsibility for motor tax policy and the local government fund, into which the proceeds of the tax are paid. <\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s responsibility is to enforce the requirement that vehicles publicly in use have and display a current motor tax disc.  The main focus of Garda activities in respect of motor tax is to detect cases of failure to display a current disc, levy fixed charge penalties and collect the payments and initiate prosecutions where these charges are not paid on time.  In addition, where a vehicle owner wishes to declare that his or her vehicle was off the road for a period and, therefore, not liable to motor tax, a member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must witness the declaration.  The Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Bill 2013, currently before the Oireachtas, proposes changing to a system whereby such off-the-road declarations are made in advance, rather than the current retrospective declaration.<\/p><p>  The examination found evidence that around 5% of randomly sampled vehicles on the road in 2010 and 2011 did not have a current motor tax disc.  Based on the estimated number of vehicles in use nationally, this suggests that approximately 125,000 vehicles on public roads are untaxed.  The motor tax revenue foregone is estimated at approximately &euro;50 million.  This figure excludes cases where the tax disc is less than a month out of date, which is an allowed grace period.<\/p><p>  The examination included an analysis of approximately 240,000 fixed charge notices issued between 2008 and 2011.  In some cases, multiple penalty notices had been issued to vehicle owners.  The total number of vehicles involved was 185,000.  We found that around 40% of fixed penalty charges had not been paid.  We also found that motor tax had not been paid in respect of some 40,000 vehicles between the date the fixed penalty notice was issued and April 2012.  Of those that had paid tax after the fixed penalty notice issued, 35,000 had made false declarations &ndash; in the presence of a Garda witness &ndash; that the vehicle was not in use at the time the notice was issued.    <\/p><p>  In summary, the results of our analysis are that the fixed penalty notice system has not resulted in changed behaviour in respect of motor tax compliance in a significant number of cases.  The integrity of the off the road declaration system is also seriously undermined when registered vehicle owners, in front of a Garda witness, declare that their vehicle was off the road at a time when it was observed in a public place by another member of the force.  The report, therefore, recommends a formal review of the effectiveness of fixed penalty notices as a deterrent and for better procedures to be devised to ensure the tax is paid when non-compliant owners are detected.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600005#D01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1368696000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McCarthy.

I look forward to discussing any aspect of the Vote with members.<\/p><p>  I will describe the resources available to me in policing this country.  The strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as of 30 April 2013 was 13,330 sworn members, inclusive of all ranks.  In total, since 31 December 2009, 1,218 garda&iacute; of all ranks have retired or left the organisation.  On 30 April 2013, there were 2,052 full-time equivalent civilian staff employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a ratio of civilian to sworn members of 1: 6.5.  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to attaining a lower ratio, this is influenced by the current public sector recruitment moratorium.<\/p> <p>It must also be borne in mind that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs security, intelligence and immigration functions that are not performed by many of our comparator police organisations.  These additional mandates have an impact on the garda-to-civilian ratio.<\/p><p> Following implementation of a district and station rationalisation programme in 2012 and 2013, the structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will comprise a central headquarters, national support units and geographical operational units organised in six regions, 29 divisions, 105 districts and 566 sub-districts.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had much success operationally and organisationally throughout 2012, with decreases in many categories of crime, including reductions, once again, in the numbers of road fatalities and public order incidents.  While 2012 was a challenging year in terms of property crime, we saw a downward trend in the later half of the year, which has continued to date in 2013.<\/p><p> The 2013 budget for the Garda Vote amounts to &euro;1.272 billion, which is a reduction of 4.5% when compared to the final outturn for 2012 of &euro;1.333 billion.  The rapid decline in the public finances in recent years requires us all to do more with less and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not immune from the effects of the downturn in the public finances and we continue to play our part in the nation's economic recovery. <\/p><p> A new strategy statement for the three year period 2013 to 2015 has been published which builds on the achievements of the previous three year strategy statement and takes cognisance of the financial realities ahead, while delivering the necessary financial savings and efficiencies so as to enhance the policing service we provide for members of the public.  The efficient use of resources in the delivery of a professional policing service has been highlighted in the annual Garda policing plan for 2013.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has achieved significant efficiencies in recent times and is undergoing significant organisational development with a number of major change initiatives under way, including a new roster system, the first in almost 40 years in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the new performance and accountability system, PALF. <\/p><p> In conjunction with these achievements, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a significant organisational development and change programme in operation encompassing my commitments towards the Croke Park agreement, the integrated reform delivery plan, IRDP, and the GRACE programme.  This programme has 39 projects either completed or in progress in areas such as a new service delivery model, district and station rationalisation, workforce realignment and an examination of specialisation in the organisation, among others.<\/p><p> Turning to chapter 26 in the 2011 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the collection of motor taxation, the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the administration of motor taxation is to enforce the legal requirement for a vehicle in use to be taxed and display a valid motor tax disc.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues and processes the fixed charge notices in cases of failure to display a current motor tax disc and instigates prosecutions where fixed charges are unpaid.  Motor tax disc display checks are carried out by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during routine operational activities and checkpoints.  A total of 58,075 fixed charge notices relating to tax and registration offences were issued in 2012.  This compared to a figure of 65,863 in 2011, a reduction of 7,788, or 12%.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can detain vehicles under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, as amended by section 19 of the Road Traffic Act 2006, where,<i>inter alia<\/i>, there is no road tax in force for a period of two months or greater.  Regarding a declaration of non-use, the role of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to witness the signed declaration of non-use by the vehicle owner.  I fully support the measures included in the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Bill 2013 whereby off-road declarations will be required to be made prospectively.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to address the committee.  I will answer whatever questions the Chairman and members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600005#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368696600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Callinan.

As of now, I understand three garda&iacute; face disciplinary proceedings over the quashing of penalty points, that is, three out of the 113 officers involved.  The assistant commissioner has found no evidence of criminality, corruption, deception or falsification and that an average of 10,702 notices were terminated every year by garda&iacute; employing discretionary power.  He has found that notices were terminated for a good reason in many cases but for no good reasons in others.  When people look at this issue, they will come to the conclusion that there is less to this issue than meets the eye.  It has probably been overblown in some ways.  However, we must ask questions about basic administration and administrative procedures in the context of completing files and the audit procedures involved when a quashing of a notice occurs.  Is the Commissioner concerned that basic procedures have not been followed in some districts and divisions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600006#E00400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368696600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  With the Chairman's permission, I would like, first, to outline the three main pillars under which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates, which are to be found in our corporate strategy and annual policing plans.  Our mission statement refers to working with communities to protect and serve them and to having excellent people delivering policing excellence.  The third pillar is something which will be very familiar to all members, namely, our national emblem of the harp.  We use the acronym HARP to remind our members that they are charged with the responsibility of enforcing the laws of this land and protecting communities and businesses, in the widest sense.  It stands for honesty, accountability, respect and professionalism.  Keeping these four values in mind pretty much takes care of the mission statement and the vision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  The Deputy has raised an extremely important issue for us, that is, the enforcement of road traffic legislation and the powers of discretion that arise in that context.  As I see it, there are two issues involved.  One is the actual processes, procedures and policy involved and compliance with them.  The second is discretion.  Depending on which lens one uses to look at some of these decisions, one would have a particular view.  I can guarantee the committee that if all of us in this room took ten cases, we would probably come up with ten different views of how to process a particular instance.  What the administration of the system - the on-the-spot fines system - is all about is applying balance, equality and non-discrimination.  It is also about fair procedures and good practice.  <\/p><p>  I acknowledge the report from the assistant commissioner, Mr. John O'Mahony, and thank him for his assistance, through that very detailed report, in establishing the facts surrounding the allegations in this case.  It is very clear from the report that the assistant commissioner did not see any criminality <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the documents available to him and he studied many of them.  He did not see any fraudulent use of the system; nor did he find corruption or malpractice.  However, what he did find which is of particular concern to me was non-compliance, or rather, not full compliance with the policies and procedures in place.  In that context, he has made a number of recommendations to me which I fully intend to implement.<\/p> <p>I am sure the Deputy is aware that there is also the report I tasked the professional standards unit to produce, in which it, in turn, makes a number of recommendations and some of them cross, as one would naturally expect.  On top of this, I am aware of the Minister's statement yesterday when he spoke about the need for the inspectorate to examine these proposals and see if perhaps it might have anything to add and validate, I hope, the recommendations we are making in an effort to strengthen the process and provide the reassurance that is so necessary to satisfy the public that it is not about whom one knows or what one knows but about fair procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368697200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>One of the main criticisms is of senior garda&iacute; investigating senior garda&iacute;, which is a canard.

He picked a team to look at this very disturbing level of allegations made, who are experienced in their own right - experienced investigators.  I am very satisfied that he and his team will leave no stone unturned in digging out issues around criminality or beyond if they find them.  It should not escape anyone's notice that, like myself, he has done this in the past.  Unfortunately, we have had reason to investigate some of our own people for very serious matters.  We have brought some of our members before the courts in that respect and some of them have received custodial sentences.  It is a question of the people around the investigation wearing the t-shirt and walking the walk at the same time.  They are not afraid to take on any issue presented to them, be it on a criminal or procedural basis.  That, I suggest, is what Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony's report reflects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368697200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I have one more question on this issue and will leave it at that, as other members might want to bring up the issue.

It is the case that when one is dealing with a discretionary issue, it is extremely hard to be absolutely either prescriptive or descriptive in legislating because people meet individual circumstances and have to deal with them as best they see fit using their professional judgment.  I have seen some of the product of the assistant commissioner's report and would not be entirely happy with some of the judgments made.  Nonetheless, the people who made these judgements made them for the reasons they made them, which is an entitlement.  What I can do now is reinforce the need to be very careful when one is dealing with these issues and ensure they are being done for all the right reasons.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the need to keep documentation which, of course, is vitally important.  There is criticism in the report that this did not happen in a number of cases and, of course, there are a number of people subject to a disciplinary investigation.  That has to be dealt with, of course.  We need greater oversight of the process and generally a tightening of the procedures in place.  What I have done in the interim and during the currency of the assistant commissioner's report is send a directive to all of the officers involved at a level where they are in a position to cancel notices to impress on them the need to adhere to the policies in place and to inform them that there will be a further recommendation coming down the road.  I have appointed an assistant commissioner and a small team to ensure implementation and monitoring of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368697200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I will move on but stay in the realm of discretion.

Prior to that we had a slightly different system.  The CHIS system is the process by which we now handle informants.  It is very clear what the requirements are in relation to the handling of informants.  It has to be said these are extremely difficult people to handle because to have a very effective informant, they have to be quite close to the bone.  Therefore, our agent handlers who are all trained in these matters have to walk a very fine line, but the rules of engagement are very clear.<\/p><p>  No more than the other topic the Deputy was discussing earlier with me, there is a need to have contact logs with the people concerned.  They are told at the outset that under no circumstances can they become involved in criminality.  That is a given.  It is also the case that we do not use participating informants in this country.  I would expect that if a situation were to arise or develop where we did need to introduce an element of participation, it would be a matter of deferring to the Director of Public Prosecutions who would decide on its appropriateness or otherwise.  However, we do not give <i>carte blanche<\/i> to anyone to commit crime; I had very fixed views in relation to it.  I am trying not to get involved in specific cases.<\/p><p>  It is the case that a report is in the public domain.  It is the case that there were very heavy criticisms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the manner in which it approached the investigation.

That is the first point.<\/p> <p> For some time now we have been engaged with the ombudsman commission on how we can safely pass on that type of information and how it would be handled in the context of its obligations under section 103 of the Act to report back to the complainant or otherwise of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The ombudsman commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have clear statutory roles.  The issue is how we can both manage to successfully do our business while providing the type of reassurance necessary to ensure people are not killed on our streets because of leaked information.  We have a clear duty of care in terms of how we process such information.  It is somewhat ironic that part of the discussion closed off in the week of publication of the material concerned.

The Deputy has figures indicating that approximately 78% of fixed charge notices had been paid, with motor tax being paid subsequently.  I have not gone into these figures but I assume that at some point, if the fixed charge notice connected to the vehicle is correct in the first instance, the vehicle would not have been taxed.

At the moment a person can walk into a Garda station and get his or her signature witnessed that his or her car was off the road and thereby avoid having to pay arrears for motor tax.  If and when the Bill becomes law, a person will be able to make a declaration directly, not involving the Garda or any other mechanism, if he or she wishes to keep his or her car off the road.  There could be reasons such as travelling abroad, illness, or the car needing to go in for repair, or it may be a vintage vehicle that is not used very often.  There could be dozens of reasons a person wants to keep a car off the road.  As long as a person gives that notification in advance he or she will not be liable for arrears.<\/p><p>  If a person does not give that notice in advance and presents to pay tax, the facility to go into a Garda station will be gone so that person will have to pay the arrears.  There will be no question of not paying arrears if the person has avoided paying the tax and avoided making a declaration that the car would be off the road.  Should a person be caught having made a declaration that his or her car would be off the road and it is subsequently found to be on the road, that will be a new offence.  In addition to driving the car without tax, he or she would be liable for a separate penalty.<\/p><p>  A person who has made an off-road declaration but decides to put the car back on the road within the period of the declaration, which could be up to a year, will be able to tax the car immediately.  There would be no difficulty with the person paying his or her tax and putting the car back on the road.  He or she would pay the tax from the start of the current month and would not be liable for arrears because of having made an off-road declaration, as required.  That is the system, in essence, and it excludes the Garda from the process and reduces the opportunity for people to evade paying their tax.

The members of the commission have indicated that they are not pursuing the issue of discipline and, therefore, they moved towards the position we now find ourselves in with me responding to basically what are in essence allegations that we somehow or other prevented them from doing their business much more quickly than they did.  That is in essence where we are when one breaks it all down.  I have a difference of opinion in that context but I assure the Deputy - I have said this already and I do not mind going back on the record - that I absolutely subscribe to the view that the GSOC is a body with statutory powers that is entitled to see all the information and intelligence we have, sensitive and otherwise.  I have made this clear to the chairman of the commission on many occasions.  The issue is not whether the commission should or should not see the documentation; it is how that information is handled in the context of its responsibilities.  I have huge responsibilities in this area, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates.  I also have the reputation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to defend and uphold in the context of the other security services that we engage with both in Europe and beyond.  There are strict rules of engagement applying to the release of information and documents that are passed on from one jurisdiction to another and I must be careful how I approach these issues.<\/p><p>  There is no dispute with us there but I am not rubbishing the report.  The negotiations and the differences of opinion that we had as to how we should transact our business in this sensitive area were somewhat protracted.  There is no issue there but, equally, there is no issue that whatever needed to be shared was shared.  The commission has a view that it should been shared much earlier and so on but it would not serve the public for me to be involved in a spat with another statutory agency.  My clear view in public and private has been that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must assist the GSOC with its inquiries and investigations.  My colleagues are well aware of my views on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368699600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The Commissioner is in a spat, whether he likes it or not.

On the security side, this year alone, we have 20 people or so, before the Special Criminal Court charged with very serious offences.  None of these things come about by driving around in patrol cars and getting lucky.  That does not happen.  That is evidence of just how effective the use of the intelligence system is.

It is the case that the allegations that were sent to me by the Department were anonymous.  We did not know who had made them.  That remained the position right up until some time in December, several weeks after the investigation had commenced.<\/p><p>  An incident arose in the Cavan-Monaghan division whereby one of those who were involved in this was in the station and was confronted by a sergeant.  This man was printing PULSE documents off the computer and he was asked what he was doing.  He indicated that he was printing information off the PULSE system to hand over to a political representative.  He was confronted on that and told he should not be doing it.  A discussion took place and it would not be appropriate to go into that.  Resulting from that, he indicated that he and another person were providing information to a politician with regard to the penalty points system.  The result of that was that I took advice, from both the Data Protection Commissioner and the Attorney General's office, and I issued a direction.  That is well publicised.  Unfortunately - but there you go - all of this has been out in the public domain.  I was somehow or other perceived as having put a gagging order on these persons.  In among the directions I sent down to the local command was one to ask these persons, if they had any information at all, that they provide that information to Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney, who was then investigating these allegations that are in the public domain, and, in addition, if they had any documents that they had obtained from the Garda PULSE system, that they hand them over.  They should not have those documents in their possession.  That is when we became aware of those persons, and those are the facts of the situation.  We did not become aware when these allegations manifested themselves in the first instance.<\/p><p>  Nothing of a criminal nature, as we now know, has been found by the assistant commissioner or his team.  Therefore, there was no need to approach the Director of Public Prosecutions for a view or a direction on this matter.  Had that been the case, the examination may have taken a different direction and there might then have been a necessity to go elsewhere.<\/p><p>  It is very clear from the report - this is an important point of which sight should not be lost - that the persons who were making those allegations did not have all of the information available to them, and one will have seen evidence of that throughout the report - for instance, where allegations were made about those involved in fatal traffic accidents.  All of that is laid bare in the report.  There are many inaccuracies.<\/p><p>  The other point Deputy Ross raised was the issue of discretion.  We have spoken about this <i>ad nauseam<\/i>.  One either accepts or does not accept that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is entitled to have discretion.  In certain cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has delegated his functions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to certain summary matters and is happy to do that, provides for a level of discretion.  As I stated earlier, how that discretion is used is key to all of this.  People will have a view as to whether that is a proper space to be in, but that is the reality.  My personal view is that I am a strong supporter of discretion.  It is a good thing to have in place, provided it is used correctly.  Without going over old ground, trying to be descriptive or prescriptive in terms of anything I can put out there to help my members towards that end is difficult beyond issuing guidelines that talk about first principles, non-discrimination, equality and practical application in dealing with a particular circumstance.  I think we would all have to agree that if a person is bringing a sick child to hospital or the tax on a car is out by a month in the case of a person who is unemployed or has lost his business, and for whom matters are absolutely going the wrong way, or whatever the situation is that confronts my members on the ground, they should have the power to deal with these matters in a humane way that is balanced and fair.  I am certainly not saying, where there are matters of such a serious nature that action is required to be taken, that we should pull back from doing our job and let others decide.  Where there are less serious offences of a summary nature coming to our attention, it is very important that the discretionary facility, based entirely on the circumstances of the case and with those principles that I have mentioned in play, continues in the future.  It has served the citizens of our country very well in the past.  With the proper use of that discretion, it will continue to be of service to the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600013#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368700800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>\"Proper use\" is the key phrase the Commissioner used.

It would be a regressive step if we got to the point where the only people capable of implementing discretion in our country in respect of these issues were the judges and the only way of dealing with matters of discretion would be to go to court.  The issue concerns how we track that discretion and its visibility and accountability.  The incentives for the witnesses over there were to produce a report that laid out the facts in respect of the penalty points issue.  It is my judgement that this has been done.  It is up to other people to decide what they do with those facts.<\/p><p>  The two main issues I wish to focus on are the Garda roster, which was the subject of much discussion in previous hearings, and motor tax.

I had a full and frank discussion with all the associations because I was aware there are young members who are obviously struggling hard with the conditions and the circumstances they find themselves in.<\/p> <p>This was real problem for all of us.  I called in all of the associations and told them where my position lay and set out the roles and responsibilities I had.  Certainly, that did not include my shouting in public about how the Government should conduct its business.  I had wider responsibilities towards the organisation in terms of fighting for better conditions, equipment, transport, necessary promotions and all of those things I felt I should be addressing.  I have been very proactive on all of those fronts.  After that, we had a series of annual associations and conferences and, again, I spoke to the membership in closed session and we had a very full and frank discussion.  Since then, there has been a much clearer understanding of my role and what I can do to help out.  I indicated that I had been working away behind the scenes and that the people who needed to know about the problems the membership were bringing to my table had been informed and were actually listening.  We can see the manifestation of a lot of those things right now in the context of the LRC proposals.<\/p><p> I was asked if I believe all of this will work.  I hope it will because it has certainly been the case - as they have, with justification, indicated - that the associations were not centrally involved.  That is a huge area which is acknowledged by all reasonable-minded people.  Now, they have had an opportunity to get up-front and central with the people calling the shots and making recommendations back to Government.  I am very pleased that all of the associations fully engaged with the process and are going back to their members to look for an endorsement of proposals that are set to match and meet our obligations towards reaching the savings.  On a personal note, I consider the proposals to be positive and doable.  They will in so far as they possibly can satisfy the membership, but that is a matter for the membership about which I cannot do anything.  The process has certainly paved the way for a more meaningful discussion between the associations and their memberships.

Mr. Callinan stated the individuals concerned were not interviewed in the course of the independent inquiry because of an issue of anonymity.  I do not know whether it was by accident or design, but I presume it was accidental.  What occurred gave an entirely wrong impression of the sequence of events because, as far back as March, the two officers concerned in good faith went through the appropriate procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in making a disclosure.  They saw no response from the Commissioner and - I can only surmise - as a result of concern or frustration, they felt they had to bring these matters into the public domain.  Of course, as we now know, that is what triggered the public discussion and the inquiry into these matters.  I really do not believe it is fair at a meeting of the committee or elsewhere to suggest the two individuals in question acted in any way other than entirely properly and honourably and in good faith.

That is my clear position.  What I am saying is that if one has an issue, one should report it before going on the PULSE system, trawling records, pulling them off and handing them over.  Let us face it: we all have responsibilities when we see wrongdoing.  Every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is obligated to report any form of wrongdoing through the relevant channels or deal with it in whatever way he or she believes is best.

There is an issue.  If one goes back to the start of this process, the Garda vetting unit grew from a very small cadre of people based here in Dublin in the criminal records office and it happened around the time of decentralisation.  The vetting unit was born.  Efforts were made to increase numbers, but there were difficulties similar to those in which we now find ourselves.  The superintendent in charge of the unit put in place a system whereby organisations, authorised signatories, could verify a list of people.  For example, in the teaching profession, authorised signatories provided volumes of people who needed to be vetted such as teachers and career guidance counsellors.  The basic criterion was that anyone who had contact with children or vulnerable adults was listed.  That was purely a quality control issue and put in place in order that as best we could no one would usurp the system and claim, for example, to be Martin Callinan and ask for a clean bill of health.  That system works to a degree with limited resources.  As more and more people began to feed into the system and with the introduction of the legislation coming down the line and the need perhaps to share soft intelligence, this is becoming problematic for us.

Of these cases, 2,595 were occupational injuries with an average settlement of only &euro;64, which we can discount, as these are very small.  The ones I am most interested in are the &euro;2.6 million paid out following car accidents to 373 people and the &euro;6.2 million paid out to 234 civilians who took actions against the State following actions of the Garda, as well as people receiving moneys for accidents in Garda stations.  In the year in question, 241 garda&iacute; rightly received payments under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Compensation Act, which came to &euro;9.756 million, an average of &euro;40,484 to each recipient.  There is a note in the report that at the end of the year 1,160 of these cases were still outstanding.  At a clearance rate of 241 per annum, it will take five years to clear this backlog, and it will bring the final figure to &euro;50 million.  When a garda is injured, why will it take up to five years to receive compensation?  I accept some of the cases in question may be in the courts, but, in fairness to the force&rsquo;s employees, most employers would try and get it expedited as far as possible.  From the figures, it appears that almost 10% of the force have cases pending that have been put on the long finger.  These members are still working while waiting years to be compensated.  This is unfair on the individual garda.<\/p><p>  How much of these figures are due on legal fees?  Would it be a third?

I realise I am pointing to crude statistics, but there is huge concern among the general public about the slow pace of some of the investigations into the banking industry and the things which went awry in it.

I would like to put one or two questions to Mr. Enright of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The question of off-road declarations has been well covered at this stage.  The local government fund is relevant in this regard because car tax receipts go into it before they are allocated to the various councils throughout the country.  There is a significant discrepancy between the amount of money that is given to each county on a <i>per capita<\/i> basis.  That is understandable because a county like Leitrim will need a great deal more support per head of population than the counties in the Dublin region.  South Dublin County Council receives the lowest <i>per capita<\/i> payment.  This has been a matter of ongoing dispute between the council and those responsible for the local government fund.  The most comparable county council is Fingal County Council, which received over &euro;3 million more than South Dublin County Council when the 2012 allocation was made.  The manner in which these decisions are arrived at is a source of frustration for those of us who study these issues.  I can understand why the counties in the Dublin region receive much smaller <i>per capita<\/i> payments than some of the smaller rural counties.  Given that there is a heavy demand for these moneys in the South Dublin County Council area, it is really frustrating that we always seem to come out worse than similar counties when these decisions are made.  Like many other areas, our commercial base has been seriously undermined in recent years because of the economic downturn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013051600026#Z00800","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368708600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>An equalisation model has been used over the years for the purposes of making local government fund allocations to local authorities.

The principle of equalisation has continued to be used for general purpose grant allocations since 2008.  As the equalisation process continues, the amount is consolidated into the baseline so that the changes made are continued through in future years.  This means local authorities will gradually move towards a position of greater equity in the amount of money they have.

On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to welcome Mr. Colm O'Gorman, executive director, and Ms Iverna McGowan, policy and strategy co-ordinator, from Amnesty International.  As everyone is aware, Ireland has a proud record of advancing human rights internationally.  At the beginning of Ireland's Presidency, Amnesty International submitted recommendations in this area.

We have circulated copies of these comments and of the recommendations to members.  As the committee will be aware, we met the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the launch of these recommendations in January.  The T&aacute;naiste welcomed them and noted the Presidency's firm commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in Ireland, Europe and globally.  I am happy to state that we have had a great deal of engagement with several Ministers and key officials to date.  We take this opportunity to indicate our gratitude in respect of debriefing sessions we have been able to have with the Irish Permanent Representative to the EU.  Those sessions have been extremely useful during the Presidency thus far.<\/p><p>  Our specific recommendations, contained in our mid-term review, covered a range of issues including the implementation of the EU action plan on human rights and democracy, the fair treatment of migrants and asylum seekers, Roma rights, corporate accountability, violence against women, fighting discrimination, the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and criminal justice in the EU.  Our priority issues for the Presidency have been violence against women and Roma issues.  Copies of our recommendations and the mid-term review we published have been circulated to members for their attention.<\/p><p>  As we passed the halfway point of the Presidency, we noted some important progress that had been made, including the role Ireland is playing at the United Nations Human Rights Council and the prioritisation by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, of the protection of fundamental rights and the rule of law in Europe during Ireland's Presidency.  Unfortunately, however, there are two areas in respect of which we felt the Presidency might have been stronger.  To date, there has been the regrettable lack of engagement on EU action to combat female genital mutilation, FGM.  We were very heartened, however, by the T&aacute;naiste's comments in Brussels last month to the effect that this issue is now on the Presidency's agenda and will be brought forward.  We hope this commitment will translate to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, placing an item on the agenda for the upcoming Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in June.  In our view, this would confirm the presidency's support for the European Commission's initiative of a consultation on EU action to end FGM.  The Commission is very clear in its desire to move this matter forward and we are of the opinion that it is incredibly important that the Presidency should make a clear statement on and take action to support that intention.<\/p><p>  On the issue of discrimination against Roma, we hope the important political message in the Irish Presidency's statement on International Roma Day will be matched by action during the remainder of its term.  No discussion on human rights in the EU can credibly take place without serious consideration of the plight of the 12 million Roma people across Europe - 6 million of whom live in the EU - who suffer pervasive and systemic discrimination.  We welcome the invitation extended by the Chairman to Oona Mihalache to attend the plenary session of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, and give an address during the session on '\"A Future for Young Europeans\".  It is very important that the human rights issues faced by Roma be discussed at this event.<\/p><p>  As members will be aware, we came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in February.  We have also asked to come before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I wish to stress why we were so keen to come before this committee in particular.  The Lisbon treaty has increased the role national parliaments play in EU decision-making processes.  Earlier this year we met with the Chairman, Deputy Hannigan, to discuss - among other things - the Irish presidency's role in chairing COSAC.  Together with the European Parliament, the committee plays a vital role in overseeing and scrutinising EU policy.  In particular, it plays a role in strategic planning dialogues with the European Commission.  Amnesty International also engages in discussions around the state of the Union address each year, and last September we forwarded our letter to Commission President Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso on this subject to the committee for its attention.  In his 2012 state of the Union address, President Barroso called for better means of tackling the EU's internal human rights problems.  Members will be aware that the need for a new EU mechanism on human rights was also discussed at the General Affairs Council on 22 April.<\/p><p>  There has been much discussion in Brussels recently about the so-called Copenhagen dilemma, whereby the conditions with which we demand states should comply before accession to the Union during the enlargement process are never spoken of once any state becomes a member of the club.  This constitutes a refusal to analyse human rights issues within the European Union.  In our view there is a need for the European Union to take collective responsibility for this.  The committee has a vital role to play in this regard because it can ensure that debates on these issues take place not only at meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality but also at its own meetings in the context of the need for an EU response in respect of such issues.  Of particular note in this debate has been the Minister for Justice and Equality's prioritisation of protection of fundamental rights and promotion of the rule of law in Europe during Ireland's Presidency.  EU-level political support for such initiatives is vital if the EU is to defend its credibility as an entity founded on respect for human rights.  We were very glad also to have had the opportunity to participate at in the Presidency conference last week on the issue of \"A Europe of Equal Citizens: Equality, Fundamental Rights and the Rule of Law\".<\/p><p>  I wish to make some comments on enlargement, which will be an item on the agenda for the COSAC meeting in June.  We appreciate that the enlargement process has been a key part of the Irish Presidency programme.  We met the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Creighton, and officials from the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the EU to discuss these matters in more detail.  Enlargement negotiations should be engaged with constructively in order to maximise the potential to improve the human rights situation in the countries concerned.  Croatia will accede to the European Union this summer.  While progress has occurred in that country domestically in recent years, further attention will have to be paid to the position there post-accession in order to ensure that victims and their families are provided with access to truth, justice and reparations for human rights violations committed during the 1991 to 1995 war.  With regard to other countries in the Balkans, we are highly concerned about reports that continued impunity for war crimes and failings in domestic accountability could be given less prominence - as currently appears to be the case with Montenegro - during future negotiations.  We will be discussing this further with the relevant officials before the end of the Presidency in order to ensure that the accession process is used to its full potential to deliver human rights change across the Balkans.  We are of the view that it is important that these points should also be raised at the COSAC meeting in June.<\/p> <p> In our Presidency recommendations, we have also included nine cases of people under threat.  The adoption of the EU guidelines on human rights defenders was one of the key outcomes of the Irish Presidency in 2004.  As a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Amnesty International asked the Irish Presidency to ensure the EU's active engagement in these cases.  We have suggested how this might be done in our recommendations.

Before asking my colleagues to contribute, I will make a few comments on the presentation.  We were delighted to receive Mr. O'Gorman's comments on the EU Presidency to date, as well as his thoughts on what we should be doing for the remaining few months of the Presidency.  Mr. O'Gorman is absolutely right concerning the need to talk further about the Copenhagen dilemma.  It would certainly be a concern of many that some of the countries that joined the EU in the last ten years have failed to live up to their commitments.  This is particularly so in the case of LGBT rights in some countries.  I have a question on that matter.  I wonder what Amnesty, as an international organisation is doing within these countries.  It is important to make that point to us and other committees so that we can put pressure on from outside those countries.  However, what is Amnesty International doing within some of these member states, not just on LGBT rights but also other rights that Amnesty International feels are not being respected?<\/p><p>  I wish to inform members of the committee and the Amnesty International representatives that we will be having a session on enlargement at the COSAC plenary session.  We have two speakers so far, one of which is Mr. Valentin Inzko, who is the UN's High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Sarajevo.   The other speaker is Mr. Erwan Fou&eacute;r&eacute; who was the EU's special representative in Macedonia.  He was also the OSCE's representative in Transnistria.  I am sure that both of them will be able to give us very enlightening views on the current state of play regarding enlargement from the Balkans region.  I have no doubt that the suggested questions will be raised by members of this committee, some of whom will be attending that conference.  It may also be appropriate for Amnesty International to invite people from other member states to make these comments through Amnesty's contacts there.  It is nonetheless important that these matters are raised.  Organisations such as Amnesty International are needed to educate the attendees from member states as to what questions they should be raising during that session.<\/p><p>  I now call Senator Leyden who wanted to make a point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600004#C00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1368709800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>First of all, I would like to welcome the former Senator, Colm O'Gorman as well as his colleague, Ms Iverna McGowan.  I served with Mr. O'Gorman for a short time in the Seanad.  It was a short time as far as he was concerned, although I have been there somewhat longer.  He played a very good role in the Seanad in that period and I am sorry that he did not continue.  I congratulate him on his appointment with Amnesty International.  The organisation made a very good choice.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Gorman referred in particular to the plight of the 10 million or 12 million Roma people.  Our former committee Chairman, Deputy Bernard Durkan, commissioned a report of which I was the <i>rapporteur<\/i>.  The report was accepted by the Chairman and adopted by the committee, but I got all the abuse.  I never got more abuse for adopting any report before in my life.  The amount of e-mails I received was absolutely unbelievable, not one of which was positive.  I was even banned from a local pub not too far away from where I live, because I mentioned the Roma and there had been an alleged robbery in a particular location.<\/p><p>  The Roma do not do much for themselves, quite frankly.  Let us be honest, they do not have a good reputation.  They will have to get their own act together and there needs to be a bit more leadership within the Roma community.  I know a lot about them since I undertook work on that report.  They are certainly the most oppressed people in Europe, if not in the world.  Their numbers are enormous and they are an Indian race, not Romanians.  The Romanians are blamed because people equate Roma with Romanians.  I wish Mr. O'Gorman well in his work in that regard but, nevertheless, there is enormous discrimination against the Roma.  Each country has to take action to try to assist them to integrate.  Education is particularly important in this regard.  Some countries in Europe are very negative towards the Roma.  <\/p><p>  I also noted the good point on post-accession monitoring.  In the Council of Europe we have decided to monitor Hungary, which I have voted for, because Hungary has taken particular actions concerning the constitution.  We decided that we would monitor Hungary even though it is well regarded and part of the EU and the Council of Europe.  I wanted to make that point to members who are going to Europe that there should be a form of post-membership monitoring.  Therefore when a country joins the EU, we should not ignore everything it does.  A monitoring group needs to go out there to see that it complies with the highest standards of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600004#C00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1368709800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I will start by asking for some information.

It is a noble cause to integrate the Roma.  I have had a lot of experience of the Roma in Budapest, Hungary.  I am also familiar with some of them here in Ireland.  It is right that they, no more than Travellers, should not be discriminated against.  We have legislation to prevent discrimination against Travellers and the days of throwing a Traveller out of a pub are over.<\/p><p>  Is Mr. O'Gorman aware of the extreme difficulties, even today in Ireland, in attracting Traveller children into the educational system at primary and secondary level, and retaining them there?  I am speaking about schools that are most accommodating, including St. Dominic's in Ballyfermot, where they are trying to provide a wonderful education system for the Labr&eacute; Park Traveller children.  However, the most recent statistics from that school show that the retention rate is slipping because of socio-economic problems on the site and the attitudes of the Traveller community.  The school is extremely worried, although it has the yellow flag for accommodating them.<\/p><p>  The Roma community here has many more additional problems than Travellers.  The State is trying to accommodate them, but is Mr. O'Gorman familiar with the difficulties we are having?  There seems to be an increase in problems, perhaps because of conditions on sites where they are living, as well as the abuse of drugs and alcohol, hopelessness and suicide.  Mr. O'Gorman might give us his opinion on those matters.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Gorman used the term \"human rights defenders\" and he has chosen nine.  How did he pick nine from all the human rights defenders in the world?  I was at the Front Line Defenders event in Dublin City Hall where a Mauritanian was awarded the Front Line Defenders award for exposing slavery in Mauritania.  I get confused about who picks these people.  We have been fighting the human rights issue of Nijinsky in Russia.  In addition, there are others imprisoned in Siberia and elsewhere in Russia but we do not hear them being mentioned.  How, therefore, does the international community decide which ones will be exposed in the headlines?<\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in enacting legislation to outlaw female genital mutilation.  Perhaps we should also be giving leadership on that in Europe.  As a white Irish man speaking to Africans and challenging them on why FGM exists in their communities, I am conscious that it is almost a rite of passage in rural parts of Africa.  Nonetheless, we do not condone it.  I saw children in villages in Sierra Leone recently and it was like their holy communion or confirmation; it was a cultural event involving the whole village.  In Europe, if there are any signs of female genital mutilation being pursued by parents or jujus on behalf of some communities, it has to be outlawed. <\/p> <p>Should we concentrate on demands to outlaw it within the EU as opposed to exerting pressure on countries in Africa to outlaw it there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600004#C00600","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368710400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>The documents given to Mr. O'Gorman were published by the European Commission and are based on its assessment of the national strategies on Roma that have been produced in the various countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368710400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I will answer some of the general questions and then Ms McGowan, who works at our European institutions office and who is based in Brussels full-time, will follow up on the others.<\/p><p>  On the question of our work within member states, we are very active at national level in many of those states.  As a global organisation, we also work on them - both globally and regionally - through our European institutions office.  A priority for us in recent years has been discrimination in the EU context, with a focus on that which relates to Roma people, LGBTI individuals, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.  That has been a strong focus for us in the past number of years and it will continue to be so in the future.  At national level within member states, the organisation works on those issues where they are particularly relevant.  As part of a European and global organisation, we also feed in to the work that is happening in other countries.<\/p><p>  Senator Leyden raised the issue of Roma rights.  He referred to the response the committee received when it adopted an important item of work a number of years ago in respect of which Deputy Durkan took the lead.  That response speaks to the level of prejudice that exists within Irish society towards Roma people and towards members of the Traveller community in general.  When we talk about a group of people in terms of that fact that its members do not help themselves or when we make an entire group responsible for the conduct of members of a particular community, that is discriminatory.  We do not assess Irish people within our society, for obvious reasons, and neither do we assess the position in terms of how certain members of society might operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1368710400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I was trying to explain the reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368710400,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I am very familiar with the reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1368710400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan and I went out of our way to be helpful but all we received in return was abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D00600","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368710400,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  It speaks to the reasons why we have a great deal more work to do in order to challenge that level of prejudice.  However, we must also name it as such.  If we ever decide that we can discuss an entire group or class of people within society as some kind of homogenous entity which, therefore, can be held responsible for everything within that group or class, then perhaps that is where we need to start.  That is all I will say about the matter.<\/p><p>  A couple of comments were made about the fact that, post-accession, we must pay particular attention to what is happening within new member states.  When we refer to discrimination, we are not necessarily talking about new member states but just EU states.  In the context of the Roma issue, we have been pushing for infringement proceedings against both Italy and France with regard to forced evictions and other grave violations against Roma people.  There are very particular issues which arise in the context of Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and some of the newer member states.  However, this problem is not one which comes down to old versus new member states; it is, rather, one which exists at EU level.  In the context of Traveller integration, I would encourage the committee to engage as much as possible with the development of the national Roma strategy and its implementation.  Pavee Point, with which we engage directly, does a great deal of work on Roma rights in Ireland.  If the committee has a particular interest in this matter, I encourage it to bring representatives from Pavee Point before it in order to hear their views on the development and implementation of the national traveller and Roma strategy.<\/p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne answered many of his own questions, particularly when he referred to the reasons why members of certain groups - in this case, Traveller children - find it difficult to remain in education.  It is not just about schools being willing, able or positive with regard to encouraging Traveller participation.  Communities and society need to facilitate this and make it possible.  If conditions in terms of accommodation are so poor and if the socioeconomic experience of families and marginalised groups is so significant, then undoubtedly we are going to see less participation in formal education.<\/p><p>  The Deputy inquired as to how we will pick nine human rights defenders.  The answer is that this will be done with very great difficulty.  Ms McGowan will comment further on that matter.  In any of the work we do, we are often involved with cases in respect of which we believe there is evidence of even greater issues.  This means that if we can resolve issues relating to a particular case, we will also be dealing with more systemic difficulties.  That is one of the ways in which we prioritise campaigns, not to mention individual cases.  The term \"human rights defenders\" has a basis in international law.  It is a well-identified concept which the international community has established.  We select cases through a careful analysis of the degree of influence any particular group can bring to bear in respect of a certain case and what will be the likely impact - both on and beyond said case - of highlighting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1368710400,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Is Mr. O'Gorman referring to Europe-wide cases or those which relate to Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D00800","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368710400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Some of them are Europe-wide.

To somehow try to use the defence that it is a traditional practice does not stand up.  A harmful tradition or practice can be a human rights violation and can be clearly identified as such.  We are working, not just at European but also at global level, to address the issue of female genital mutilation as part of our work on maternal mortality and women's rights in general.  We have a very particular campaign across all 27 member states of the EU which is co-ordinated by the Irish section of Amnesty through our European institutions office.  The aim of this campaign is to try to ensure that the kind of legislation that was thankfully introduced in Ireland in recent years will be forthcoming elsewhere.  That is the type of legislation we want to see being put in place.  However, there is also a need for clear action on the part of the EU in order to address female genital mutilation within Europe.  This is a good example of why we believe there is a need for clear coherence between EU foreign policy and internal policy.  This is, perhaps, a very obvious area in which that is necessary.  If we are going to talk about female genital mutilation - and other issues - in countries where it is a traditional practice, we also need to take seriously the impact of that practice on EU citizens and people living within the Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368710400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>The Chairman inquired about work we are doing in other EU member states.  Amnesty International is involved in a broad body of work across EU member states in respect of torture, monitoring police behaviour, Roma issues, etc.<\/p><p>  I will comment somewhat more specifically on our work in respect of Roma, a matter which was highlighted as a priority for this meeting.  The most important thing to realise about Roma people in the EU is that states are carrying out forced evictions in respect of them.  Roma children are being segregated in schools in EU member states.  That is the burning issue which must be addressed at European level with regard to the broader context of how serious we are about human rights policy.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to Hungary.  The situation there has highlighted a structural issue that exists within the European Union, namely, that if a human rights issue or crisis arises, people are left scrambling around trying to decide how to respond.  It should not be a case of considering the matter in the context of east or west.  As the Roma issue demonstrates very strongly, there are human rights issues across all member states.<\/p> <p>What we need is an internal response to that within the European Union as well as working with the Council of Europe.  We need to respond to that.  We are making recommendations to the Irish Presidency following the fundamental rights conference of the European Union with some practical things that may be considered by the Council Working Party on Fundamental Rights, Citizens Rights and Free Movement of Persons, known as FREMP.  That could be given a stronger role and greater expertise and we could work towards having a European Union internal human rights policy in order that when another situation arises there is no panic in the Union or questions about how we respond.  If this were done we would already have a coherent response ready and a way of responding.  I welcome that this was discussed at the General Affairs Council.  We are keen to see it discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council and at fora such as COSAC or between European affairs committees with regard to the broader issue of what the European Union's internal human rights policy comprises.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the cases.  The cases were selected at our European Union office.  We communicated this to all our national offices in countries throughout Europe.  As Mr. O'Gorman pointed out, we look at where the EU has certain leverage.  We look at cases that are emblematic.  The committee will notice that some of the cases are within the European Union addressing issues on Roma, for example.  We also consider EU guidelines on foreign policy and how to align it and we seek to get a regional overview as well.  Basically, a good deal of thought goes into it, but it is still a difficult task to get it down to nine cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600005#D01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Iverna McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368711000,"counter":633,"content":"<p>You mentioned where the European Union has leverage.

I will be concrete with the example of the Roma people.  There is a race equality directive.  The Commission could bring infringement procedures against certain states which are blatantly in violation of those directives.  There is also political dialogue and it is working together with the Council of Europe in this regard.  However, at the moment certain situations come outside the EU box and that is where the difficulty arises.<\/p><p>  It is somewhat easier in external relations.  There are still inconsistences and double standards in the application of European Union foreign policy but the guidelines are clear.  This is what we request in the case of torture in a third country.  There are guidelines on violence against women.  That is one obvious example.  There are guidelines on what we ask of a third country but within the European Union we do not have a coherent European-wide policy.  There are practical steps we could take.  The 27 member states could all agree to sign and ratify the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  We have been advocating for some time for a strategy on violence against women throughout European Union member states.  The idea is that when there is a human rights dialogue with a third country and a third country asks about the European Union position on violence against women there is a coherent response.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the Syria crisis.  The best thing that could be done at the moment by member states is to ensure it does not happen again that the European Union is somewhat unsure about what it will say.  There is great momentum at the moment.  This was something for which we had been advocating for approximately 15 years at European level.  It was always said that it was not the right forum and that there was no competency.  During President Barroso's state of the Union 2012 speech he referred to the need for some kind of internal response.  It is now being brought to the General Affairs Council.  We hope to see it on the Justice and Home Affairs Council as well.  At EU level there is already thinking about what an internal strategy on human rights might be.  We have the external action plan that we have talked about implementing but the question is what the internal mechanism are.<\/p><p>  There are 27 member states which all have other external human rights obligations under international treaties and their constitutions and obligations that arise directly from membership of the European Union.  Frankly, to say we do not have the competence to do that does not really hold.  In a concrete sense, it is important to have a serious look at ourselves, to be critical and to ensure that there is a place at EU level even within the club where these discussions are taken seriously.  That would be a great step forward and something we would be keen to see with some momentum coming out of the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Iverna McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368711000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The members of the deputation are welcome and I am glad to get the opportunity to meet them.  I am a great admirer of the work that Amnesty International is doing.  It is outstanding.  In particular, I commend its work in the areas of female genital mutilation and Roma rights.  They are important projects and I am pleased that Amnesty International is putting them forward.  It was good to see that the Seanad and the D&aacute;il passed a Bill on female genital mutilation, FGM.  It was given full support by all sides.<\/p><p>  Ms McGowan referred to the Istanbul convention.  We held a considerable discussion on the issue last week because there was a lengthy debate about domestic violence.  It is a considerable problem at the moment in the State.  I note that the convention must be signed by ten states and we are not to the fore in that regard.  We are not leading the charge.  Does Amnesty International have an opinion on that?  Should it be one of our priorities before the end of the Presidency that this State should sign up and lead by example?  Instead of simply talking about human rights we need to practice them ourselves at home.  We tend to be good at talking about these things but when it comes to implementing legislation at home we are seriously lacking.<\/p><p>  I note Amnesty International's recommendations on treating migrants and asylum seekers fairly.  I contend that they are somewhat mild-mannered, to put it mildly.  We are seriously lacking in Ireland, especially in the area of direct provision, in which I have a specific interest.  We should opt in to the EU reception conditions directive.  I gather we are the only EU state that has not done so, apart from Denmark, whose reasoning was that it brought in legislation that went further than the directive.  I would have thought that this measure could have been added to the list of actions in the review card which we could have taken during the Presidency to show how serious we are on that issue.<\/p><p>  Where does Amnesty International stand on direct provision?  Is the organisation concerned that there is a serious violation of human rights in the direct provision system in Ireland?  Some of the organisations which campaign on behalf of people in asylum believe this is the case and they are concerned especially with regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and contraventions of the convention relating to direct provision.  Specifically, there is concern about Article 8 which relates to the right to privacy and family life.  I note the statement in the Amnesty International report that there are legal and political issues hampering the implementation or development of the EU Convention on Human Rights.  Will the deputation expand on that and explain what exactly they mean and perhaps put it into lay parlance?  Who is holding it up and why?<\/p><p>  Amnesty International has made an important statement on corporate human rights.  Since that was put together we have heard of the tragedy in Bangladesh and the people who died there.  That focuses the mind on the necessity of working on corporate human rights.

There are particular difficulties in this regard.  A study was done by the council relating to EU citizens having difficulty being reunited with family members or partners and so on.<\/p><p>  Most of the groups who work as advocates on behalf of these people have been affected by austerity.

To follow on from Senator Terry Leyden's introductory remarks, I remember well the particular occasion which the Senator courageously and generously shared with the rest of the committee.<\/p><p>  Two important points have emerged.  Prejudice is something that grows if not challenged.  It grows in all societies, in developing societies and in developed and sophisticated countries.  There is a considerable amount of prejudice throughout many European countries, some of which are established citadels of democracy, and it is growing as time goes on.  It grows simply because it is accepted and it meets a situation that arises from time to time, particularly at times of economic stringency.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding what the last speaker had to say, economic stringency affects everybody.  People move into their respective corners when they feel threatened.  I agree that we need to confront this.  We need to establish certain norms by way of setting down particular guidelines beyond which we should not allow ourselves or our neighbours to go.  I was a member of the original convention which drafted the human rights charter.  We discussed all of those issues in great detail at that particular time.  We had brave ideas as to how to solve the problems which presented to us at that time.  There was also a recognition that resources would be an issue in many cases, of the type developing and unfolding now.  <\/p><p> Two distinct issues arise in the context of existing and incoming member states of the European Union.  First, we must set our own standards and ensure we keep to them, notwithstanding how difficult that may be.  While doing so may not from time to time be popular, we have to do it.  Second, we must recognise the erosion of basic fundamental rights standards in some of the more sophisticated European countries and the degree to which slippage in this regard is occurring.  There is quite an amount of racist reactionary attitudes developing throughout the European Union.  In this regard, one has only to look to international media coverage of some of the events in more recent times, in particular those affecting migrant workers from non-member states, including in future accessionary countries.  We must be critical and question to what extent we can stand over much of what has happening without condemnation; to what extent we can address and improve the situation and what we can learn from the serious mistakes of the past so as to ensure they do not recur.  <\/p><p> The issue of FGM has been raised.  All of us have been dealing with this issue in our constituency work for many years.  It is a serious issue of discrimination that has become acceptable, which is sad.  FGM is an appalling, repulsive and disgusting practice.  I know that some people resent it being described in that manner.  However, the number of cases with which I have had to deal in recent times involving the hospitalisation of women who had undergone this practice years ago is horrifying.  I take the delegates' point on the need for more focus on this issue.<\/p><p> Everybody in this country says \"I am not a racist but\".  The \"but\" is used less frequently now than previously.  While we have improved, some sensitive situations need to be addressed.  Situations can develop overnight, be it in regard to Roma people, Travellers and so on.  It may well be that the various ethnic groups will have to try to address this themselves.  While we need to encourage them to do so and to evolve to meet certain standards there is a need for us to focus to a far greater extent that normally on the dangers in times of economic stress.  It should not be forgotten that there are many difficult situations emerging in this country and across Europe, which have been thrust upon us by economic difficulties.  These issues cannot be resolved overnight.  We all deal on a daily basis with horrific cases of economic deprivation.  I do not agree with the notion that the answer can be plucked out of the clouds and the situation can be resolved overnight.  We are in a difficult situation.  We must try to live up to the highest possible standards and ensure we do not digress but maintain those standards regardless of the threat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600006#E00700","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368711600,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome Mr. O'Gorman and Ms McGowan.  Like other speakers, I hugely admire the work and objectives of Amnesty International and its notable successes around the world.  One shudders to think of what might happen in the absence of Amnesty International.  I apologise for not being present to hear the presentation but I was making a Second Stage contribution in the D&aacute;il.  I believed it was important to attend the meeting to register my support for Amnesty International and my admiration for what it does and its objectives.  I have a couple of reasons for doing so.  As a citizen, member of this committee, public representative and leader of the Irish delegation of the Council of Europe, I am aware of the clear overlap between what Amnesty International does and what the Council of Europe does.  Obviously, we have shared objectives.  I take this opportunity to affirm the work of Amnesty International and, in particular, Mr. O'Gorman.<\/p><p>  There is much work being done at Council of Europe level on the issue of violence against women.  I have taken part in plenary sessions in that regard.  Considerable work is being done, as should be the case.  I agree with Mr. O'Gorman that a subset of violence against women is FGM.  It is an issue much discussed at the Council of Europe.  Perhaps Mr. O'Gorman would in his response be prescriptive in terms of what he believes can be done by particular countries.  It is difficult to enact legislation that reaches into sub-cultures.  I agree without question about the barbarity of the practice and so on.  However, how one polices such practices in communities and so on is difficult.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. O'Gorman's response in this regard.<\/p><p>  I am also interested in hearing with Mr. O'Gorman's response to my question on domestic violence.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's fundamental point that we should sign up to all international charters on the matter.  Perhaps the Chairman will enlighten us in this regard.  I am interested in hearing Mr. O'Gorman's response to the following.  In my view, our record in dealing with domestic violence here is good.  Perhaps I am wrong but I believe that to be the case given the various levels of intervention here in that regard.  The Women's Aid charm campaign is running in my constituency and is hugely successful.  There is also a great free legal aid support system in my constituency and a shelter in Navan.  My personal experience has been that our response to domestic violence is very good.  However, I am open correction.<\/p><p>  Islamophobia is an issue that often comes up for discussion.  At the last plenary session of the Council of Europe I spoke about the issue of discrimination against religious groups, in particular the Coptic Christians in Egypt and Tunisia.  I also spoke about Islamophobia, which is currently a huge problem in Europe.  It arises out of the current economic position we are in and particular events, including 9\/11.  All of those events have had an adverse effect on the lives of ordinary people and feed into Islamophobia.  We need to do something about this.  I accept it is not within the remit of Amnesty International or us to comment on the politics of a neighbouring country.  The local election results in the UK are disturbing and alarming in terms of one-quarter of all votes going to one particular political grouping with links to Islamophobia and so on.<\/p> <p>The point about the Roma is well made.  I was not here for Mr. O'Gorman's initial contribution but I read his submission.  It is a difficult issue but it needs to be addressed.  It is great that Amnesty International is here and it is important for us to publicly affirm its work.  At the risk of being repetitive, it is also important that we put our shoulders to the wheel on the issues raised.  I have immense admiration for what Amnesty International does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600007#F00200","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368712200,"counter":642,"content":"<p>In regard to Islamophobia, the witnesses will be aware that Ireland hopes to open a chapter on Turkey's accession to the European Union but there will undoubtedly be resistance to Turkish membership.

Our European institutions office covers the European region, including both the Council of Europe and the EU.<\/p><p>  One of our recommendations is that Ireland should set out its own timeline for signing and ratifying the Istanbul convention but the Presidency should also encourage other EU member states to ratify it.  We are back to the question of leadership.  We can speak about the role Ireland needs to play as a country that claims to champion human rights issues, quite rightly in the international context in particular, but we need to demonstrate that leadership within the EU and at national level.  If one of the founding principles of the EU is human rights, it needs to demonstrate a commitment to that principle.  This means advancing, promoting and protecting the human rights of those who live in the EU.  It cannot be limited to a dialogue around accession that is dropped from the table the moment a state becomes a member of the club.  This is a huge ongoing issue.<\/p><p>  We have serious concerns about conditions in direct provision centres, mainly because of the length of time people spend in them.  The major difficulty is that children are growing up in direct provision centres and we are concerned about the impact on family life, child development and mental health for those who are forced to live in one room in a contained environment.  These people are not able to live freely as families and individuals.  Although we regard this area as a pressing concern, we are not actively working in it because we do not have the capacity to do so alongside everything else we need to do.  A range of highly credible and effective organisations are focused on the treatment of people in direct provision and the conditions such people experience.  At our most recent annual conference our membership adopted a motion calling on the Government to review conditions in direct provision but we regard the timely adoption of a single protection procedure as a core solution to this difficulty.  Single protection has been a stated commitment of Governments over many years but we still do not have a procedure.  Previous Governments have proposed procedures that would allow all cases to be fully processed within six months.  When asylum seekers or refugees come to the State to seek protection it might be appropriate or reasonable to accommodate them in direct provision for a period of six months while the State discharges its responsibilities but to fail to process applications for multiple years, and permit children to grow up in direct provision, is a matter we take very seriously.<\/p><p>  On the effects of austerity, when the Government of the day was in negotiations with the troika over the obligations it would be required to sign up to in regard to bank debt, it would have been interesting if it had on hand a counterbalancing set of legally binding obligations to the people who live in this State.  The Government could have accepted the need to take on its obligations in the context of the crisis it faced while also asserting legally binding obligations in areas of health, education, social care, protection of humans and other human rights areas.  That is why Amnesty International views the incorporation of economic, social and cultural rights into our Constitution as a priority.  We need the added strength such protections would give to human rights accountability.  They would also give Governments a tool in making difficult decisions around how they use the people's resources to best effect in the interest of the people living in the State.  We are concerned about the impact of the economic crisis on human rights.  There is no doubt that human rights standards have declined in key areas as a result of austerity.  This is similarly evident in several European states.  We intend to do more to examine this issue more closely.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan used powerful language in speaking about guidelines and standards beyond which we should not allow ourselves to go.  We would love to reach that point but we are still discussing minimum standards.  When I speak to legislators and policy makers about economic, social and cultural rights, I sometimes get the response that these are not real rights.  When we advocate the advancement of human rights international law, we do not refer to laws we might have written as an NGO but to laws that were agreed and adopted by states.  Deputy Durkan was usefully involved in the development of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  These are not aspirational standards; they are core obligations to which states willingly and voluntarily agreed.  We are asking states to respect the laws they wrote and to make them meaningful.  We ask Ireland to protect and promote the laws it developed in the international context by observing them at home and showing leadership at EU level and beyond in advancing these core minimum standards.  We are gravely concerned about the erosion of human rights standards in a number of areas.<\/p><p>  When we speak about a practice as barbaric as FGM, we are not adopting some distant position or sitting here as white Europeans to talk about practices in certain cultures.  Many practices in our own recent history would be viewed as equally barbaric by other societies.  We live in a State where the gravest human rights violations one can imagine were visited on marginalised groups in the interest of prescribed morality.  That might have been explained away through the norms of religious or traditional belief.  Our work on FGM, particularly at European level, is driven by rights holder participation.  We have a strong voice from women who are directly affected by the experience of FGM and who can guide our work.  Rather than speaking as outsiders looking in, we are developing our position based on our engagement with rights holders and trying to find effective solutions based on their experience and what they tell us.  We can share more information about these models with the committee if members so wish.<\/p> <p> It is always useful to look at the national experience when addressing issues such as violence against women, and there is a great deal we could improve.  It is fair to say matters in Ireland have improved in the past decade in particular when we examine the area of gender based violence, sexual violence and domestic violence but we still have a long way to go in that regard.  That is not necessarily the focus of this set of recommendations because we are talking about recommendations to the Presidency in the context of its leadership within the European Union.<\/p><p> A key priority for us would be fore Ireland to sign and ratify the Istanbul convention.  We have not been given any indication yet that there is a commitment to either sign or ratify the convention of which I am aware; Ms McGowan can correct me if I am wrong about that.<\/p><p> On the question generally of discrimination, something we believe must happen is movement on the anti-discrimination directive, which currently is in a nowhere place.  The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, said it was something she hoped to see advanced during the Presidency but we must be clear that it is member states that are blocking the adoption of the directive.  If we want to improve human rights conditions within Europe, we must strengthen both the competency of the EU to address human rights violations where they are occurring and where states are in breach, for instance, of their obligations under the fundamental charter but also strengthen the hand of the institutions, and the anti-discrimination directive is important in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368712800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>We will ask the Minister of State about that.

The Deputy will know that in the context of the Irish legislation there was a strong focus on the need for the principle of extra-territoriality to be included in that legislation because in our experience of talking to affected communities we know it is important to empower parents in particular with those principles.  This is to ensure that if they are returning to a community where they are under significant pressure to allow their children be subject to FGM they will say they cannot because when they return to whatever European country they are living in it is a criminal offence.  That is an important principle.  There is concern about the return of women and girls to practising communities, the practice within the EU but also how we respond to EU citizens and people living within the EU who have been subjected to FGM.  There is a broad range of concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013051600009#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368712800,"counter":653,"content":"<p>We have included a good deal of work on the asylum directives also, which was raised, in terms of people arriving at borders and then the follow-up on FGM in terms of women in detention in some cases having just entered European borders.

It is also about strengthening the calls at the United Nations for concrete policy and legislation.  A question was asked about what we can do in concrete terms to fight against FGM.  Amnesty International has an e-learning tool for health care providers which goes into detail on the practical steps because all too often legislation is adopted but not implemented on the ground or dealt with.<\/p><p>  With regard to accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, our office is called the European Institutions Office because we deal with both the European Union and the Council of Europe.  Members will find in the mid-term review of our evaluation that we welcomed that finally, the draft agreement for EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights has been agreed.  The challenge now is the so-called internal rules.  One of the actions we called for in the mid-term review is a more transparent dialogue on what these internal reviews will entail.  Will they serve to limit what ultimately will be the consequences of EU accession or will they be in line with the purpose and cause of that convention, namely, to protect and promote human rights in the European Union?

In our area, Mourne, Louth and Carlingford Lough, it is not working for us.  Narrow Water Bridge ticks so many boxes in the Good Friday Agreement, which refers to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity in section 6.  There is a lack of economic growth and we have pursued the Narrow Water Bridge project as a means of increasing economic growth in our area.  Aspects of the business case put forward by Louth County Council show that employment growth potential after the completion of the bridge will be upwards of 270 jobs.  With such spending power in our local economy, we see further potential for growth.  Our emphasis is not only on tourism, but also local commerce.<\/p><p>  The project also ticks boxes in respect of social cohesion in urban, rural and Border areas.  We live in a Border area that has become, in recent years, inaccessible.  The documentation we have provided shows we have had contact with our neighbours from the earliest times.  When we lost the Warrenpoint-Omeath ferry, communities on both sides of the lough suffered.  The tourism industry died and the Narrow Water Bridge is our means of regeneration.  Not only have we rekindled cross-Border relationships in pursuit of the project, it has brought both communities along the Mourne coastal region much closer.  We see our future as being dependent on one another.  Warrenpoint, Kilkeel, Newcastle, Omeath and Carlingford cannot survive on their own.  We must co-operate along the coast and across the Border to survive.  Relationships between the communities in the Mourne coastal communities have improved beyond recognition in pursuit of this project.  One of our members said that creating employment, retaining employment, putting food on the table, filling oil tanks, and keeping the doors of our businesses open surmounts any divisions.  Divisions remain but constant conversations have been breaking down the barriers between ourselves and our neighbours.<\/p> <p>The Agreement also states that it should strengthen physical infrastructure, producing new approaches to transport.  The Narrow Water Bridge does this.  It ticks all the boxes in this instance.  The bridge is there to unite people on a social level and on an economic level, a bridge to renew the access formerly enjoyed by the people of Omeath, Carlingford and Warrenpoint to professional and commercial services and co-operation between emergency services and health and education services in their everyday lives.  The Northern Ireland Executive and the Assembly were obliged to introduce an economic development strategy for Northern Ireland.  We have seen little of this.<\/p><p> We see this development as a self-help strategy for our area.  We cannot wait any longer.  The people on both sides of the lough see and have pursued the bridge as our contribution to the economic growth of our area.  The bridge is shovel ready with guaranteed planning permission and 80% funding but we cannot seem to be able to get the commitment of the finance department of the Stormont government.  This project is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement and it should be done.  The bridge is 280 m long, but to us it is half a world away, and we need to see action on it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368700200,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  Over recent years, we have worked together with Newry and Mourne District Council and the various chambers of commerce to try to build economic stability in the region.  The memorandum of understanding signed by Louth County Council, Newry and Mourne District Council and the various organisations, including Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and Warrenpoint Chamber of Commerce, has been a catalyst in creating both an environment in which we can all work together and a network, which is allowing this area to develop.  That MOU is unique in Europe and is recognised as such because the original documentation was signed in Brussels.  The memorandum addresses a number of issues of mutual interest but it is primarily aimed at regenerating the area.  The tourism potential is enormous and that is what makes it so important.<\/p><p>  A report published by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government ten days ago indicated that Dundalk is the weakest gateway town of the nine gateways in the country.  Our unemployment rate is 25% above the national average.  We were well aware of these figures because the two chambers of commerce, Louth County Council and Newry and Mourne District Council commissioned a report three years ago which highlighted this.  The Department's report reinforces the message.  We have nine gateways in the South, and Dundalk has the joint lowest score, together with Letterkenny.  This indicates that the Border area is a major problem, not just in County Louth.  The fact that both towns with the lowest score are on the Border is an interesting factor.<\/p><p>  We need to get those in the area to work together as a unit.  Members of Newry and Mourne District Council sit on the Louth Economic Forum and one of its major recommendations is that when we address the infrastructure of County Louth, we should automatically think of Newry and Mourne at the same time.  That is the thinking that is going on within the various organisations and we need this bridge, which will give a physical dimension to what people want on the ground.  It is for that reason that we believe strongly that because our unemployment rate is so high, the unskilled and semi-skilled jobs which are needed will be provided by the tourism and construction industries.  As Mr. Boylan said, construction alone would generate 200 jobs.  That is what makes this so important.  The PayPal jobs and other jobs we have attracted to the town over the past 12 months have had an impact on one aspect of our economy but not on the other.  PayPal is employing as many people from the North as it is from the South.  When we talk about major industries going into the area, we do not stop at the Border.<\/p><p>  One of the first calls I received when we were looking at PayPal was from a councillor based in Newry who is a member of Newry Chamber of Commerce, and his first question was: \"How do I get into PayPal?\"  We have set up that relationship in order that we work together all the time.  This bridge will be a physical manifestation of what we in the chambers of commerce have been seeking for several years.  I first met Mr. Boylan about this project four years ago.  We believe strongly in its economic impact on the area, which is needed.  This is an area of major deprivation.  Newry is ranked the second worst area in the North after Strabane, and it includes the greater Warrenpoint area.  It is an economic blackspot both north and south of the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1368700200,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Malone, who has set a good precedent regarding brevity.

It is a unique area which could attract many thousands of visitors annually.  Having attended one of the meetings in Warrenpoint, we stopped at the Carrickdale Hotel on the way home, and I met two people from Navan, County Meath, who had spent five nights in Carlingford.  They said if the bridge had been in place, they would have spent two weeks in the area.

In Warrenpoint, planning permission has been granted for vacant buildings in the square to be converted to retail businesses.  That would not have happened without the good news about the bridge.  The planning authorities on both sides of the Border have provided planning approval, marine consents have been provided, along with funding from SEUPB  to the tune of &euro;17.4 million and the Irish Government has provided matched funding of up to &euro;4 million.  The only outstanding elements are the bridge order to facilitate navigation, which is currently out to consultation.  The committee will recall that Newry and Mourne Council, Louth County Council and the DRD have provided the funding that will adjust the mussel boats, allowing navigation under the bridge when it opens.  That impediment will be removed.<\/p><p>  The remaining impediment is the outstanding funding, about &euro;2 million for the Northern Ireland Executive.  The Northern Ireland Assembly has already approved a motion on a majority vote in November indicating this project would have major economic and social implications for the whole of the area between south Down and County Louth.

I am sure there are many who have had long-standing relations arising from this project.  The argument over its benefits is not an issue, those are accepted by all but a small minority.  I was up Slieve Martin a few weeks ago and passed the new bicycle trail.  The majority of cars parked there were from Waterford, Kilkenny and similar areas, with people coming on a Sunday morning because it is easier to get through Newry to access the Warrenpoint side of the lough.  We can see the potential investments for the Mourne Mountains area by both councils to attract visitors and have an exchange up and down the east coast.<\/p><p>   I know from my experience as the Minister for Regional Development for four years that there is no technical or environmental issue that could not be addressed; it is down to the Department of Finance and Personnel giving the go-ahead.  If officials are not given political direction to move, they have a habit of allowing things to stagnate.  It is clearly a matter of political direction being given at senior level in the Department of Finance and Personnel to get this over the last hurdle.  A huge amount has been done, particularly by Louth County Council, which has carried the project.  There was a time when many people thought this was pie in the sky but it carried it right through and brought it to the point where it secured the crucial funding from Europe.  It is a matter of the Department of Finance and Personnel in the North stepping up to the plate on this.<\/p><p>  I assume the two chambers want elected representatives on both sides of the Border to use this committee's influence to apply pressure.  We will ask the Taoiseach to raise this directly with the First and Deputy First Ministers and will ask the Minister for Finance to raise it with his counterpart in the North.  The committee should apply whatever pressure it can on this because the economic benefits are clear.  The great pity would be if this is missed because of some bureaucratic stagnation.  It is not just the loss of the benefit but the loss of the funding for the area from the EU would be massive and the reputation of both Administrations when it comes to accessing EU money would be damaged, which would have implications for funding for Ireland as a whole.  We are happy to hear from the chambers of commerce about what they would like the committee to do to press support for this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600004#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1368700800,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the presentation.  This project must go ahead.  Almost 90% of the funding is in place, sourced from the European Union and our own Government, and the case has been well made.  There is huge potential in the Carlingford Lough area, north and south of the Border, for the tourism industry.  It is on the east coast and is a short distance from both Dublin and Belfast.  With the road network now both cities are easily reachable, which gives that added benefit when attracting visitors.  It is an area with massive potential that I have visited many times.<\/p><p>  I was involved in the early 1990s with the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, which is now the Erne-Shannon waterway.  That project was announced in 1989 and completed by 1992, at a time when there was no political co-operation on this island or between east and west.  We were going through very difficult times politically and the cost of the project at the time was &pound;30 million, well in excess of &euro;40 million now.  That was at a time when there were challenging economic problems facing the country both North and South.  At that time, the leadership and commitment was there to restore a canal and it has added tremendously to the tourism potential of Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim, and to the broader inland waterway network.  That was a time when the project did not have full political support North or South.  Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned this commmittee has total political support and my colleague Deputy Kirk has tabled questions to the T&aacute;naiste today on the issue.  It will add considerably to the tourism product for all of the Ireland.<\/p><p>  When we think that marketing the country as a tourism destination comes under the remit of one of the all-Ireland implementation bodies, it would be a disgrace if this project is not brought to fruition at an early date.  It merits the full support of everyone with an interest in the future of this island, North and South.  I commend those representatives in the local area who have in more difficult times championed this cause, along with other groups like the chambers of commerce.

We must ensure this project is given priority because it will reinvigorate Counties Louth and Down, drawing tourists to those areas from all over the country.  The bridge will shorten trips for the local community by 40 minutes, which is a significant amount of time, particularly for business people.  The bridge will also enable the development of a new empathy between the communities on both sides of the Border, as well as improving employment and economic prospects in the area.  It is a wonderful area to visit from a tourism perspective and has enormous potential for further development.

It is entirely appropriate that the group should attend a meeting of this committee to advocate for a worthy and worthwhile project in the north east.  It goes without saying that the Narrow Water Bridge project has been a long time in gestation.  I have vivid memories of attending meetings in the Park Hotel in Omeath long before the peace process commenced.  At the time, a number of people on the southern side of Carlingford Lough were strongly advocating exploring the potential of the project, with a view to progressing a bridge across the lough.  The proposal was met with considerable scepticism.  People did not see merit in the project when it was first proposed in the 1980s, a period of significant economic difficulty.  The peace process has created a powerful dynamic for those pursuing the project.<\/p><p>  A bridge across Carlingford Lough would have clear economic benefits.  Anyone who is familiar with the geography of the Mourne Mountains and Cooley Peninsula will acknowledge that the area is largely undiscovered by tourism interests and remains undeveloped in many respects.  This key infrastructure project would make a major difference.  Apart from bridging the Newry River at Narrow Water, it would act as a powerful symbol and send a message that the peace process is working.  It would be a sign that the Stormont Executive is willing to flex its muscles and proceed with worthwhile, cross-Border projects where they provide clear and tangible economic benefits for both the North and South.<\/p><p>  The benefits of the project would be felt not only on the Cooley Peninsula, in Dundalk and around the general north County Louth region but also in south County Down and further afield, including County Armagh.  I have long advocated development of the tourism industry in the three counties in question.  Tourism development in the region has lagged somewhat for reasons those present will fully understand.  I know a number of the older sages in the Omeath area who used to tell tales of people, mainly from Belfast, travelling to Warrenpoint in the 1940s and 1950s, before crossing to Omeath by ferry.  While there was a considerable demand for private transport to Carlingford, the village of Omeath was the tourism Mecca in the Cooley Peninsula at that point, with Carlingford regarded as something of a backwater.  I can say this now because Senator Terry Brennan has left the meeting, although I accept that the status and standing of Carlingford has changed considerably in the intervening period.  The caravan park at Cranfield on the northern side of Carlingford shows that the gravitational pull of the lough is also strong on the northern side.<\/p><p>  As I stated, public meetings on a proposed bridge were held at the Park Hotel and other venues in the 1980s.  At that time, the Oireachtas Members in north County Louth were the former Deputies Dermot Ahern and Brendan McGahan and myself.  We did our best to progress the project and keep it on the political agenda, and I am pleased it is still on the political agenda.  Of all the projects to come onto our radar, it will be of major benefit to north Louth and south Down.  Let us get on with the project.  Anyone who has any influence with the finance Minister in Stormont should nudge him gently towards accepting the merits of the proposal.  A financial package has been put together by the special EU programmes body, Louth County Council and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The missing link is the Northern Executive, which must also provide funding.  I hope the project can be progressed.  A delegation met the Taoiseach when he visited Dundalk recently and made a strong case for making direct contact with Mr. Wilson in an effort to move the project forward.  Anybody else in the political arena who has influence on the Minister should exercise that influence.<\/p><p>  Is there any merit in seeking a meeting with the Minister?  Perhaps a representative group could sit down with him to discuss the benefits of the project and identify any perceived hitches that may arise.  At this point, I do not envisage any problems as the proposal has been thoroughly examined from a technical, economic and political point of view.  Let us hope, therefore, that the project can be progressed.  It may not be appropriate to arrange a meeting with Mr. Wilson.  Others may be in a better position to decide whether it would be a worthwhile to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600006#E00200","speaker":"945"},{"type":"speech","time":1368702000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>The delegation is very welcome.  It is great to have before us people with vision who have been able to keep the proposal for a bridge over Carlingford Lough on the political agenda for so long.

Building the bridge would be an important symbolic gesture of the progress that is being made.  What practical steps can the joint committee take to advance the proposal?  Should we arrange a meeting with or write to the Minister of Finance and Personnel in the North?  Members must decide at the conclusion of this meeting on the course of action we will take.  We should do something tangible to try to advance the project.  I wish the delegation well in its efforts.  Everyone present is positively disposed the project, which I hope will be advanced shortly.<\/p><p>  Cross-Border tourism projects that have proceeded in the past have promoted development along the Border and helped attract visitors to the region from home and abroad.  As a frequent visit to north Louth and Carlingford, I am aware of the hassle one has in trying to visit Warrenpoint or Rostrevor on the northern side of the lough as one must travel through Newry first.  People from either side of the lough would definitely travel to the other side much more frequently if a bridge were in place.  The project would also develop the economic potential of the area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600006#E00300","speaker":"972"},{"type":"speech","time":1368702000,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I commend the chambers of commerce and councils involved in this project, particularly the individuals who came up with the idea and kept faith with it.

One needs to give careful consideration to whether it would be of benefit for the committee to write to Mr. Wilson given that the DUP's position is one of opposition to the Good Friday Agreement.  While it is clearly not opposed to the Agreement, which it is working, it may be a bridge too for Sammy to receive correspondence in the name of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Committee.  I have been in touch with the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Danny Kennedy.

That is a momentous development which will help to increase tourism.  People will come to see the bridge because of its historical implications.  The second point is that tourists who arrive in Dublin or Belfast usually stay on the motorway and do not come off it to visit our area.

My company brings the message on cross-Border tourism to trade shows all across the United States.  There are five American tours travelling around the area.  We will be on a further trade mission from 5 to 17 June which will target states on the west coast of America such as Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, etc.<\/p><p>  It is important to highlight the peace dimension of this matter.

We need to encourage as many people as possible to experience both sides of it.  The tourism potential is huge.  These two beautiful areas which span County Louth and south County Down bring an additional focus on Carlingford Lough and its environs.

Victims have spoken movingly of their stories, their quest for justice and justice denied.  Horrific as this violence was, and continues to be in some cases, there is another masked and hidden violence.  Thousands of victims have gone to Rape Crisis Centres, counselling, Women's Aid and other organisations because they suffered horrendous domestic and sexual abuse.  They are victims of hidden crimes or what the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 refers to as a political crime.<\/p><p>  We refer to this type of violence as being hidden.  It is generally and inadequately reflected in the reporting of crime statistic figures in the North.  Over the years piecemeal research has been conducted in the North.  Some years ago the National Women's Council, in conjunction with Foyle Women's Aid, held public conferences on the issue and called it the \"other violence\".  There was little support or awareness of what these women and children had to go through.<\/p><p>  Today, I sent the committee a presentation on the family justice centre and Foyle Women's Aid is keen to commence the project on the island of Ireland.  I supplied as much information as I could in the presentation and I am happy to answer questions.  We want to open a Family Justice Centre because there are still many barriers to justice for women, children and men in the North.  The proposed family justice centre would also cater for men.<\/p><p>  We have a legacy of policing being housed in large buildings that are inaccessible or intimidating and are under threat of attack by dissident groups.  There is no normality of services and the buildings can prevent families from approaching them.  Sometimes people are intimidated and threatened by communities if they seek justice or take their cases through the natural processes that take place anywhere else.  Sometimes the politics of the North takes precedence over domestic violence services.  For example, a dissident threat or something that happens at a political level leads to all of the domestic violence services disappearing on those days.  <\/p><p>  Domestic violence impacts on young people and families.  Domestic violence can lead to certain behaviour in many young people that needs support.  They need help to deal with the matter.  Unfortunately, some of these young people are dealt with in a very violent fashion within communities.  It has become common for some of our young people to be led up lanes and shot in their knees.  People accept that as being okay and view it as normal.  We need to address some of the issues of anti-social behaviour in other ways and get rid of such violent behaviour.  <\/p><p>  All services provided to all victims must be professional and all of the professionals must sing off the same hymn sheet.  Sexual violence also needs to be addressed.  There has been a gap in services throughout the 30 years of violence.  Women have told Women's Aid about sexual violence that they could not speak about before.  We need to examine how to provide them with a service.  Many of the cases in the courts are historical ones that happened 30 years ago.  <\/p><p>  All family violence damages individuals, families and communities.  Investing in communities without tackling domestic terrorism, which in itself destroys communities and families, means that we do not have peace.  We cannot have peace without tackling the matter.  My group seeks the support of the committee to develop the first family justice centre in Ireland and to work in partnership with the South.  I hope that we can further develop the project.  We have already signed up with the European Alliance and I shall visit the US at the end of June.  We have also signed up with the US Alliance and hope that Ireland will be included in the provision of services that will be developed in Europe and the US.  <\/p><p>  I thank the committee and hope that it will support me in starting to address the violent culture in Ireland, to stop it flourishing any further and to achieve some meaningful peace in the North.  I am open to answering any questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Brown"},{"type":"speech","time":1368703800,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Brown.

Their presence today has helped to create a greater awareness of very difficult issues among public representatives and, hopefully, the wider society.  Ms Brown mentioned issues that confront many individuals and families.  She also mentioned that \"hidden\" violence is not adequately reported.  If issues are not adequately reported or there is a lack of awareness then they will not be tackled.  Therefore, it is important that the delegation had this opportunity, and has the same opportunity at other fora, to outline the difficulties, challenges and the need to provide adequate services for people.<\/p><p>  I accept the excellent point made by Ms Brown that sometimes people who are vulnerable or in difficult circumstances are reluctant to go to an institutional building that is associated with a major State and statutory organisation.  I presume that when she talked about a family justice centre that she was talking about services being provided in a more supportive environment.  Did she mean that there should be a service for the community, not just a State imposed service?  Does she want a family justice centre to be in one building and providing a number of services ranging from health to other supports?  Does she want it modelled on another family justice centre?  Having read the presentation I understood that the family justice centre would be the first of its kind in Europe?  Did she model it on another centre?  Is it a greenfield idea by the group?  <\/p><p>  Obviously adequate funding should be provided.  I presume that some services are already being provided by the State.  Does Ms Brown hope to bring them in under the family justice centre umbrella?  If so, there would be better co-ordination and outturn from the point of view of the service provider and the service recipient.  Another tranche of funding will be available from PEACE IV programme to deal with issues and legacy issues.  Ms Brown mentioned legacy cases and that some of the incidents were 30 years old or older.  Has the group sought funding for new facilities or whatever from the special European Union programme?  I have listened to the presentation. <\/p> <p>It is the sort of project we should support that would make a difference on a daily basis to people who are obviously in a difficult position.<\/p><p> I compliment Ms Browne and Ms Corcoran on their work, which is very important, in an area that must be adequately resourced.  I come across domestic violence as a representative of a large rural constituency like Cavan-Monaghan but not to the extent that might happen in more urban areas.  That is the make-up of the constituency but there are incidents of domestic violence, although not to the extent outlined today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600009#H00600","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368704400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.

How does that affect the group's work?  I remember the principal of a small primary school saying to me once that if she started mandatory reporting in her area, she would have to close the school because everyone is related.

In Australia at one stage there were proposals for family relationship centres but the idea was to move some family law out of the courts for mediation.

Deputy Smith mentioned this perhaps being more common in urban areas but I do not know if that is the case, although I am certainly aware of it.  I recently dealt with a family where the partner had a serious crack cocaine drug problem.  The house was being turned into a crack house, there were children there, domestic violence, and people were coming in to intimidate others and to look for money for drugs, and guns were being produced.  It is similar to some of the worst cases the group has dealt with in its own centre.  There was a difficulty, however, in trying to rehouse the woman in a refuge and after a time she wanted to move back into the house.  There were no support services and she was literally moving back into a tip with young children and very little support for basic services like having the door fixed.  If these support services were in place it would be a massive help, with a one-stop-shop for services that would give people more confidence to escape this situation.  It is a visionary idea in that sense.  How would it impact on existing services and how would they be complementary?  Would it pull the services into the centre or would it be additional to them?<\/p><p>  How can connections be made for training on a North-South basis?  Funding is the difficult area.

The family justice centre will offer existing services, so it does not displace any services, but they will be collocated in the old convent building.  The idea is that everyone will be trained and while they will have different professions, we will all have the same approach.  Research has shown that families must make as many as 23 visits to other agencies when domestic or sexual violence first occurs.  They get worn out and that is a barrier to their coming forward.  Having the agencies in place and making the agencies do the work instead of the victims has been shown to be more successful.<\/p><p>  I first saw that model seven years ago in New York.<\/p> <p>In New York I was part of a community builder programme, which is a peace building programme.  I saw the programme in operation and was instantly attracted because it was working in a diverse city with many communities.  I was also attracted to it because of the difficulties we were experiencing in Northern Ireland where some communities will not go forward to the police either because of the past or because they felt intimidated.  The services were not working for a range of other reasons but other models are available.  The family justice centre will sign up to a partnership with a centre in San Diego where the main training academy for family justice centres in the United States is located.  When I visited New York, one family justice centre was in place and a second one was in development.  There are now six family justice centres in New York, one in each borough, and they are being established elsewhere.  For example, five other European countries, including Germany, are starting to develop family justice centres.  We will sign up to a partnership with these centres and we hope to receive some European funding to help us develop something in the North.<\/p><p> If we have one centre on the island, we will have a place to bring people.  It would be possible to provide joint training for staff and various agencies.  I do not know how this would develop but given the very tight budgets, we could certainly do much more in terms of sharing some of the things around domestic violence and adopting existing models rather than inventing new ones or paying for different training.  We have already established links to a group in Galway.  The family justice centres work very well because satellite clinics can be established in rural areas where people do not have the same supports as people in urban areas.  We will have to take an innovative approach.  We have developed Internet and texting services and women are starting to contact us through the Internet.  For example, we use Skype, social media and so forth to try to reach families who would be difficult to reach otherwise.<\/p><p> In terms of the trafficking of women, our centre has been designated one of the centres to provide accommodation and services for trafficked women.  We work with the Executive to provide these services and trafficked women come into the centre.  All of those who come to us at present do so on referral from the police.  Like everything else, when one starts to work in a certain area, one realises that there is a problem.  In the case of trafficking, we are starting to realise that it exists.  Trafficked women receive automatic support in the centre through an inter-agency approach.  We hope to be able to provide free legal advice and obtain funding for an on-the-day big barrier for women.  People seem to forget about women who are working or are on limited budgets.  The legal process can be very expensive and receiving good advice on what one's options are immediately and knowing what is available can reduce confusion and remove the need for running around.  For this reason, it is important for agencies to work together to decide how to provide help and support. <\/p><p> Ms Corcoran had a meeting with our \"Voices\" group and one of the main issues that arose was social security and the blockages and barriers facing working women, for example, those who have a house to sell and do not have money to live on.  Agencies must come together and share resources if they are to work more effectively.  In our case, one agency at a time will deal with a family and all the agencies know what the others are doing.  It is a poor use of resources to have six agencies becoming involved in one family simultaneously and then all of them moving on at the same time.  <\/p><p> Our centre is a build to invest scheme.  It is located in a convent in Derry which is a listed, protected building.  Derry is the City of Culture 2013.  The centre is in the city centre which means any woman can walk in while shopping.  We selected the location because it is neutral and we are open to all creeds.  We plan to have an exhibition centre to celebrate women's contribution in Northern Ireland and other issues.  The exhibition centre, like the coffee shop, will operate as a social economy business and all of the proceeds will go to families.<\/p><p> We are examining how to get families into back to work schemes.  We have a training agency and a business plan has been done with PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Two partners from London were so interested in work that they made a commitment to provide volunteers for five years to help us with some of our work. <\/p><p> I referred to under-reporting of domestic violence.  Derry has the highest rate of reporting in Northern Ireland because we reviewed services and took a creative approach to how we reach women.<\/p><p> In terms of housing, we have built 16 houses on the site and we have another site with nine apartments.  The women will be housed at these locations.  This was done on a business model under which we acquired land, negotiated with government and resold it.  We have a treatment centre, which will open in Derry in September.  I invite members to visit the centre, which will offer programmes and courses as well as child care facilities.  We will receive direct referrals from social services and we also have workers in one of the police stations.  This is how we receive referrals of sexual violence cases.  The model is based on a model I observed in Boston.  Women may not speak about rape to police officers but many will speak to women's advocates on site in a police station.  We are required by law to report crimes and we inform women that we must report any crimes to the police.  Increasingly, women are starting to come forward.  Our criminal justice workers are available to support the families in question in the process.  One of the major shortcomings of the process is that women tend to fall out of the process if they are not kept fully informed or if supports are withdrawn.<\/p><p> There is also a great deal of intimidation.  The dissident threat is alive and well.  In some communities in Northern Ireland it is not considered acceptable for people to go forward to the police.  Those who do so will feel intimidated and threatened.  We have to get past this obstacle.  This is the reason I would like to bring the police in with other agencies.  Derry has the only domestic violence unit in Northern Ireland.  Having campaigned for and secured this unit, I would like the police who are involved in it to work alongside their colleagues in social services and victim support.  There is no limit to what we want.  Whatever needs women identify, we want them to be made available.  The domestic violence unit is already in place; it is simply a matter of providing a place for it in the building.  The statutory agencies' role is to pay the rent and maintain the building.  We would have victim support and the different agencies in place. <\/p><p> There are still dissident and community threats.  Some of this involves the obvious physical threat from dissidents, while in other respects it is a much more cloaked threat.  One needs to be careful where one puts money into communities.  We need to ensure communities do not start to deal with these issues alone.  These problems must not be buried in communities as this would create ghettos in which the problems would become worse.  That is my concern.  For this reason, we need to have a neutral building and accessible policing.  This means people should not have to pass through four security gates and barricades to enter a police station before having to give their name in a loud voice. <\/p> <p>One would be seen on the street outside when one was going in and one could be asked, \"Are you an informer?\"  Those are the real barriers to going into a police station.  If we take them out and put police in with their colleagues and start to normalise the position, then communities will become normalised in turn because people will be able to walk in off the street.<\/p><p> Reference was made to trafficked women.  There are also women who are in forced marriages.  Such marriages are happening in Northern Ireland and we keep a register in respect of them.  Any woman who is leaving the country can register the fact that she is doing so and where she has been.  Those are the issues which are emerging.  We have new communities coming into Northern Ireland and we quickly need to come to terms with some of the issues that arise for these families if we are to get a grip on matters.  We need to do this soon before areas become controlled, meaning that families cannot get out.  I sit on the policing partnership in Derry and the latest matter with which it dealt related to ten year olds.  Community representatives were chastising parents about their children being on the streets and social services became involved.  That is not a matter with which community representatives with no training should be dealing.  It is, rather, for the relevant agencies and the justice centres to consider issues relating to families with problems.<\/p><p> We have a range of training, we are involved in schools and we have healthy relationships with those with whom we work.  We have a great deal of work which is ongoing.  We were in Galway recently doing some joint work with the people there and we shared information on how we operate.  That is our view in terms of the justice centre.  Central to that will be the voices forum.  We will always invite women to the voices forum in order that they might evaluate matters for us, provide feedback in respect of what is missing and what should be included and outline their experiences.  Women are central to all of this.  I really believe that the police in America would not have invested money in this if there was a possibility that it would not work.  Family justice centres are springing up right across the US.  They are invest-to-save models and we will definitely share resources.  However, we can also be more creative in what we develop for families because we will have access to joint expertise.  We will get to know each other's boundaries.  Part of the design of the justice centres is that they are open-plan.  Dividing walls and separate offices are not allowed.  It is not just about co-location.<\/p><p> We are working with the Strathclyde police in Scotland, which has a very impressive record in respect of domestic violence.  Their chief inspector visited us and stated that one would have to have three heads in order to work in the domestic violence area in Northern Ireland.  He saw the difficulties involved and was shocked at the state of the police station.  He said, \"No victim alive would go in there.  How can you operate?\"  I informed him how we do so.  The Strathclyde police have co-located with victim services in Scotland and we are meeting with them and examining their toolkit.  It will not be just about the American model; we will also consider best practice from elsewhere and transfer it to our centre.  If we have that, then we can try to share it right across the board.  We cover particular areas but women everywhere can contact us and we will link them with services in or near their own areas.  We will also provide advice.  There are men who also suffer.  For example, some men have experienced sexual violence.  This will also provide an opportunity for them to come forward.  When they do so, they require immediate support and access to proper expertise.  That is what we hope the justice centre will provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600010#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Brown","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368705600,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Am I correct in thinking that the residential element of the facility is in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600012#L00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368705600,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Brown"},{"type":"speech","time":1368705600,"counter":739,"content":"<p>Is it the case that the family justice centre will provide services rather than-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600012#L00400","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368705600,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013051600012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Brown"},{"type":"speech","time":1368705600,"counter":741,"content":"<p>The overall project should not, therefore, be as daunting a prospect.

This will enable those on the front line to come up to speed.  Any agency can refer people on to any or all of the facilities we have managed to put in place.  We just received &pound;500,000 from the lottery in order to examine the position with regard to anti-social behaviour and acting out among ten to 18 year olds.  That anti-social behaviour stems from children living with violence and also from the fact that there is a perception about an acceptable level of violence in the street.  These children know nothing else.  We are really starting to look at helping them cope with some of the violence with which they have grown up.  We are also examining different ways of approaching how they behave and considering other anti-violence work.<\/p><p>  The treatment centre will be completed in June and will open in September.
