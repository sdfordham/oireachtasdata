These priorities include the drawing up and publication of an Action Plan on the housing crisis.  The priorities in this key area and any funding requirements in 2016 and 2017 will be addressed in that context. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">The need for enhanced engagement by the Oireachtas in the budgetary process is highlighted in the Programme for Government, with a number of specific commitments aimed at ensuring the Oireachtas has a more participatory role in the budget process and can contribute their views to the formulation of budgetary policy.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">Having regard to the current stage of the budgetary cycle, the first element of the proposed new approach for 2016 is the publication of the Government's Summer Economic Statement (&quot;SES&quot;) in June.  This statement will provide an updated assessment of the macro-economic and fiscal prospects.  The intention is that the SES would include  an updated forecast on the available fiscal space to enable the Oireachtas Committees to conduct fully informed discussions on budgetary priorities for 2017. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">As part of the proposed new arrangements in respect of the budget process, it is also proposed that the Government publish a Mid-Year Expenditure Report.  It is envisaged that this Report would set out revised end-year outturns for 2016 outlining the impact of any additional expenditure this year on Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings for 2016 and 2017.  This, along with the detail on fiscal space provided in the SES, will support Oireachtas consultation and engagement on the costing of specific measures intended to respond to particular Programme for Government priorities.  Details in relation to tax issues are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100050#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Expenditure Policy","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100050#WRB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[12598\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100050#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has raised concerns with the Department of Finance regarding the tax cuts promised over the next five years; his views on the ratio of tax cuts to public investment promised in budget 2016, particularly given that Ireland has the third lowest level of public expenditure in the Eueopean Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p><font color=\"#181818\">As outlined in the Programme for Government, the Government is committed to boosting public expenditure in a sustainable way and will introduce budgets that will involve at least a 2:1 split between investment in public spending and tax reductions.  This will allow expenditure to be increased to meet the additional costs arising from an ageing and growing population and to provide for targeted improvements in public services.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">The Programme for Government recognises that economic and social progress go hand in hand.  Only a strong economy supporting people at work can pay for the services needed to create a fair society.  The Programme for Government, therefore, sets out a clear strategy for increasing spending in a sustainable way built on stable revenues.  A key focus of the Government is on providing the best environment for job creation.  Much progress has been made in recent years with significant growth in the numbers at work.  Unemployment has fallen from a peak of over 15% to a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for April this year of 7.9%.  The Government's ambition is to help create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, including 135,000 outside of Dublin. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#181818\">When comparing investment in public services relative to the rest of the European Union, account needs to be taken of the impact the economic crisis had on the public finances.  In addition, the Deputy will also be aware that the basis for the comparison can have a significant impact.  Expenditure compared against GDP, GNP or a hybrid of the two may give different results and, given Ireland's relatively young population, adjusting for the demographic profile of the population can also impact on the comparisons.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100050#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100050#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[12993\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100050#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"to expedite the restoration of pay and pay equality for public servants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p><font color=\"#181818\">From the period 2009 to 2013 the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts introduced pay reduction measures.

Submissions received as part of that process informed the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which was published in July 2013.  As part of the follow-up to that initiative, in November 2013 the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders who reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard, in particular, to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision.  The Group also examined mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and address practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently progressing a three Phase consultation process with a view to putting a new Disability Inclusion Strategy in place.  Phase 2, which focused on agreeing high-level objectives for the Strategy, was completed at the end of 2015.  Phase 3 will involve agreeing specific actions with timescales to deliver on each of the high-level objectives.  This will commence shortly.  I expect to have a set of draft actions for the Strategy for publication shortly.  The consultations on this draft will include consideration by the National Disability Strategy Steering Group and, as with Phase 2, a series of regional consultation meetings.  The Strategy will then be revised as necessary and submitted to Government for final approval. <\/p>  <p>  Issues in relation to the Deaf Community have featured strongly in the consultation process to date and I intend that the new Disability Inclusion Strategy will respond credibly to the issues raised, including making a real difference in relation to facilitating the use of Irish Sign Language and ensuring that public bodies provide ISL users with ISL interpretation when availing of their statutory services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100051#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coroners Service","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100051#WRC03150"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[12777\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100051#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"how unclaimed deceased remains are treated by the State; the laws which govern the burial of deceased persons whose remains are unclaimed by family members or relatives; the annual figures of unclaimed deceased here over the past decade; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>The legislation governing Coroners is the Coroners Act, 1962.

As part of the follow-up to that initiative, in November 2013 the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders who reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard, in particular, to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision.

However, as the Deputy will be aware, we have had a dedicated Drug Treatment Court operating in Ireland for some time now.  This is a problem solving court and makes an important contribution, not least as an alternative to prison.  The Drug Treatment Court operates on the basis that a criminal matter has not proceeded to formal conviction and the presiding Judge reviews matters at each adjournment, frequently over an extended period of time, to assess progress, before the matter before the Court is eventually finalised.  The catchment area served by the Drug Treatment Court was significantly expanded in July 2013 to encompass the whole of County Dublin and the programme has also found a way to facilitate participants from outside of Dublin, with participants from Portlaoise and Cork being admitted in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Drug Treatment Court, courts in Ireland place several thousand defendants every year under the supervision of the Probation Service in the community, either without proceeding to conviction or post-conviction.  Defendants can be placed on Probation Orders or supervised by Probation Officers during deferment of penalty.  Both of these sanctions operate without proceeding to conviction and the defendant can be called back to Court to answer the original matter, if they fail to comply with supervision.  Courts also have a number of other sanctions, incorporating supervision in the community by a Probation Officer, available to them as a post-conviction measure.  These are Community Service Orders, fully suspended sentences with supervision and part-suspended sentence Supervision Orders and post-release Supervision Orders.  Constitutionally, any post-conviction review is not possible.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has led a Working Group of Justice Sector officials to consider options for moving forward on the proposal to establish a Community Court which is a problem-solving court. Building on the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, the Working Group has been considering proposals to enhance our approach to tackling low level offenders and effectively addressing their offending behaviour through a Community Justice Intervention type programme.  This would be a diversion from the courts system and would build on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Adult Cautioning Scheme which has the potential to respond more effectively to one-off and repeat, low level offending with the emphasis on speedy processing aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending and would also offer quick referral to the necessary services.

My officials will shortly be in contact with the Policing Authority with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements for the review and I will ensure that the outcome of the review is put before the House.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that some 139 Garda stations were closed on foot of the implementation of the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme, which was implemented in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.  As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  It concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the estimated savings on utilities and maintenance as a result of the closure of each station building is approximately &euro;4,000 per annum giving an estimated total saving to the state of &euro;556,000 per annum.  I am advised that compiling a report in relation to the cost of reopening each and every station closed would involve a disproportionate amount of time and resources.  However, I would stress that the key objective involved when closing Garda stations was to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  <\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the beneficial outcomes that have accrued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising from the Station Rationalisation Programme, the Programme for Government recognises that there is a need for a review along the lines that I have outlined to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100052#WRD04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[11900\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she is taking to speed up the resettlement of refugees in Ireland through relocation and resettlement programmes given that Ireland has taken only a small number of refugees over the past year out of the 4,000 agreed; and the consideration that has been given to increasing the number of refugees Ireland has agreed to resettle, given that the global refugee crisis is continuing to worsen.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that under last September's Government decision which established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), approximately 2,600 asylum seekers are to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU relocation programme and 520 refugees are being taken in from Lebanon under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement programme.

When these developments are complete the practice of slopping out will have been completely eradicated from all of the prison estate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[12565\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current annual budget and annual rental costs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>The budget for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate for 2016 is &euro;1,255,000 of which &euro;83,640 relates to rental costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Legal Aid","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[12572\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100053#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of reducing the application fee for civil legal aid to &euro;100 and to &euro;50.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Legal Aid Board seeks a minimum contribution of &euro;30 for legal advice and &euro;130 for legal aid (which includes the advice contribution of &euro;30).

The visiting room now consists of eight round tables with four chairs around each in a warm and colourful environment, prisoners on standard regime have access to this style of visit.  Limerick Prison has also established a &lsquo;family room&rsquo; which is available to prisoners on an enhanced regime. <\/p>  <p>  Limerick Prison has worked closely with the Irish Prison Service Training College and the Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) in developing and delivering a number of learning and development programmes.  Training have been delivered to over 40 staff to include: (1) 'Front-of-House' training to improve customer service, and increase awareness of the challenges faced by families with a loved one in custody; (2) Family Liaison Officer training to support the prisoners in their role as parents and to co-deliver the Parents Plus parenting course to prisoners; and, (3) Children First awareness training.  Further staff training is planned for the second quarter of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Parents Plus Charity and Childhood Development Initiative have worked with the Irish Prison Service to tailor the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme to meet the need of parents in prison.  Family Liaison Officers in Limerick Prison facilitate parenting skills course for prisoners, and &lsquo;Bedford Row&rsquo; charity works simultaneously to deliver the parenting programme in the community.  This programme has been successfully delivered to 24 prisoners.  A review of the 'Parents Plus' programme by University of Limerick is currently underway which will inform future development.  <\/p>  <p>  Further small capital projects are underway to enhance visit facilities across the prison estate.  Funding was awarded to St. Vincent de Paul to extend their Visitor Centre facilities to Wheatfield Prison.  The Irish Prison Service has recently allocated funding to appoint a Family Links Coordinator and to extend the Family Links model to Wheatfield Prison in 2016 and Cork Prison in 2017.  This will commence with staff training for Wheatfield Prison staff in Summer 2016 and delivery of the first 'Parents Plus' parenting programme in partnership with Tusla to families in Wheatfield Prison in Autumn 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[12676\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to provide an open prison for female prisoners and to increase open prison provision for male prisoners.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>In the joint Probation Service\/Irish Prison Service Women's Strategy 2014 - 2016, An Effective Response to Women Who Offend, published in 2014, the Irish Prison Service made a commitment to explore the development of an open centre\/open conditions for women assessed as low risk of re-offending.<\/p>  <p>  This commitment was acknowledged in the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy who also recommended that a greater focus on step down facilities, supported accommodation, use of more community based open conditions for female offenders and the provision of an open centre for women.  <\/p>  <p>  A joint Irish Prison Service\/Probation Service working group considered an open centre for women and decided to recommend, rather than developing an open centre for women, that a more practical and cost effective way to address the deficit is to pursue step down facilities for women.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I have given approval to the Heads of the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to proceed to scope the possibilities for the development of step down units for female offenders and female ex-offenders.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to increase open prison provision for male prisoners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Releases","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG01550"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[12677\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to remove exclusions from temporary release for all categories of prisoner.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release is set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003. <\/p>  <p>  In September 2014 I published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy.

This involves an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work in a supervised group setting.

Prior to the first sitting of Second Special Criminal Court, the waiting time for the hearing of cases, indicated to be ready for trial, was 24 months.  This has now been reduced to 18 months and, as the two Special Criminal Courts continue to sit, the waiting times will continue to reduce.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a Second Special Criminal Court does not necessarily mean that more cases will be referred to the Special Criminal Courts but that cases will be dealt with more quickly.  The Deputy will be aware that the decision as to whether a particular case will be prosecuted before the Special Criminal Court is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is, by law, independent of the Government.  There have been calls for the abolition of the Special Criminal Court, including by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, but the Government is not prepared to consider such a step at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coroners Service","counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[12698\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will introduce legislation to update the coroner system and to ensure mechanisms of investigation into deaths in prison custody are compliant with Ireland's international human rights obligations.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>In relation to the investigation of deaths in prison custody, since 1 January, 2012, the death of any prisoner in custody or on temporary release is the subject of an independent investigation by the Inspector of Prisons.  The Deputy will be aware that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory independent office established under the Prisons Act, 2007.  All death in custody reports are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  The Inspector&rsquo;s investigations and reports are part of a three pronged process &ndash; the other aspects being the investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the investigations and Inquests conducted by the Coroners.  I am satisfied that this process ensures that Ireland is in compliance with its national and international obligations regarding deaths in prison custody, and meets the strict criteria laid down by the European Court of Human Rights when interpreting the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the circumstances of each death in custody are subject to an internal review process by the suicide prevention group for the prison institution concerned.  This group is chaired by the respective prison Governors, and includes representatives from all the services across the prison estate, including medical, psychology, chaplaincy, probation, education, and prison staff.  The internal review fully covers the background and circumstances of each death in custody, and its objective is to identify any possible measures which may be implemented which can contribute to a reduced risk of deaths in custody in future. <\/p>  <p>  The Internal Review Reports are considered by the National Suicide and Harm Prevention Steering Group, which is chaired by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service.  The Steering Group then ensures that the relevant findings of those reports are disseminated throughout the prison system.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the coroner system, the Coroners Bill 2007 is already under review in my Department at my request, as elements of that Bill have become outdated.  However, changes have already been introduced in relation to an inquest, where the person has died in prison custody or immediately after being in prison custody. Part 6 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, which amended the Coroners Act 1962 and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, provides for  legal aid to be available to the deceased's next of kin so that they can be legally represented at the coroner's inquest where the person has died in, or immediately after being in, State custody.  <\/p>  <p>  This responds to the importance under the European Convention on Human Rights of ensuring that the next of kin can effectively participate and engage in the inquest process in such cases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":395,"content":"<p>Question No. 171 answered with Question No. 127.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG03850"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[12700\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the resources she has allocated to integrated sentence management in prisons to deliver prisoner centred rehabilitation.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a total of 24 dedicated Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are operational in all prisons and open centres since March 2015.  The allocation of dedicated staff in each establishment greatly enhances the effectiveness of the sentence management system and facilitates the growing numbers of prisoners participating in the process.  These 24 Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are further supported by prison management and the prison-based multi-disciplinary team, which includes the Psychology Service, the Education Service, the Work Training Service, the Chaplaincy Service, the Probation Service, the Resettlement Service, the Addiction Service and the prison Healthcare team.<\/p>  <p>  Newly committed prisoners with a sentence of greater than one year are eligible to take part in Integrated Sentence Management.  This involves a specific orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners with an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  <\/p>  <p>  The Integrated Sentence Management process is a prisoner-centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners, with provision for initial assessment, goal-setting and periodic review to measure progress.  Important issues such as accommodation, employment and education are addressed to help the prisoner resettle into the community on release and reduce the risk of re-offending. <\/p>  <p>  Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are also active participants in sentence planning for certain categories of prisoners serving less than one year, for example, female prisoners, prisoners who have declared their risk of homelessness on release, or prisoners participating in the Community Support Scheme.

In January 2016, the Irish Prison Service introduced a new central information platform on the Prisoner Information Management System (PIMS) where both Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators and members of the multi-disciplinary team can record a range of information with regard to ongoing sentence management for individual prisoners and raise post-release concerns.  This centralised information-sharing resource will assist prison-based services to improve the transition from custody to the community for offenders with the overall aim of reducing risk to the individual and reducing risk of re-offending post-release. <\/p>  <p>  The current Integrated Sentence Management policy is currently under review by the Irish Prison Service in order to improve service delivery to individual prisoners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100055#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"White Collar Crime","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100056#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[12701\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100056#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the use of the equitable remedy of disgorgement as a supplementary measure to possible criminal penalties in white collar crime cases.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy's question to refer generally to the question of whether legislation is available or is proposed that allows for the confiscation of the benefits derived from criminal conduct.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to legislation within the remit of my Department, I can inform the Deputy that the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 set out the law in relation to the confiscation of benefits derived from criminal conduct following conviction on indictment in the Circuit Court.

This prohibition is restated in the International Protection Act 2015 which is expected to be commenced later this year.  The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined by giving immigrants who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum, the same access to employment as immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment.  There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.  Any change in public policy with regard to 'right to work' would also have to have regard to the unemployment situation pertaining in the State at any given time.  I would point out that the International Protection Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system. Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers (McMahon Report), has implications for a number of Government Departments and services.  The 173 recommendations in the Report were taken forward by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  To date, some 90 of the recommendations have been fully implemented and more than 30 others are in the process of being implemented.  Work on implementing a further number of the recommendations is continuing.  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.   <\/p>  <p>  At the end of April 2016 there were 4,486 persons residing in Direct Provision accommodation of which 1,170 were under the age of 18.  The median processing time in respect of asylum decisions taken during the period 1 January 2016 to 30 April 2016 for those in Direct Provision accommodation was 25 months approximately.  This is an improvement of over 3 months on the median processing time applicable over the period 1 January 2015 to 30 April 2016.  In addition, and in line with the recommendations in the Working Group Report, a concerted effort has been made to process cases of those over 5 years in the system.  Of those in this category, the majority either have been granted status and will transition out of the system or have a Deportation Order issued against them and are thus required to remove themselves from the State.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the total amount paid for direct provision accommodation was &euro;53.143m.  As the Reception and Integration Agency is currently engaged in a tendering process for the provision of services at the seven State owned accommodation centres, it is not considered prudent to provide any further breakdown of the total figure provided at this time.

I want to assure the Deputy that the new Garda training programme and new supervisory arrangements which are now in place should ensure that, as far as possible, there should be no recurrence of the types of incidents which feature in the O'Higgins report, including the matters raised by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that under current operational regulations for the Garda&iacute;, the daily performance accountability and learning framework, meetings take place at which incidents occurring in the previous 24 hours are discussed with the District Superintendent or the Inspector on his or her behalf and with Garda&iacute; and supervisors.  Directions and instructions are provided on matters under investigation.  It is a much more collaborative and inclusive reporting and accountability mechanism. In a further recent development, a nominated supervisor is now allocated to all matters under investigation.  Required actions are marked on associated PULSE incidents under investigation and must be attended to by investigating Garda&iacute;.  All incidents are reviewed by managers to ensure all actions and investigations are progressed. <\/p>  <p>  Since I reopened the Garda College in September 2014, all Garda recruits undertake the new two-year training programme leading to a Bachelor of Arts in Applied Policing, accredited by the University of Limerick.  This programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and exemplifies best practice.  Phase one, which lasts 32 weeks, is based in the Garda College and places a strong emphasis on problem-based learning, with students learning in small groups through engagement with realistic policing scenarios.  Phase two, which lasts for 65 weeks, is primarily based in Garda stations, with appropriate training and development structures in place, including access to a trained tutor Garda and a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who are thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  During the course of their placement, trainees move through three development stages - assisting their Garda tutors, taking the lead role and being assisted by the tutors, and finally the autonomous stage, in which they are deployed in regular policing activity and work independently within the operational unit.  Over the course of the placement, Garda&iacute; also return to the Garda College for a number of weeks to further enhance their skills in specialist areas, including sexual assault, intelligence-led policing, file preparation and court presentation.  Phase three consists of seven weeks of preparation for final exams and assessments.<\/p>  <p>  While these new training and supervision arrangements are core to addressing the shortcomings which Mr Justice O'Higgins found, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the Report of the O'Higgins Commission and to indicate to me what further measures might be taken to prevent the type of difficulties outlined in it in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising again and her proposals to respond to the  recommendations which are related to the Garda service.  I await the Garda Commissioner's response to the report which is likely to assist with the identification of further measures to ensure that our citizens can enjoy effective policing. <\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority received a copy of the report in the context of its statutory role in relation to oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Authority and the Garda Commissioner held their first meeting regarding the Report on 26 May 2016 and further meetings are planned, including two public meetings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100057#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100057#WRJ02250"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[12958\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100057#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"for an update on the development of terms of reference for the inquiry into Garda misconduct allegations made by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>The matter to which the Deputy refers was considered by the Independent Review Mechanism (IRM) set up by the Government to review complaints of Garda misconduct which had been made to the Taoiseach and myself.

This was an important legislative change, as it introduced a new power for the courts to approve and impose a personal insolvency proposal made by a borrower which has been rejected by the creditors, provided that the judge considers, using criteria set out in s. 115A, that the proposal is fair and reasonable to all concerned. <\/p><p>Under this provision, an application  for the new court review can be made by an insolvent person who has proposed a personal insolvency arrangement, if the proposal:<\/p><p>- has been refused by their creditors,<\/p><p>- includes a mortgage, or other debt, whose payment is secured on the borrower's home (their principal private residence, as defined in the Personal Insolvency Acts),<\/p><p>- and the borrower was in arrears on that mortgage or other debt on 1 January 2015 (<i>or<\/i>on that date was in a restructure of such arrears, but remains insolvent.)<\/p><p>The appropriate Court for hearing the review applications is normally the Circuit Court, where the cases are heard by the specialist personal insolvency judges.  Under the amending Act, all applications to court for this review, and their outcomes, must be notified to the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI).  The ISI has indicated that it intends to publish overall details of the s. 115A applications on a regular basis. <\/p><p>The new provision was commenced with effect from 20 November 2016, after the necessary changes to the relevant Rules of Court had been put in place. As of 24 May 2016, the ISI advises that 46 review applications to Court have been notified to the ISI.  The courts had decided 5 applications - in 4 of these, the borrower's proposal was approved by the Court, while in 1, it was rejected by the Court.  5 further cases had been withdrawn while 2 had been struck out by consent: these outcomes can result from settlement negotiations between the parties.  34 other applications were before the Courts: in 32 of these, the Court has held an initial hearing but new affidavits or additional material had been requested and adjournments have been given to allow for filing of this material in advance of a full hearing.  The remaining 2 cases were awaiting an initial hearing. <\/p><p>A further relevant development is the new Scheme of Access to Independent Legal and Financial Advice for Home Mortgage Arrears, which I announced on 22 January and which is expected to come into operation very shortly.  The objective of the Scheme is to ensure that an insolvent borrower at risk of losing his or her home due to mortgage arrears can get the necessary expert advice and help to identify their best option to resolve their financial difficulties.  MABS, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, will act as gateway to the Scheme and will be able to refer the borrower to  a personal insolvency practitioner, solicitor or accountant if needed, without cost to the insolvent borrower and at fixed cost to the Scheme.  The Scheme includes, in particular, a component to ensure that an insolvent borrower can access expert financial assistance and legal aid for seeking the new Court review, where needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100057#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100057#WRJ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[12965\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100057#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is aware of  an alleged speeding offence that was entered on the PULSE - police using leading systems effectively - system (details supplied) and of the circumstances in which it was not pursued but no justification was given for this decision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

To ensure sufficient progress towards this objective, annual targets were set for the headline deficit between 2010 and 2015.  The Council Recommendation did not specify annual targets for the structural balance for Ireland, although a cumulative structural improvement over 2011 to 2015 was required.  The 2016 Stability Programme Update, published 27 April, included an estimate that the structural balance improved by 0.9 percentage points (pp) of GDP in 2015.  Outturn data show that Ireland has reduced its headline deficit to 2.3 %\u00a0of GDP in 2015 (or 1.3 % of GDP on an underlying basis).  On this basis, the European Commission has issued a recommendation for a Council Decision to abrogate Ireland's EDP procedure.<\/p>  <p>  Following our exit from the EDP, Ireland will be subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Under the preventive arm, the required minimum pace of structural budgetary adjustment is predetermined on the basis of cyclical conditions in Member States.  In both 2016 and 2017, Ireland is required to deliver an improvement of 0.6pp in the structural balance of GDP, as required under 'normal' cyclical conditions.  These requirements have been set or 'frozen' on the basis of European Commission estimates of the output gap\u00a0for these years outlined\u00a0its Spring forecast exercise conducted in 2015 and 2016 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  On an ex-ante basis, for 2016, my Department projects an improvement in the structural balance of 0.4pp of GDP.  While this is below the required improvement, the deviation of 0.2pp of GDP is not considered significant in the fiscal framework.  Furthermore, on the basis of its analysis contained in its assessment of our Stability Programme Update, the Commission deems Ireland to be compliant in 2016 on an ex-ante basis with the second pillar of assessment considered under the preventive arm the expenditure benchmark.  On a no-policy change basis, as set out in the Stability Programme Update, my Department projects a structural budgetary improvement of 1.2 per cent of GDP for 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100058#WRK03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100058#WRK03650"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[12548\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100058#WRK03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the funding or tax reliefs available to a person to deal with the continuous blockage and overflow of sewerage pipes in a private garden.","asker":"1222","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>Some assistance for the relevant householders may be provided by the Home Renovation Incentive, which\u00a0was introduced\u00a0in Budget 2014.

This increased the general government expenditure for 2015 on a one-off basis by c.&euro;2.1 billion and worsened the general government deficit for 2015\u00a0by about 1% of GDP.  Excluding this one-off transaction, the deficit was 1.3% of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  Compliance with the expenditure benchmark is calculated by comparing the year-on-year change in general government expenditure, excluding certain items such interest expenditure,\u00a0and there is no provision for the exclusion of one-off transactions.

The second pillar is the balanced budget rule, which requires a Member State to move towards its medium-term budgetary objective or MTO in accordance with its adjustment path.  The MTO is set in structural terms, which means it excludes the effects of the economic cycle and one-off transactions, such as the AIB transaction in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing compliance with the preventive arm of the SGP, the European Commission undertakes an overall assessment based on both pillars.\u00a0 Given the one-off issue, it is possible that the Commission will place greater emphasis on the\u00a0structural balance pillar for 2016 and not the expenditure benchmark as would normally be the case.

Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date.  The Revenue Commissioners take the view that land on which a wind turbine is installed is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test.  Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by wind turbines (and not merely subject to an option over the land), the use of agricultural land for wind turbines may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance.  It is unlikely that the ability to farm the land would be affected by the granting of an option over the land to a wind turbine developer or the registration of a burden over the land with the Land Registry.  However, the ability to farm the land would be affected where the option is exercised by the wind turbine developer and a wind turbine is actually installed.  As it would not generally be possible to farm any part of the land occupied by wind turbines, the change in the use of land from farming to the generation of energy within the required 6-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100059#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100059#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[12801\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100059#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 160 of 6 April 2016, if the circa 11% figure given for a bank (details supplied) is a figure for the amount of new mortgage loans that are counted as exceptions under the Central Bank's loan to value rules or if they are the figure for exemptions, switchers, negative equity and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the lender referred to in your question that the 11% quoted represents the amount of new mortgage loans that are considered as exceptions under the Central Bank of Ireland's macro prudential rules and does not include any exemptions for, for example, switchers or negative equity customers. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also\u00a0be aware that, in relation\u00a0to the review\u00a0of the macro prudential measurers for residential mortgage lending, the Central Bank has informed me this will take place later this year with publication expected in November. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that, while the general framework of mortgage rules is intended to be a permanent feature, arising from this forthcoming review the calibration of these rules can be tightened, loosened or left unchanged in response to its analysis of the operation of these rules from inception through summer 2016.

Firstly, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the fiscal rules investment in capital formation is granted favourable treatment. \u00a0Within the rules spending on capital formation is smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in investment for capital formation purposes must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space available under the expenditure benchmark.  This provision demonstrates that the rules are designed to actively promote public investment and capital spending.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, the loosening of the medium term budgetary objective (MTO) to which Ireland is subject results in an additional &euro;1.5 billion in fiscal space becoming available once the MTO is achieved.  Taking account of this, together with the benefit of the capital smoothing treatment explained above, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to deliver an additional cumulative &euro;4 billion in capital spending.  We are also leveraging additional funding to invest in the development and construction of housing.  The joint venture fund Activate Capital established by Ireland's Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is a strong example of such a commitment.<\/p>  <p>  The second source of flexibility - and that to which the Deputy refers - \u00a0is the 'investment clause' provision within the Stability and Growth Pact. \u00a0Subject to meeting certain eligibility criteria temporary leniency may be granted with regard to the required pace of structural budgetary adjustment.

Of course, these are proportionate thresholds and individual banks have a\u00a0certain flexibility to provide a limited amount of lending at higher LTV thresholds subject to also meeting consumer protection requirements and having satisfying themselves that the consumer borrower is likely to be in a position to meet\u00a0the obligations of the credit agreement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank\u00a0will carry out a review of the current macro prudential rules later this year with publication expected in November.\u00a0 To that end, the Bank has indicated that the existing rules can be recalibrated if the\u00a0evidence\u00a0suggests that such an adjustment\u00a0would be warranted.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, an overriding primary policy objective in the area of housing is to deliver affordable and sustainable housing and credit markets over the course of the economic cycle and to avoid the boom and bust cycles which we have experienced in the past.\u00a0 The macro prudential policy framework put in place by the Central Bank is\u00a0intended to help achieve that objective.\u00a0\u00a0From a financial stability perspective, mortgage insurance needs to\u00a0effectively transfer\u00a0risk away from the banking system and from the State in a cost effective way (and to do so without\u00a0giving rise to stability concerns elsewhere in the financial system)\u00a0while also\u00a0operating in the best interest of consumers.\u00a0\u00a0Due to this\u00a0imperative\u00a0to effectively transfer risk, I would not see a role for the State\u00a0in underwriting, or guaranteeing the provision of, mortgage default insurance in relation to high LTV residential mortgages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100059#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100059#WRL03000"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[13416\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100059#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he will take to address the high cost of motor insurance for young drivers;

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.

In that regard, the procedures outline that schools are required under equality legislation to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to prevent harassment and sexual harassment.  Equality legislation prohibits harassment on any of the nine grounds: gender including transgender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.

The child protection procedures recognise that in some cases potentially abusive behaviour occurs between children and schools are required to follow the guidance provided in Children First on the identification of and reporting of such cases.  In accordance with Children First, the procedures for schools require that if school personnel have concerns that children may have been abused or neglected, or are being abused or neglected, or are at risk of abuse or neglect, the matter shall, including where the alleged perpetrator is another child, be reported without delay to the Child and Family Agency.<\/p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 when commenced, will put key elements of Children First on a statutory basis.

Following consideration of their recommendations and consultation with stakeholders on implementation arrangements, an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published in June 2014.  A key recommendation of this review was the establishment of an Apprenticeship Council.  The Council was established in November 2014 and its first task was to issue a call for proposals for new apprenticeships from consortia of industry bodies and education and training providers.  Over 80 proposals were received, all of which were evaluated against a set of criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The Council assigned category 1 status to 25 proposals which were deemed to be at an advanced stage of design, planning and collaboration between education and industry and ready to enter a detailed development phase. The Council is working closely with consortia within this group to develop them into sustainable national apprenticeships.  It is envisaged that up to nine of these will be in a position to move to enrolment in 2016 and that the remainder will be rolled out in 2017.  The Council is also working with the other consortia to ensure that a strong pipeline of new apprenticeships is in place.<\/p>  <p>  In the Programme for Partnership Government we have committed to double the number of apprenticeships by 2020.  We will target over 100 different apprenticeship schemes spread across sectors of the economy and in every region of Ireland.

The SEC provides a rationale for its decisions in refusing accommodations where these are not warranted at the initial decision stage.  Candidates who are unhappy with the SEC's decision following consideration of their application for support have a right of appeal to an Independent Appeals Committee.  However, it has been the case that a decision rationale was not also provided to appeal applicants following an unsuccessful appeal to the Independent Appeals Committee.  Applicants not satisfied with the decision of the Independent Appeals Committee can apply to the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children to consider their complaint.<\/p>  <p>  A recent Judicial Review judgement in the High Court quashed a decision of the Independent Appeals Committee to refuse accommodations applied for by a candidate under the RACE scheme, as it did not give any reason for the Committee's decision.<\/p>  <p>  The SEC has advised me that it has taken the following steps in light of the High Court Judgement.  The SEC has assessed the implications of the judgement for all candidates for the 2016 examinations who had appealed the SEC decision not to award accommodations sought and whose appeal had come before the Committee prior to the date of the judgment.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, the Independent Appeals Committee reviewed the cases of the 81 appeals which clearly mirrored the situation of the candidate involved in the High Court case and last week notified the candidates involved, through their schools, of the accommodations which have now been granted.  Over the past week the Independent Appeals Committee has also reviewed the appeals of all others who had previously made an appeal to the Committee in order to confirm their initial decision and provide a written rationale for their decision to refuse accommodations in each case.<\/p>  <p>  This process is now complete and letters of decision have been issued to the candidates via their schools.  Of a total of 404 appeals heard by the Committee prior to the date of the judgement on 29th April, 57 had been granted in full by the Committee at first hearing; 81 have had some or all of the accommodations applied for allowed by the Committee in light of the Judicial Review judgement; the remaining 266 applicants have had their case reviewed by the Committee in light of the judgement; remain ineligible for supports but will receive a letter from the Committee setting out the reasons for their decision to refuse the appeal. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the SEC's review of these matters was not just confined to applications for readers; all previous appeals against decisions to refuse applications for reasonable accommodations have now been reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  Any new appeals which have come before the Independent Appeals Committee, since the date of the judgment, have been considered in light of the ruling and the Committee is now providing written reasons in respect of any decisions they make to refuse applications for reasonable accommodations.<\/p>  <p>  The Reasonable Accommodations scheme is demand led. It has not been subject to any budgetary cutbacks in recent years.  Supports are provided to any candidate who meets the conditions of eligibility for the accommodations applied for.<\/p>  <p>  Figures are not yet available for 2016 as the SEC continues to process late applications up to the start of and throughout the written examinations.

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. <\/p><p>Mission of Technological Universities:<\/p><p>The intention has always been that a Technological University would be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission relating to graduate formation, applied research and scholarship, dissemination of knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise with a very strong regional focus.  However, the mission of a university in Ireland as set out in the 1997 Universities Act is broad and comprehensive and as such it is not surprising that there may be some evidence of some elements of overlap between a University and an Institute of Technology or Technological University.<\/p><p>  This differentiated mission for a Technological University includes:-<\/p><p>- a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world,<\/p><p>- the advancement of knowledge through applied research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise, and <\/p><p>- the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located. <\/p><p>I would also like to underline that this is much more than a rebranding exercise &ndash; the institutions concerned are required to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities.  These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.<\/p><p>The following is a list of some of the key features expected of a Technological University: <\/p><p>- the range of teaching provision (levels 6-10), with the associated scope for progression via appropriate pathways; <\/p><p>- the strength of provision for work based, and lifelong, learning; <\/p><p>- the weight of postgraduate research activity relative to that in Institutes of Technology;<\/p><p>- the key role of experienced practitioners in teaching and research;<\/p><p>- very close employer links with involvement in curriculum design, teaching and supervision;<\/p><p>- a strong vocational\/professional orientation; <\/p><p>- a strong regional as well as a wider focus;<\/p><p>- highly developed responsiveness and flexibility in delivery, with demand (via feedback from employers) as a key driver; and<\/p><p>- an approach to research that entails building strength in focused areas in close partnership with users. <\/p><p>The mission and vision for each of the individual proposed technological universities is developed by the consortia, in consultation with stakeholders including staff and students, and is contained in the implementation plans subsequently developed.<\/p><p>Regional Focus:<\/p><p>There will also be a specific focus on the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.<\/p><p>International usage of the term Technological University:<\/p><p>As outlined in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 the purpose of the process for designation as a Technological University is &quot;...to fundamentally protect the core mission and orientation of the institutes and to simultaneously challenge the institutes that wish to be re-designated to demonstrate that they have reached new levels of performance on these fronts.&quot;<\/p><p>There is no standard use of the term technological university internationally.  In Europe many colleges previously known as polytechnics have become Universities of Applied Science (e.g. Finland and Netherlands).  They remain differentiated from traditional universities through their links to the labour market and strong emphasis on undergraduate rather than post-graduate activity. <\/p><p>In other jurisdictions there are Higher Education Institutions that appear similar in some respects to technological universities as envisaged for Ireland but are not known as technological universities (e.g. RMIT University, Melbourne Australia, or Swinburne University of Technology).<\/p><p>Consortiums who have applied:<\/p><p>As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. <\/p><p>The designation process consists of four stages as follows &ndash; <\/p><p>- an expression of interest, <\/p><p>- the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria, <\/p><p>- an evaluation of the plan, and <\/p><p>- an application for designation. <\/p><p>  There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). <\/p><p>Status of Consortia:<\/p><p>At the end of 2014, two consortia successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process.  These are the TU4Dublin consortium and the Munster Technological University consortium.<\/p><p>In early 2015 the Connacht-Ulster Alliance also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university.  This application was approved to proceed to the next stage.  In line with the process for designation as a Technological University, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.<\/p><p>With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was underway since September 2015, has recently been completed and a Report of the process was received by my Department on 13 May 2016.  There was strong engagement in the process by both parties.  This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.  As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.<\/p><p>In addition to this both Institutions made a recent joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement.  This was part of the latest call issued by the Higher Education Authority regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape.  The call sought submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.<\/p><p>Future Funding for landscape re-configuration in the Higher Education sector:<\/p><p>It is recognised that these changes to the landscape of Irish higher education carry some up-front additional costs and the HEA has provided for a fund to support HEIs with these costs.  In terms of additional financial support, having regard to the benefits that will arise for the institutions, students and the higher education system more generally, the HEA has provided funding in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to provide some support to institutions involved in the TU process, the details of which are set out for each consortium below.<\/p><p>In relation to 2016, the HEA have ring-fenced a level of funding to support costs arising from the continuation of landscape reform projects as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.  This funding, of up to &euro;8.7m in 2016, includes a specific &euro;2 million allocated in Budget 2016 to support Technological University projects.  This funding will be allocated by the HEA to the various landscape reform projects in due course.<\/p><p>The HEA has also invited further submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.  The total funding available in this call in 2015 will be c. &euro;3.75 million.  Not all of this funding is for Technological Universities as there are also other mergers taking place in Higher Education, i.e. NUIG\/ St. Angela's College, Sligo and DCU\/ St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra\/ Mater Dei Institute of Education.<\/p><p>  Costs:<\/p><p>Summary of Overall Costs to date and projections for 2016:<\/p><p>Costs incurred to End 2015 Estimate for 2016 Future projections<\/p><p>TU4 Dublin &euro;3,113,000 &euro;2,200,000 To be fully determined as part of the Stage 4 <\/p><p>Application process<\/p><p>MTU &euro;1,053,026 &euro;2,100,000 To be fully determined as part of the Stage 4 <\/p><p>Application process<\/p><p>TUSE &euro;495,655  To be fully determined as part of the Stage 2 <\/p><p>Application process<\/p><p>CUA &euro;400,000  To be fully determined as part of the Stage 2 Application process<\/p><p>Total &euro;5,061,681 &euro;4,300,000 <\/p><p>The process for designation as a Technological University consists of four stages.  The &quot;phase-gate&quot; model for the process allows for assessment of the projects at set points.  In relation to costs, these are considered during each stage of the process and in particular there is an onus on each consortium to develop financial models and estimated costings.  In terms of the financial costs, the two consortia that have finalised stage 3 and developed implementation plans acknowledge the costs involved in merger and the designation process, but also commit to meeting those costs within their own budgets.  They also acknowledge that while there are up-front costs in the shorter term, in the longer term, designation as a Technological University will allow them to recoup these costs and provide for new income streams.<\/p><p>In common with the Munster TU consortium, TU4Dublin has sought to ensure that cost estimates and projecting are robust.  It is essential to understand that, due to the complexity of both of these projects, cost estimates and projections must be continuously reviewed and revised as the project progresses. <\/p><p>Stage 4 Process:<\/p><p>Details of the Stage 4 process, including timeframes, for designation as a Technological University are set out in the Technological Universities Bill, 2015.  Sections 39 to 43 of the Bill set out the process for the making of an application to become a technological university, and the information which must be included in such an application, provide for the appointment of an independent, expert advisory panel to examine the application, for the provision by that panel of a report and recommendation to the HEA, and the subsequent provision by the HEA of the report, its views on the report and any other relevant information to the Minister.<\/p><p>Section 44 of the Bill provides for the making of a proposed decision by the Minister in relation to the application for Technological University status. <\/p><p>Position of Technological Universities Bill:<\/p><p>In relation to the position of the Technological Universities Bill, this Bill was at Report Stage at the time of dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il in February 2016.  I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100062#WRO04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Summer Works Scheme Applications","counter":824,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100062#WRO05000"},{"type":"question","counter":825,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[13357\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100062#WRO05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review the application by a school (details supplied) under the summer works scheme.","asker":"1342","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":826,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that details of the 197 successful school applicants in Categories 1 and 2 under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) were announced on 28th April last, details of which are also published on my Department's website,<i>www.education.i.e<\/i>.

In the case of cars taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2<\/sub>, the banding is structured so that higher emitting cars attract a higher rate of tax than lower emitting ones.

Accordingly, higher percentage increases have been applied to cars taxed on CO<sub>2<\/sub>in recent Budgets with a view to re-balancing the tax base while retaining an environmental incentive to purchase more environmentally friendly vehicles.  The percentage increase in motor tax for passenger vehicles taxed on engine capacity was 7.5% in Budgets 2012 and 2013, compared with increases averaging 25.5% in Budget 2012 and 19.8% in Budget 2013 for vehicles taxed on CO<sub>2<\/sub>.<\/p><p>The move to CO<sub>2<\/sub>has been effective in reducing emissions.  95% of all new vehicles purchased are now in the lowest emitting A and B bands, which attract the lowest tax rates.

Local authorities were canvassed for their views on these measures.<\/p><p>Several local authorities indicated that any restriction on the number of posters per candidate would be difficult to police effectively.  There were also concerns that restricting the number of posters per candidate would favour larger parties with several candidates running, while restricting the number of posters per party would disadvantage candidates with running mates.  Furthermore, there were concerns that any such measures would disadvantage first-time candidates and thus interfere with the democratic process.  Other concerns included the diverse geographical nature of constituencies, e.g. small urban versus large rural electoral districts.<\/p><p>  As a result, no measures were introduced to restrict the number of posters.  However, section 19(7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 was amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No.2) Act 2009 to introduce a 30-day time limit prior to an election taking place, during which election posters can be displayed.  Prior to this amendment, the relevant legislation had required that election posters be taken down within 7 days of an election but provided no time limit for the period prior to an election within which posters could be displayed.  While not dealing directly with the number of election posters on display, this legislation ensures that posters are only displayed for a finite and reasonable period.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that, overall, the existing arrangements are operating quite well and therefore have no plans in the short term to revise the legislation related to the erection of election posters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100064#WRQ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Expenditure","counter":939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100064#WRQ03150"},{"type":"question","counter":940,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[12765\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100064#WRQ03200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to provide a breakdown of the 1,477 social housing current expenditure programme units (details supplied) operational in 2015.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":941,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) (formally the Social Housing Leasing Initiative) was announced in February, 2009.

It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.<\/p><p>Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours.  This positions members of the public to engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites.<\/p><p>In addition, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which was enacted in September 2015, introduced a vacant site levy, aimed at incentivising the development of vacant and under-utilised sites in urban areas for residential or regeneration development. <\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Act , planning authorities are required to establish and maintain a register of vacant sites in their functional areas with effect from January 2017.

Emissions Trading is a &ldquo;Cap and Trade&rdquo; scheme whereby an EU wide limit or cap is set for participating installations.  The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions are reduced.  Within that limit &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; for emissions are auctioned or allocated for free.  Individual installations must report their CO2 emissions each year and surrender sufficient allowances to cover their emissions.  If their available allowances are exceeded an installation must purchase allowances.  If an installation has succeeded in reducing its emissions, it can sell its leftover allowances or keep these for a later period.<\/p><p>The ETS system is designed to bring about reductions in emissions at least cost, and to date has played an increasingly important role in assisting European industry implement the type of reductions envisaged in the EU Commission&rsquo;s limit of at least an overall 20 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2020.

A proposal for Phase Four, which will run from 2021 to 2030, was made by the European Commission in July 2015 and is currently being debated in the relevant committees and working parties of the European Parliament and Council.  Under Phases One and Two, all installations were entitled to some free allocation based on historical emissions.  The methodology is described in the National Allocation Plan as approved by Irish Government and the EU Commission.<\/p><p>Under Phase Three, there is no free allocation to the Power generating sector (except in ten of the newer Member States).  Free allocation to industries (and aircraft operators) is on the basis of EU- wide rules and benchmarks.  Verified production\/activity data gathered by EPA from the installations and aircraft operators is forwarded to the EU Commission as the basis of the free allocation application from operators of installations and aircraft.  The Commission approve a National Allocation Table and any amendments made to it subsequently as a result of closures, significant reductions in capacity or new entrant applications.  The current National Allocation Table is available on the EPA website at: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>In relation to the number of Emission Allowances issued since 2008, allowances were auctioned under Phase One to cover administration costs, including a final auction in March 2008 of the left over allowances from installation closures and unused new entrant reserve allowances.  Allowances from the pilot phase could not be used in subsequent phases of the ETS. <\/p><p>For Phase Two, the Government decision of 10 April 2006 stated that up to a maximum of 0.5% of the total allowances might be sold to defray the costs of administering the emissions trading scheme.  The total amount of allowances sold in Phase Two was 575,000.  These sales were administered by the National Treasury Management Agency. <\/p><p>Under Phase Three, allowances are auctioned on a Common Auction Platform co-ordinated by the Commission and run by EEX in Germany.  Ireland has a share of allowances to be auctioned and revenue beyond that required for the administration of the scheme is returned to the National Exchequer.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the Aviation sector entered the ETS in 2010 in terms of reporting, but obligations in relation to surrendering allowances commenced in 2012.<\/p><p>In terms of the monetary value of Allowances, it is difficult to place a precise value on the numbers of units held in Ireland at any particular moment in time as the owners of these units can trade them on international markets, and as such the total volume of units fluctuates, as does the price per unit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100065#WRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage to Rent Scheme Data","counter":986,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100065#WRR02250"},{"type":"question","counter":987,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[13148\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100065#WRR02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to provide details for each local authority and approved housing body, of the number of completed mortgage-to-rent transactions to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":988,"content":"<p>There are currently two Mortgage to Rent (MTR) schemes funded by my Department.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented, in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area.  Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.<\/p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.<\/p>  <p>  However, under pay-by- weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In this regard, a pay-by- weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May 2016, will be rolled out at national, regional and local levels in the coming weeks and will give invaluable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under pay-by- weight charging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100066#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100066#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[13523\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100066#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to re-establish the Dublin City Council extension grant which was discontinued in 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1027,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding to local authorities in respect of social housing adaptations and extensions, to address serious overcrowding and to meet the needs of tenants with a disability.

My Department, in conjunction with the Contracting Authorities of the three Regional Communications Centres, worked to develop a national model for a Risk-Based Approach to fire cover in all fire authorities.

Under JobBridge participants retain their jobseeker payment and in addition receive a top up towards the cost of work of &euro;52.50 per week.<\/p>  <p>  JobBridge has been very successful in meeting its objectives over the past five years.  It has helped about 19,000 mainly small employers to provide valuable work experience to nearly 48,000 unemployed jobseekers.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge published in 2013 found that overall satisfaction levels with the scheme were very high.  Two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member, and levels of abuse of the scheme by employers were very low.  Most notably the evaluation found that about 61% of participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of about completing their internship.  This is a very high progression rate and suggests that JobBridge has been instrumental in helping about 30,000 jobseekers to secure employment.<\/p>  <p>  JobBridge is giving opportunities to jobseekers across the spectrum of qualifications.  Participation on the scheme is voluntary.<\/p>  <p>  Given the numbers of unemployed jobseekers holding graduate and post-graduate qualifications, it is obviously necessary that JobBridge is in a position to offer them an internship that reflects their abilities, aspirations and qualifications.  In this regard a previous criticism directed at the Department was that the terms of its jobseeker payments prevented jobseekers, including graduate jobseekers, from taking up internship opportunities as a route into employment, JobBridge addresses this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has a number of controls in place to prevent abuse of the scheme.  These include requirements on host organisations to provide a mentor to the intern, to sign and operate a standard agreement, to submit regular monitoring reports to the Department and to co-operate with random monitoring visits.  There are also limits placed on the number of internships that can be offered by any one organisation related to the number of staff employed by the company and there are restrictions on the repeat or sequential use of internships.  I am satisfied based on the Department&rsquo;s own monitoring visits and the report of the independent evaluation that these controls are working effectively.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these achievements JobBridge has been subject to a high level of criticism much of which is based on anecdote or very small scale surveys by various interest groups.  I intend to respond to these criticisms in the design of a new scheme.  It is however important that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible.<\/p>  <p>  It is for this reason that I intend to await the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge currently underway.  The results of this evaluation, which is again being undertaken by Indecon, are expected in September and I will announce my proposals for a new scheme shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100066#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1046,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100066#WRS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1047,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[13597\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100066#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will examine the supports for working artists in the social protection system; and if the Government will relax activation rules for working artists to allow them to support themselves as they produce the art and cultural pieces for which our country is rightly proud.

My Department is currently examining the rent limits in the context of the Government commitment and it is intended that revised rent limits, taking account of geographic variations in market rents, will be introduced as early as possible subject to agreement by Government.<\/p><p>At this time of constrained supply, the Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents exceed limits.  This ensures that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  Currently, over 8,300 households are supported through this approach.<\/p><p>The Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute.  Following engagement with the relevant agencies this protocol was recently extended to the commuter counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow on 25 April, 2016, with plans to extend the service to Galway City over the coming week.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has identified expanding this Protocol nationwide, and the Department will continue to work with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, local authorities and Threshold to support this extension.<\/p><p>A breakdown of rent supplement recipient numbers since 2010 is provided in the attached tabular statement.

","asker":"1220","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1257,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for increases in the State pension age over a period of years.  This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) previously available at 65, thereby currently standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU\/ECB\/IMF.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  Therefore, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of this demographic change.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, resulting in an additional cost of some &euro;1 billion every 5 years, before other matters, such as rate increases, are factored in.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  While its abolition would not realise that saving in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseekers Benefit (although at a lower rate than that of the State pension), and some may have claimed for Qualified Adults on their spouse&rsquo;s pension, it is estimated that well over half of that cost may have been saved each year as a result of this measure.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  I would encourage employers, where possible, to recognise the contribution that older workers make to their businesses, and not to automatically end their employment on their 65th  birthday, particularly given the fact that the State pension age is now 66.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available up to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  People who have worked in the private sector until their 65th  birthday will generally qualify for Jobseekers benefit (which is not means-tested) rather than Jobseekers allowance, if they are unemployed and seeking work.  <\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year).<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce legislation to change from the current position, as doing so would result in a significant cost to the Exchequer and further undermine the sustainability of the pension system, which already faces significant demographic challenges.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100069#WRV03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Payments","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100069#WRV03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[13209\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100069#WRV03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the entitlements of a person in receipt of carer's allowance when they reach pension age and are also entitled to a contributory pension; and his plans to review the current arrangements.

It was on this basis that each of the DACT projects was awarded funding with a specified end-date of 30 April 2015.

One of the first schemes selected for evaluation was JobBridge.<\/p><p>The aim of the evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of its key objective of improving employment outcomes for unemployed jobseekers.  The evaluation involves a number of elements including:<\/p><p>1. Surveys of host organisation and participants to capture their perspective on, and experience of, JobBridge.<\/p><p>2. An assessment of whether or not JobBridge may be displacing paid employment in the economy.<\/p><p>3. A comparison of employment outcomes of JobBridge participants to matched non-participants.<\/p><p>The JobBridge scheme has been an effective labour market intervention to date.  It is estimated that some 15,000 interns went directly into paid employment immediately following a JobBridge internship.  Independent research indicates that this rose to 29,000 interns, or 61% of all participants after five months, compared to an average of 34% for comparable programmes in other European countries.<\/p><p>I know people who took part in JobBridge and have benefitted from it.  But it was very much a scheme for its time, and I&rsquo;m planning to replace it with a more appropriate scheme.  JobBridge was launched at a time of massive economic uncertainty and widespread unemployment.  Companies were simply not hiring because they couldn&rsquo;t afford to recruit, and in many cases insisted on a minimum level of experience.  But large numbers of recent graduates and people who lost their jobs in the recession couldn&rsquo;t get the relevant workplace experience they needed to get a first or a new job.<\/p><p>That crisis is now over, the economy is growing and employers are hiring again.  The labour market has changed and new graduates are once again finding work.<\/p><p>Job creation was at the heart of the last Government with more than 125,000 jobs created, and we have a new target to create a further 200,000.  Unemployment has fallen below 8% for the first time since the crash.  Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, I am concerned at reports that some employers might be using JobBridge as an alternative to hiring new employees.  On the other hand, I am very conscious that there are still many people who lost their jobs in the depth of the recession who are struggling to break back into the labour market and schemes like JobBridge can provide a valuable pathway to such citizens, in particular in instances where it is associated with a training programme.<\/p><p>In order that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible and reflect the experience of stakeholders, I am awaiting the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge.  This evaluation is currently well advanced; an interim progress report is expected towards the end of June and the final report in September.  This report will provide an evidential basis upon which to consider what changes should be made to improve outcomes for Jobseekers and value for money for the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100070#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Implementation","counter":1283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100070#WRW01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1284,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[13371\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100070#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he is aware of participants of the JobPath scheme managed by Turas Nua who are seeking to move onto more appropriate community employment schemes, T&uacute;s programmes or part-time employment but are being denied the right to do so; the action he will take to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1285,"content":"<p>JobPath is an employment activation service that supports people who are long-term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market to secure and sustain full-time paid employment.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding; by Q1 2016 the level of employment is up by 159,000 from the lowest level reached in 2012.  Youth unemployment is estimated at 15.0% (27,900 persons) in May 2016 and has fallen from a peak of over 30% at the trough of the recession.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.

The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed was implemented.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.<\/p><p>Places on most of these programmes are demand led.  While it was anticipated that take-up on the relevant programmes in 2014 might be as high as 28,000, actual take-up was 23,000.  As the economy has improved, inflows into these programmes have decreased further, reflecting the drop in youth unemployment.  There were just over 19,000 places taken up in 2015.  The number of starters during the first three months of 2016 is detailed in the table.  On the basis of the trend in the early part of the year, it is estimated that the full-year intake in 2016 will be somewhat below the 2015 figure of 19,000.<\/p><p><b>Quarter 1 2016 Starters (information available up to 27th May 2016)<\/b><table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th>Number of starters up to Q1 2016<\/th><th>Note<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Youthreach<\/td><td>n\/a <\/td><td>Youthreach (q1 figures will be available in June)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Training Centres<\/td><td>532<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge\u00a0 <\/td><td>370<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s<\/td><td>258 <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobsPlus ( including JobsPlus Youth)<\/td><td>35<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Momentum<\/td><td>118<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>Intake is mainly in September<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTWEA<\/td><td>46<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VTOS<\/td><td>n\/a <\/td><td>Enrolment begins in September<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Former F&Aacute;S\/SOLAS<\/td><td>1319<\/td><td>Based on Specific Skills Training, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; Local Training Initiative starters. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training<\/td><td>0 <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gateway<\/td><td>3<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment<\/td><td>301<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>3,044<\/td><td>Excluding where figures are not available<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100070#WRW03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1319,"content":"<p>Question No. 500 answered with Question No. 487.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1321,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[13410\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100070#WRW03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to clarify his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 90 of 6 April 2016, which provided data on the number of young persons under 25 years of age who had completed personal progression plans under the Youth Guarantee programme, in view of the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 72 of 7 July 2015, which indicated different and much lower numbers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1322,"content":"<p>I want to assure the Deputy that the most recent figures supplied to him in the Parliamentary Question Number 90 of 6 April 2016 are correct.

This means that young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments are referred to a caseworker, and are engaged with more systematically in terms of their rights and responsibilities, at an earlier date than older unemployed people.

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness, disability and caring schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise when the application form is not competed fully or supporting documentation is not provided at claim stage; if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  For example, pension claims on hand for more than three months typically occur in the case of EU\/bilateral pensions where information from other jurisdictions is awaited or, in the case of self-employed, there may be outstanding PRSI liabilities.  These delays impact on the award of household benefits in many cases as these secondary payments are linked to the award of the primary benefit. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Intreo service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into my Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in the form of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary welfare payments. <\/p><p>There is no backlog in family income supplement (FIS), new claims are processed promptly within 2\/3 weeks and renewals are processed in advance of the previous claim period ending. <\/p><p>Treatment benefit is also processed without delay, usually within 1 to 1.5 weeks of receipt. <\/p><p>90% of Illness Benefit claims are processed within 7 days. <\/p><p>Both carer&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance, which are means-tested schemes, are experiencing some delays presently.  Delays are also occurring in domiciliary care allowance.  This primarily is due to an ongoing increase in new claim intake over the past few years to all three of these schemes and the complexity attached to processing of these applications.  In addition, there is reluctance, sometimes, on the part of applicants to give full information at application stage thereby slowing down the processing of their application and in some cases necessitating a visit by a Departmental investigative officer. <\/p><p>Reducing these waiting times is a priority for my Department.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.

It represents one of the most pervasive forms of gender based violence.  Its prevalence in certain regions is in general not the result of Government policy but of traditional practice, based on a complex range of factors.<\/p><p>Experience has shown that, through constructive engagement with Governments and communities, consistent progress on harmful practices such as FGM can be achieved.  While the rate of progress has been uneven, there has been a considerable decline in the prevalence of FGM over the past three decades.  The achievement of agreement at the United Nations in 2015 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes a target shared by all UN members to eliminate the practice of FGM by 2030.  Ireland played a central role in co-facilitating the process which led to this agreement and, nationally, advocated strongly for the inclusion of the target on FGM.<\/p><p>Our trade relations with countries in which FGM is prevalent do not have a particular relevance to the work to eliminate the practice.  They do not in any way prevent us from raising human rights issues.  Ireland has made strong statements against FGM internationally, in particular during our term in the Human Rights Council.  For example, we made specific recommendations in relation to FGM in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Guinea.  These recommendations were accepted by the Government of Guinea. <\/p><p>In addition through our programme of development assistance, we focus on tackling many of the root causes of FGM, including persistent poverty, gender inequality, and gender based violence.  Our aid programme in Sierra Leone prioritises the empowerment of women and girls, and in 2015, for instances we provided more than &euro;2 million to address some of the root causes of FGM in the country.  <\/p><p><font color=\"#37605E\"> <\/font>We also provide core funding to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the UN Fund for Children (UNICEF) which operate a Joint Programme on FGM in 17 countries, including Egypt, Sudan, Mali, Somalia, and Guinea.  In 2015, Ireland provided &euro;7.2 million in core funding to UNICEF, and &euro;2.8 million in core funding to the UNFPA.<\/p><p>We also support UN Women and the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women.  Operating at local, national and international levels, these UN agencies work to combat gender inequality, to mobilise action by young people, families, communities, and civil society groups to end the practice of female genital mutilation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100072#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":1405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100072#WRY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1406,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[13394\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100072#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will make representations to the governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on the removal of restrictions on press freedom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1407,"content":"<p>Ireland has raised freedom of expression and media freedom in a wide range of countries, both through national statements and bilateral diplomatic contacts and through the EU.<\/p>  <p>  In the most recent session of the UN Human Right Council in March 2016, the EU statement delivered a Statement in which it raised concerns about &ldquo;increased pressure &ndash; including through travel bans - on journalists, cultural organisations, academia and civil society&rdquo; in Egypt and noted that &ldquo;limitations on freedom of expression and the severe punishments against human rights defenders and bloggers are also of concern&rdquo; in respect of Saudi Arabia.<\/p>  <p>  The EU raised concerns about press freedom in the UAE during the most recent meeting of the EU-UAE Human Rights Dialogue, which took place on 26 May 2016 in Abu Dhabi.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland made a recommendation to the UAE on freedom of expression and internet freedom in the UAE&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council.

Public access to heritage attractions has a high priority and much effort has been made to improve access and information at all built heritage sites. <\/p><p>There are a total of almost 1,000 individual National Monuments in State care at approximately 768 locations around the country.

A small number of sites have National Monuments which are State owned and others which are privately held at the same location. <\/p><p>As a general policy, the OPW facilitates visitor access to as many National Monument sites as possible.  However, access is not always feasible because of a range of issues including physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, by reason of accident risk, livestock etc.  The OPW would estimate that approximately 10% of the National Monument sites in its care are not accessible at any given time.<\/p><p>As part of its remit, the OPW also provides enhanced visitor access, together with guide facilities in some cases, at approx. 70 of the more prominent visitor locations nationally.

The management of public expenditure by Government Departments has played an important role in ensuring that these key fiscal targets have been achieved.  The EU Commission has recommended that Ireland has met the requirements to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact at the end of 2015. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy suggests, Public Service Reform was a key element of the Government's response to the crisis and the strategy for recovery.  The reforms implemented over the past five years enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets, at a time of increased demand for public services.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that economic and social progress go hand in hand. Only a strong economy supporting people at work can pay for the services needed to create a fair society. The Programme for Government, therefore, sets out a clear strategy for increasing spending in a sustainable way built on stable revenues. <\/p>  <p>  A second Public Service Reform Plan (2014-2016) was published in January 2014.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes.  The actions set out in the Reform Plan address areas such as: greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement; increased accountability and transparency in public decision making; enhanced leadership and performance management; and a continued focus on building the required capacity to deliver reform.    This second Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-16 published in April 2016 sets out the significant progress that has been made over the last year in implementing the cross-cutting reform actions set out in the Plan<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles. There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.<\/p>  <p>  The end-April Exchequer returns show that most Departments continue to manage expenditure within profile. However, these returns provide some indications of areas where there may be some pressures.  As outlined in the analysis of Gross Voted Expenditure published with the Exchequer Returns, Health gross current spending was over profile by &euro;78 million (1.7%) at the end of April.  <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2016 Stability Programme Update (SPU) it was estimated at that time, on the technical no policy change basis on which the SPU was prepared, that over the course of the year, voted spending pressures amounting to c. &frac14; per cent of GDP could materialise.

In the process leading up to the publication of the current capital plan: 'Building Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021' the previous Government sought to ensure that  resources were focused where needed in order to protect economic recovery and meet social needs. <\/p><p>Identifying the capital needs of an economy is undoubtedly a complex process.  To come to a firm view on the scale and composition of infrastructural needs, over the short, medium and long term, a number of factors need to be considered and analysed, such as for example:<\/p><p>- the existing level and composition of public capital stock;<\/p><p>- the social and economic value of infrastructure; <\/p><p>- the scale of the infrastructural deficit;<\/p><p>- geographic considerations; and <\/p><p>- economic growth projections. <\/p><p>It is also very important that the investment is efficient. Assessing the efficiency of investment requires methodologies to identify projects and programmes with the most favourable cost-benefit ratios.<\/p><p>Investment plans must also be fiscally sustainable.  As we know from our experiences in the period from 2008 onwards, the  costs of a fiscal crisis are such that the funding of investment plans must be strictly consistent with the overarching parameters of budgetary policy.  <\/p><p>Following final Government deliberations, the 2016-2021 plan was published last September with a commitment to conduct a mid-term review in mid 2017. This commitment has been confirmed in 'A Programme for a Partnership Government'.  <\/p><p>This review will provide the Government with the opportunity to review capital spending plans and allocate the additional funding identified in the Programme for Government to priority areas. <\/p><p>In specific terms, the Programme for a Partnership Government has proposed, subject to Oireachtas approval, an additional &euro;4billion in exchequer capital investment up to 2021. Following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan the Government will increase capital investment in transport, broadband, education, health and flood defences.<\/p><p>In the appendix attached to this reply, details are provided of investment plans in the specific areas referenced in the Deputy's question.<\/p><p>Appendix<\/p><p>Road, rail, air and sea transport:<\/p><p>The Exchequer transport capital allocation is largely framed by the recommendations and priorities set out in the published Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport. These priorities are threefold: to maintain and renew the strategically important elements of the existing land transport system; to address urban congestion; and to improve the efficiency and safety of existing transport networks.<\/p><p>In recognition of the fact that medium and long-term planning of transport infrastructure is well developed, the &euro;9.6 billion capital envelope for transport will be provided over seven years. This will include &euro;6 billion for investment in the national, regional and local road network and &euro;3.6 billion in Public Transport. A &euro;28 million investment package for safety and security enhancements at the regional airports to ensure connectivity for balanced regional development is also included in the Capital Plan. The largest single project will be a new metro link in Dublin. Based on the outcome of the Fingal\/North Dublin Transport Study, the National Transport Authority has recommended that a revised metro project be selected as the appropriate public transport project to address the transport needs of the Swords\/Airport\/City-Centre Corridor. It is planned that Metro North will be in operation by 2026\/2027. <\/p><p>Access to high speed reliable telecommunications:<\/p><p>An initial allocation of &euro;275m of Exchequer funding has been provided to the National Broadband Programme as part of the first six years of an envisaged 20 year contract. While it is expected that the network will be built between 2016 and 2020, the overall funding will be spread over 20 years and this envelope represents a proportion of that funding. <\/p><p>Another significant development in this context is the creation of the Connectivity Fund, which has been formed from the proceeds of the sale of the Government's shareholding in Aer Lingus. The Fund, which operates on a commercial basis, is available to provide support for commercial investment projects with a connectivity theme, including data and energy connectivity.  <\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to providing additional exchequer capital, if needed, to deliver on the commitment to bring next generation broadband to every house and business in the country by 2020. <\/p><p>Renewable energy:<\/p><p>The Government is committed to reducing carbon emissions and increasing our use of renewable energy. &euro;444 million has been provided for investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes from 2016 to 2021.<\/p><p>Housing:<\/p><p>Direct Exchequer investment in the area of social housing of nearly &euro;3 billion has been provided. This will help deliver an additional 35,000 housing units by 2020. Around 18,000 of these additional housing units will come on stream between now and 2017 with the balance provided between 2018 and 2020. A further 75,000 households will have their housing needs met through leasing and renting in the private rental sector.<\/p><p>This is supported by PPP investment of &euro;300m which is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units. This investment is to be delivered in three bundles, each of approximately &euro;100m with 500 units expected to be delivered through each.  Details of Bundle 1 were announced last October and include:<\/p><p>- Ayrfield, Malahide Road (Dublin City) - 100 units<\/p><p>- Corkage Grange (South Dublin) - 100 units<\/p><p>- Scribblestown (Dublin City) - 100 units<\/p><p>- Dunleer, (Co.

This includes, for example, a very significant reduction in the Public Service pay bill and changes to terms and conditions such as reduced sick leave entitlements and additional working hours. In addition to the reduced cost of the Public Service overall, reform is also delivering savings across a range of specific areas such as shared services, procurement reform and property management.<\/p><p>A second Public Service Reform Plan (2014-2016) was published in January 2014.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes.

Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  My Department operates Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties, and give support to owners\/occupiers in their long-term commitment to securing the future of the architectural heritage which might otherwise be lost.  Applications for this scheme have now closed for 2016, and recommended projects are currently being finalised.  <\/p><p>On 21 October 2015, I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of structures that are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).

Its aim is to support a significant number of labour-intensive, small-scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craftspeople and tradespersons in the repair of the historic built environment.

The making of an addition to, or a deletion from, the Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authority.  As the structure referred to by the Deputy is currently not on the local authority&rsquo;s Record of Protected Structures, and therefore not protected under the Planning and Development Acts, I would suggest that the local authority is contacted with a view to enquiring about this process.<\/p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.

To date, no public health service in Europe has approved it for reimbursement. <\/p>  <p>  Each country has its own reimbursement approval process.  The Irish process is laid down in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this Act, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products through the community drug schemes.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence-based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available.  The process for reimbursement approval of new high tech drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a rapid review, which has been completed by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) for Orkambi.  The second involves a full health technology assessment by the NCPE.  This process iscurrently being undertaken in respect of Orkambi.  This expert assessment evaluates whether the claims made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on issues including life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions and a reduced need for transplants.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price sought by the manufacturer. <\/p>  <p>  On completion of the assessment process, the NCPE will make a report to the HSE for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100077#WRDD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1721,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100077#WRDD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1722,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[12530\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100077#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to expedite a medical appointment for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1369","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1723,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure, and every application must be assessed on that basis. <\/p><p>Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.<\/p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government 2016 commits to maintaining a humane approach for discretionary medical card provision.  Under this approach numbers of discretionary cards has risen from 52,232 in June 2104 to 104,671 in May 2016.  The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<\/i>with a key recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  <\/p><p>The Clinical Advisory Group was established by the Director General of the HSE in January 2015 to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility.  The Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.  The Clinical Advisory Group continues to meet on  regular basis and it is expected that the Group will make a report to the Director General of the HSE when it has completed its work in the near future.<\/p><p>In mid-2014, approximately 11,000 discretionary medical cards were re-issued for a year to enable more sensitive arrangements to be put in place by the HSE.  In order to see further implementation of the administrative arrangements, these cards have been previously extended in 2015.  It is expected that the Clinical Advisory Group will report to the Director General of the HSE in the near future on improvements to take account of the burden of a disease on an individual.  In light of the expected report of the Clinical Advisory Group to the Director General of the HSE, it was decided to extend these cards by a further 6 months in order to allow time for the Minister and the HSE to consider the Clinical Advisory Group's report<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100078#WREE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":1814,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100078#WREE06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1815,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[12760\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100078#WREE06100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has been waiting longer than expected for a procedure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1816,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The 2014 estimate for the project, as set out in the approved Project Brief, affirmed delivery of  the core hospital, including both satellite centres, within this envelope.  The estimate includes provision for inflation, VAT and contingencies. It does not include equipment or ICT which can be purchased, licensed or leased separately.  Philanthropic and commercial funding streams are to be targeted as appropriate for supporting elements of the project to include car parking and research facilities.  As with any capital project, it is essential that cost estimates be reviewed and refined as appropriate, including making prudent provision for construction inflation.  Ultimately, costs for the new children's hospital project at the St James's campus, and the satellite centres at the Connolly and Tallaght campuses, will be determined during the tendering process, which is expected to be very competitive, with significant interest from contractors.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of transitioning the new children's hospital to a site at or adjacent to Connolly Hospital has not been assessed in any detail, as no such project exists.  It is of course well understood that construction costs on a greenfield site are likely to be less than on an urban site and this was addressed in the 2012 Dolphin report, and in the further analysis sought by the Minister for Health to inform the Government decision on the location of the hospital.  However, transition of the new children's hospital from the current site at St James's to any other site would require the abandonment of the current project, for which planning permission has now been secured and in relation to which tenders for enabling works contract have been received by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB).  As well as re-opening planning risk for this much-needed hospital, a new site would mean that costs incurred to date would be likely to be, in the main, written off.  More importantly, the new hospital would be significantly delayed; based on the experience at both the Mater campus and the St James's campus, it is likely that if the hospital were to move to a third site, a period of three to four years would elapse before a planning decision was received.  Only then would construction begin, subject to a favourable planning decision.  This much longer timeline would mean that construction inflation would be likely to have a significant impact on project costs.  Together with lost expenditure on the project to date, that could offset much if not all of any savings to be obtained from building on a greenfield site. <\/p>  <p>  The previous Government's decision on the location of the new children's hospital was not determined by construction cost, but by clinical considerations.  The fundamental aim of this vital project is to ensure the best possible health outcomes for children and young people in Ireland.  As announced in July 2015, it is intended that the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the St James's campus in time, achieving tri-location of paediatric, maternity and adult services on one campus.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, and delivers significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site.  St James's Hospital has the widest range of sub-specialties and highest level of clinical complexity of all hospitals in the country, as well as a strong and well-developed research infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.<\/p>  <p>  A significant upgrade of Connolly Hospital would be required to achieve the same quality of clinical outcomes as co-location\/tri-location with St James&rsquo;s.  As set out in the Dolphin report, Connolly Hospital would need very substantial investment of human and capital resources to develop over time into an adult tertiary hospital with critical mass supported by leading edge research facilities, additional to the capital cost of developing the children's hospital itself on the campus. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100079#WRFF06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital Status","counter":1884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100080#WRGG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1885,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[13158\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100080#WRGG00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"with regard to the proposed national children&rsquo;s hospital, the proposed timeline for completion of the hospital at St. James, and the proposed timeline for completion at the Connolly site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1230","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1886,"content":"<p>There is no formal timeline for completion of the new children's hospital at a site on or adjacent to the Connolly Hospital campus, as no such project is planned.

The planned new facilities will provide us with the means to deliver on improved health outcomes for children, especially the sickest children in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the statutory body charged with delivery of the capital project.  The Project Brief developed by the Board in 2014 was approved by the HSE, with the prior consent of the Minister, in accordance with the statutory approval process.  Design development was undertaken by the Board in accordance with the approved Project Brief, culminating in the submission of a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la last August.  I am delighted at the unanimous decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant planning permission for these vital new facilities as designed, clearing the way for enabling works to begin this summer.

These medicines include benzodiazepines and certain z-drugs.  The Misuse of Drugs Acts and Regulations impose restrictions on the production, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs.  A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug for the purpose of selling or supplying it in contravention of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, is guilty of an offence under that legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Following a Court of Appeal decision on 10 March 2015 which declared unconstitutional the section of the Misuse of Drugs Act empowering the Government to declare substances to be controlled under the Act, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was urgently enacted to recontrol all substances which had previously been declared controlled by Government order.  A further Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to declare substances to be controlled, including prescription medicines, is currently being drafted and is intended to be published as soon as possible.

A Steering Committee, chaired by former General Secretary of the INTO John Carr and with representatives from the Statutory, Community and Voluntary Sectors, has been established to advise on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy, which will cover the period from 2017 onwards.

Under this legislation and regulations made thereunder, over 200 substances (legal highs) were controlled by means of statutory instruments in May 2010 and a further 60 in November 2011.  Substances were controlled either by means of individual names or by means of generic definition.  <\/p>  <p>  Experience has shown that new psychoactive substances can quickly emerge and there will always be a time lag before such new substances can be made subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  Accordingly, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 was introduced as a general criminal justice measure to deal with new psychoactive substances as they emerge, making it a criminal offence to sell, import or export, for human consumption, a psychoactive substance which was not regulated or controlled under other legislation.  The Act works in tandem with the ongoing controlling of specified substances under the Misuse of Drugs Acts and continues in place as supporting legislation to the Misuse of Drugs Legislation.  On foot of these two pieces of legislation nearly all of the over 100 head shops then existing were closed in 2010.  The legislative actions above were taken in tandem with education and awareness-raising initiatives informing of the potential dangers of the use of psychoactive substances.  <\/p>  <p>  While there has been no formal evaluation of the approach taken, a study by researchers in Trinity College Dublin published in June 2015 has shown a significant reduction in both recent and problematic use among young people of novel psychoactive substances in the year after the Government introduced legislative changes targeting the sale and supply of such substances.  The researchers acknowledge that the study cannot prove a causal relationship between the closure of the head shops and reductions in NPS use by these adolescents, however their findings have shown that the implementation of legislation, targeted primarily at the vendors of NPS, coincided with a fall in NPS use among this high risk group of teenagers who attend a drug and alcohol treatment service. <\/p>  <p>  The results of the most recent General Population drugs prevalence survey for 2014\/15, which will be released by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol later this year, will provide up-to-date data on the prevalence of NPS use in the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100083#WRKK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Data","counter":2074,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100083#WRKK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2075,"qnumday":766,"qnumall":"[13561\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100083#WRKK01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average waiting time for patients under 18 years of age and patients over 18 years of age in the Health Service Executive south region who require specialist orthodontic treatment; the current number of such cases on the waiting list in the region; the number of these patients who have been waiting for two years or longer; and if there are plans to deal with the length of time patients have to wait.","asker":"1352","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2076,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

Since 2015 a number of simplification measures have been announced by the Commission, with the following range of measures introduced in 2016. These measures are either under way or will be announced shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Following pressure from Ireland and some other Member States, the Commission has introduced a simplified system of administrative penalties and a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; system for first time breaches of certain direct payments rules. This system reduces the administrative penalty by 50% for a first-time breach for minor over-declarations i.e. less than 10% of the overall area. However, the farmer will be subjected to an on-the-spot inspection in the following year. While the implementation of the penalty element of this system can be introduced quite easily, the current requirement to re-inspect all yellow card recipients in the following year is more complex. This requirement will not result in reduced administration costs and I am pressing the Commission to ensure that a more targeted approach is taken on this particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission has also introduced a facility allowing Member States to conduct preliminary checks of aid applications which will allow farmers to make corrections to their applications for up to 35 days after the final date of submission, without penalty. This is most welcome and my Department is implementing this system for online applications, which comprise over 75% of all Basic Payment Scheme applications in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  On Rural Development, the publicity requirements for smaller farmers and the programming rules for financial instruments have been simplified and were recently adopted.<\/p>  <p>  Commissioner Hogan will announce a greening package at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in June, which is intended to be in place for the 2017 claim year.

As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to work constructively as a vehicle for addressing issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector. The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cashflow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level. Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016. Factors contributing to this global price volatility include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side. The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will continue to be a challenging year.<\/p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector. The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play. These measures are not enough on their own, however. The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers. I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the EU Presidency conclusions on a package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors agreed in Brussels at Council in March. This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The package includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. This extra allocation has been utilised in the interim and as recently as last week Commissioner Hogan has indicated the Commission&rsquo;s willingness to further increase this threshold to 350,000 tonnes. SMP intervention is the key EU support tool for dairy markets and helps to put a floor under prices in this extended period of downward price volatility. This extension will be particularly welcomed by Irish producers in the context of Irish dairy production patterns in the dairy sector which peak during the current period.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers. I understand that the Commission is examining this request at present. At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs. The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition my Department recently paid &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem.

This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. There is nothing to prevent employees reaching individual or collective agreements with employers on higher rates based on qualifications or other agreed criteria.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment and equality legislation, including the National Minimum Wage Acts and the Organisation of Working Time Act, protects all persons legally employed in Ireland on an employer-employee basis and provides robust safeguards for employees. <\/p><p>The Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that a trade union, or any organisation or group of persons claiming to be representative of workers or employers in any sector can ask the Labour Court to establish a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for their sector. <\/p><p>A JLC is composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a sector and they meet regularly, under an independent chairman, to discuss and agree terms and conditions, including pay, to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector.  When it reaches agreement on terms and conditions, the JLC publishes details and invites submissions.  If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration. The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals. If the Court decides they should be adopted it will forward a copy of the proposals to the Minister. If it is considered appropriate to do so, an Order giving effect to such proposals will be made by the Minister. Such an Order is known as an Employment Regulation Order. The Hotels Joint Labour Committee Establishment  Order was last amended in January 2014 on foot of a Labour Court review of JLC's.<\/p><p>There are Joint Labour Committees in place for the Catering Sectors based in Dublin and outside of Dublin and Hotels based outside of Cork and Dublin. However, due to non-engagement of employer bodies within those Sectors, no EROs have been made which would set down terms and conditions for employees in other areas of the country. Therefore the only legally enforceable minimum rates of pay in those areas are those provided for in the National Minimum Wage Acts. <\/p><p>If employees are not receiving their entitlements they can choose to have a complaint investigated by an Inspector from the Workplace Relations Commission or adjudicated upon in a hearing.  If an employee believes that his\/her rights may have been infringed and would like to obtain redress he\/she should contact the Workplace Relations Commission on Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie<\/i>.

The study, published in November, 2015, found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland. It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two. If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.<\/p>  <p>  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL. Therefore, it was essential that the various stakeholders who contributed to the study and indeed other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to engage with UL, were given an opportunity to consider and respond to the report. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of a Public Consultation. A large number of submissions were received by 4 January 2016, the closing date for receipt of such submissions. The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL, which require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department. This will inform the policy response to be considered by Government arising from the study.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100091#WRSS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2483,"content":"<p>Question No. 900 answered with Question No. 888.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Low Pay Commission Report","counter":2484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100091#WRSS02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2485,"qnumday":901,"qnumall":"[13421\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100091#WRSS03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when she expects to receive the report of the Low Pay Commission with regard to the review of the sub-minimum rates of the minimum wage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":2486,"content":"<p>The Low Pay Commission which is independent in the performance of its functions was established on a statutory basis in July 2015.

ECCE can be delivered through formal childcare settings, but also in some instances, by registered childminders. In Budget 2016, my Department announced a significant expansion to pre-school provision under the ECCE programme.  This expansion will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme  rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.<\/p><p>  My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees (CCC) around the country. The CCC staff support parents to access appropriate childcare and they also support providers to deliver and develop their service.  Pobal also assists my Department and the CCCs to identify any issues with supply and demand.<\/p><p>  In response to the expansion of ECCE announced in Budget 2016, and to support the development of capacity in the sector, my Department has initiated a number of actions. The  Department made detailed information available to the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) at the beginning of this year indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017. My Department continues to work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees to match this data against reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand.  My Department is working with them on the development of action plans for areas where a shortfall in supply has been identified. Although Tusla, local authorities and other statutory bodies have no specific remit in relation to the supply of ECCE places, my Department will liaise with any bodies who have a role in facilitating the provision of childcare capacity as required.<\/p><p>  My Department also announced the introduction of an Early Years Capital Programme earlier this year with total funding of &euro;4 million available.

The Committee has an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services. In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013. The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people.<\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published on 8th October, 2015. The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy. There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectorial, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures. At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council. At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees. Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework.<\/p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. These include, the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards, Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services. The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant. I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives.<\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  I intend that the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee will be considered in the light of these developments and in relation the implementation arrangements in place to achieve our national strategies' objectives to secure the best possible outcomes for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100094#WRVV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Work Projects Funding","counter":2585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100094#WRVV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2586,"qnumday":935,"qnumall":"[13398\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016053100094#WRVV01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her priorities for investment in youth work services given the commitment in the programme for Government to fund an expansion in youth services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2587,"content":"<p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services by the voluntary youth sector, to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.
