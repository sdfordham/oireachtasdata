In that context, Foras na Gaeilge, an agency of the North\/South Language Body, An Foras Teanga, has a key statutory role in provision of resources and supports for the Irish language on an all-island basis.<\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to the feasibility of introducing a voluntary code for bilingual labelling and packaging of goods, I am pleased to say that Foras na Gaeilge is currently compiling an e-book on best practice in bilingual packaging.  The recommendations in this e-book - <i>'Pac&aacute;ist&iacute;ocht Bia agus D&aacute;theangachas: Taighde ar Fh&eacute;idearachta&iacute;' - <\/i> are based on research commissioned by Foras na Gaeilge and carried out by the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The e-book is aimed primarily at private sector companies and will demonstrate how bilingual packaging can be used to a competitive advantage.  It is envisaged that the e-book will be available by the end of the year.<\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to initiatives to encourage young writers in Irish, Foras na Gaeilge funds a range of schemes and provides advice and assistance to young writers\/script writers through the funding of workshops, the Irish Writers Centre, drama companies and arts centres. For example, the Blogging Scheme or <i>Sc&eacute;im Blag&aacute;la<\/i>, provides transition-year students with the opportunity to read an Irish language book and blog about it, giving rise to lively debates between young people in different geographical regions.  This scheme is organised in various Gaeltacht regions under the auspices of Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne.  Another example is the <i>Scr&iacute;obh Leabhar <\/i>  project, which provides an opportunity for children to write their own books through Irish and some of these have been published online.  This project is run in conjunction with the &Aacute;isaonad in Northern Ireland and with Education Centres in this jurisdiction.<\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to the provision of an Irish language venue, including a bookshop, I should point out that Conradh na Gaeilge, which is funded by Foras na Gaeilge, runs the 'Siopa Leabhar' on Harcourt Street.  The venue also provides Irish language resources for teachers, learners and the general public in the same building.<\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to the development of an online stock and order management system for Irish books and other media, 1980 Bord na Gaeilge established <i>An &Aacute;is&iacute;neacht D&aacute;ili&uacute;ch&aacute;n Leabhar<\/i>  , better known as &Aacute;IS, to distribute Irish-language books on a wholesale basis, both nationally and internationally.  Following completion of a recent review on the operations of &Aacute;IS, major initiatives are underway to improve the service. These include development of a new web-based information service, in conjunction with Cl&aacute;r na Leabhar Gaeilge, which will be available on the URL 'www.leabhar.ie'.  That service will include a trade-end online ordering facility and a facility for publishers to view sales figures. I understand that preparatory work began on this initiative in late 2012 and that the target date for project completion is October 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[19270\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the expected time frame for his decision on the application for planning on 14-17 Moore Street, Dublin 1; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[19242\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will commission an independent battlefield site assessment to include the 1916 evacuation route and the area encompassing Moore Street, Moore Lane, Henry Street, the GPO, Upper O'Connell Street and Parnell Street\/Rotunda Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[19373\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans regarding Moore Street and the National Monument in view of the recent Dublin City Council Report on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[19241\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his views on the Report of the Dublin City Council Moore Street Advisory Committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 23, 27 and 45 together. <\/p><p>  I refer to the reply to Priority Question No. 3 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":25,"content":"<p>Question No. 17 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[19287\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"in view of the recent criticisms of the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, the progress that has been made as regards the commitment in the 20 years strategy on the Irish language to strengthen the position of Irish as an internal working language in Gaeltacht areas and among other Irish speaking units in services to the community; and the discussions he has had with the Department of Justice and Equality on same.","asker":"1083","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The Deputy will understand, therefore, that it would not be appropriate for me to express any view in relation to this area of the Coimisin&eacute;ir's work.

However, I should point out that the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030<\/i>   recognises the need for the development and strengthening of language awareness and language training programmes so that a higher proportion of public service staff, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will have the ability to provide services in Irish to customers, including those located in Gaeltacht areas.

As a first step, my Department  recently signed a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the provision of Irish language training and proficiency testing for the civil service and certain public service organisations.. The purpose of this agreement is to support staff in developing their proficiency in the Irish language and to enhance the capacity of the civil service and other bodies to provide services in Irish to the public.<\/p><p><br \/>  I should also point out that in the context of the overall implementation of the Strategy, officials of my Department have conducted bilateral meetings with their colleagues in relevant government departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality, in order to promote the language awareness agenda. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[19365\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will publish the report of the Working Group setup to explore fundraising opportunities following on from the commitment given in the Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[19272\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the progress that has been made in the implementation of the Forum on Philanthropy report's recommendations within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[19363\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his views on whether considering the size of the Irish market and the downturn in the economy the focus solely on philanthropy as a source of funding for the Arts is realistic and his further views on whether a broad acknowledgement of multiple sources of public and private investment is vital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[19364\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"in view of the commitment given in the Programme for Government to work with stakeholders in the Arts community to develop proposals aimed at building support of the Arts if he will provide a detailed account of the progress made to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1037","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[19705\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which his Department or its subsidiary bodies have attracted private funding for the arts directly or by way of sponsorship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[19543\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500046#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will outline his proposals to facilitate greater philanthropic funding of the arts and heritage here; if he has discussed any proposals with the Department of Finance to allow for taxation incentives for donations which may help bridge funding gaps in such areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 36, 44, 49, 132 and 138 together.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to \"work with stakeholders in the Arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support of the Arts in Ireland exploring philanthropic, sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities\".  To further this objective, in May 2012 I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations.  The initiative - the Philanthropic Leverage Initiative - was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative, established with funding of &euro;230,000 for 2012, has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts. The initiative was available across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms to not-for-profit organisations for arts programming projects.<\/p><p>  The organisations approved for funding under the initiative were required to procure matching philanthropic funds and complete their drawdown from my Department in 2012.  Matched funding could come from public funds or from any public sector organisation.  At the outset, it was anticipated that a multiple of 2.5 on the pilot initiative funds of &euro;230,000 would result in philanthropic funding of some &euro;800,000 being raised for the arts.  The scheme proved very successful with private sector philanthropic donations &euro;4.26 being leveraged for every &euro;1 of public funds.  I recently launched a similar initiative for 2013.  Full details including application forms are available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  The Philanthropic Leverage Initiative was run in parallel with a second initiative - the Arts Council's RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity pilot initiative.  That initiative will provide one-to-one professional support to eight selected organisations for two years through planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme.  This will help those art organisations build and resource their capacity to attract philanthropic giving.  In developing this complementary programme, the Arts Council has identified that it is vital for art groups to develop, agree and implement an effective fundraising strategy and to properly resource that fundraising function.<\/p><p>  My Department has also provided support to the Business to Arts organisation for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland.  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &euro;400k over three years.  In 2010, my Department also awarded a &euro;20,000 grant to Business to Arts for &lsquo;Fund it&rsquo; in 2010 under the Cultural Technology Grants Scheme. Business to Arts initially matched this figure with private funding and since then has attracted additional foundation funds to this project.  <\/p><p>  There is not now nor has there been any intention that philanthropy could become the sole source of funding for the arts. The allocation to the National Gallery in 2013 is &euro;7.677m. The allocation by my Department to the other National Cultural Institutions is &euro;30.629m. <\/p><p>  The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  As Minister with responsibility for the arts, I believe that, within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity and potential of the sector.  The arts are a significant contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery.<\/p><p>  Government policy on the arts is set out in the Programme for Government. As Minister responsible for the arts and culture sectors, I am committed to securing the best possible funding provision for them during my term in office.  Government policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism. Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions. In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of &euro;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding. The allocation to the Irish Film Board is &euro;14.858m.<\/p><p>  The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and our economy.  I am fully aware of the challenges for those involved in the arts and culture sectors and of the tremendous work they are doing I am committed to supporting the essential elements of the arts.

The Arts Council's strategic approach has a dual focus on supporting artists and arts organisations and on seeking to increase public engagement and participation in the arts.

Value for money is determined according to a range of indicators. Some of these, such as audience numbers or the financial health of an organisation, lend themselves to relatively easy measurement. Others, such as quality of artistic direction or the significance of an organisation for provision in a particular art form, are no less important for being less amenable to measurement.

It is also an important element of the country's cultural tourism product as a means of encouraging the Irish diaspora to visit the land of their ancestors.  The Government, at my instigation and cognisant of its commitments under the Programme for Government, recently agreed a national genealogy policy.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In Ireland, the situation regarding genealogical research is complicated for historical reasons. Few records have survived compared to other countries.  <font color=\"#212100\">The fire in the Public Record Office complex in the Four Courts during the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) resulted in the severe damage and destruction of many records and impaired the range of records available for genealogical purposes.  It is very important that the genealogy records which exist are presented in a way that is easy to use and understand and readily accessible. <\/font>The national genealogy policy aims to bring some coherence to this area.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As part of the policy, I have recently launched the updated website  incorporating a web portal.  The new web portal will enable visitors to the site to search genealogy records from a number of online sources particularly in the State sector.  A link will then bring the user directly to the results of the search.  Now for the first time, one search on  will inform the user whether relevant records are available in a number of online sources such as the Church Records currently available on , Tithe Applotments, Griffiths Valuations and the 1901 and 1911 Census records.  The improved search capabilities of this website are part of my Department's contribution to the Government's Gathering Initiative.  It is hoped that this site will contribute to genealogical tourism by making easier for the Diaspora to connect with their heritage.  It is also hoped that the enhanced website will help to simplify the way that the State presents genealogy records.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy may be aware, there are a wide variety of organisations that already provide valuable services to those seeking information on their ancestry.  My Department would be happy to discuss the provision of a searched link from the webportal on  to allow users to search the websites of those organisations.

She welcomed the agreement reached between the two parties on a number of outstanding issues which &ndash; it is hoped &ndash; will facilitate the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina and which goes a long way towards fulfilling the conditions for progress on their respective European paths.  The High Representative also updated Ministers on the latest round of the E3+3 talks on Iran, held in Almaty on 5-6 April, and gave a brief overview of recent developments in DPRK.  In addition, she referred briefly to the situation in Mali, noting the progress made with regard to the EU training mission (EUTM Mali) which has been up and running since 2 April and in which eight members of the Defence Forces are participating.  The Council adopted comprehensive conclusions on Mali which, inter alia, welcomed the Malian Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the \"roadmap\" for the transition and organising free, credible and transparent elections in July. <\/p><p>  Under the Southern Neighbourhood heading, the Council had a comprehensive exchange of views on the situation in Syria.  I and other colleagues reiterated the urgent need to arrive at a political settlement to the two-year old crisis and expressed our full support for Special Envoy Brahimi in his efforts to promote this.  The Council agreed to ease certain EU sanctions against Syria including the oil embargo, with a view both to helping the civilian population and supporting the opposition.  Ministers also briefly discussed the difficulties faced by neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Jordan in the context of the ongoing crisis in Syria and its humanitarian consequences.  In my own intervention I highlighted the predicament of the rapidly growing Syrian refugee population and mentioned in this regard my visit to a Syrian refugee camp during my recent visit to Turkey.  High Representative Ashton also gave a short debriefing on a visit she paid recently to Egypt, where growing political and social tensions are a source of serious concern.  <\/p><p>  Under the Eastern Partnership heading, the Council took stock of preparations for an Eastern Partnership Ministerial meeting which is scheduled for Brussels in July and which will prepare the ground for the Eastern Partnership Summit in November in Vilnius.  <\/p><p>  Finally, the Council discussed Myanmar\/Burma.  Ministers welcomed the advances being made so far towards democracy and congratulated the Government on this progress.  In recognition of reforms already implemented, the Council agreed to lift all sanctions against Myanmar\/Burma with the exception of the arms embargo, which has been extended for one year.  This decision is just one step in our developing relationship with Burma\/Myanmar as it pursues democracy and reform.

Ireland and its EU partners stand ready to assist Myanmar\/Burma as it continues with the efforts it is making towards political, economic and social transition. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[19664\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if any new initiatives were discussed at the most recent European Union Foreign Affairs Council meeting in relation to Syria, particularly in relation to humanitarian issues in that region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>Syria was the major issue discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April, which I attended.  The focus was on the rapidly deteriorating situation in the country and on what further steps the EU can take to support the ongoing efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict and mitigate its impact on the civilian population.  These objectives remain central to the mission of the UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi who made clear, when he briefed the UN Security Council on 19 April, that the choice faced by Syria is either a destructive fight to the finish or a negotiated political resolution.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on 22 April reiterated its full support for Mr. Brahimi's efforts as well as for the initiative taken by the former President of the National Syrian Coalition, Dr Al Khatib, to bring about political dialogue among all Syrians leading to a peaceful transition. <\/p><p>  EU sanctions are essential in maintaining strong pressure on the Syrian authorities so as to persuade them to stop their campaign of repression and brutality against the Syrian people.  Over recent weeks, including at the informal Ministerial meeting I co-hosted with High Representative Ashton in Dublin on 22\/23 March, the Council has been discussing these sanctions in detail.  Consideration has also been given to other, non-military ways in which the secular and moderate opposition can be supported and much needed relief and basic services provided to the population.  In this regard, I welcome the decision by the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 April to ease a series of economic restrictive measures, notably in the oil sector, so as to allow for possible trade in this sector with areas now controlled by the Syrian National Coalition. <\/p><p>  The humanitarian situation in Syria is reaching catastrophic levels, with the United Nations now estimating that 6.8 million people within Syria are in urgent need of assistance, 4.25 million of whom are displaced inside the country.  The widespread and indiscriminate violence has also forced an additional 1.3 million people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.  After over two years of conflict, the coping mechanisms of those affected by the crisis are severely depleted and the ability of neighbouring countries to absorb further refugees is close to breaking point.<\/p><p>  In this context, Ireland is making its voice heard.  Earlier this month, I saw first-hand the terrible suffering being endured by people who are forced to flee the violence when I visited Syrian refugee camps in Turkey.  My colleague, Minister of State Joe Costello, had previously visited refugee camps in Jordan last August.  I briefed my colleagues on the Council this week on my impressions and, in discussion around the table, we voiced shared concerns about the overall humanitarian situation, including the issue of humanitarian access.  I have insisted that aid organisations must be immediately granted safe and unimpeded access to those in need in all areas of Syria and that all parties to the conflict must also desist from attacking medical and educational facilities and personnel.<\/p><p>  In line with the UN Security Council's call on 19 April, Ireland is also urging member States to fulfill pledges made at the International Humanitarian Pledging Conference in Kuwait in January without delay, as the current shortfall in funding severely undermines the humanitarian response.  Ireland has already contributed some &euro;8.15 million in emergency assistance in response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. <\/p><p>  The conflict in Syria will remain a major priority for us at all levels of our international engagement.  We will use the influence available to us in our current EU Presidency role to support European and UN efforts and initiatives towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[19662\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline the most recent discussions he has had with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and members of the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to parades during 2013, particularly in view of the difficulties in December and January with non-notified parades; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I have discussed the upcoming marching season, including the role of the Parades Commission, in the context of non-notified parades, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers on a number of occasions.

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit.  Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  <\/p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:<\/p><p>  1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.<\/p><p>  2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.<\/p><p>  3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.<\/p><p>  4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned.<\/p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection.  The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work. <\/p><p>  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income.  It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.    <\/p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[19498\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500049#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of civil\/public servants under the remit of his Department who earn more than &euro;500,000, between &euro;400,000 - &euro;500,000, &euro;400,000 - &euro;300,000, &euro;300,000 - &euro;250,000, &euro;250,000 - &euro;200,000, &euro;200,000 - &euro;150,000, &euro;150,000 - &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 - &euro;80,000, &euro;80,000 - &euro;60,000, &euro;60,000 - &euro;40,000, &euro;40,000 &ndash; &euro;30,000 and less than &euro;30,000.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>The following table sets out the salary bands in respect of my Department.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Earnings Band<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number of employees<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>0-10K<\/td><td><div>26<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10-20K<\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20-30K<\/td><td><div>72<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30-40K<\/td><td><div>72<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40-50K<\/td><td><div>40<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>50-60K<\/td><td><div>36<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>60-70K<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>70-80K<\/td><td><div>34<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>80-90K<\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>90-100K<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>100-115K<\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>125-150K<\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>150K-200K<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>200K-250K<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 250K<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The <b>Revenue Commissioners<\/b>   have provided me with the following information in relation to the earnings of Revenue staff serving on 31\/12\/2012.

This standard provides guidance on the building condition assessment, sampling and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.

Eligibility for an exemption will be determined by reference to the presence of significant pyritic damage in the relevant property concerned.

The Department&rsquo;s staff are the official national representatives interfacing with the International Labour Office (ILO) and World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) as well as the WTO.<\/p><p>  In addition to WTO related duties, the Department&rsquo;s Geneva officials represent Ireland at the WIPO and ILO when officials from Dublin are unable to attend or where it would be more cost effective for Geneva based personnel to service meetings. In the case of ILO there are significant time commitments during meetings of the Governing Body (Spring and Autumn) and the International Labour Conference (three weeks each June).<\/p><p>  The staff complement servicing the national interest at these three organisations comprises 1 Principal Officer (PO), 1 Higher Executive Officer (HEO) and 1 Clerical Officer. Offices and other facilities are shared with the PMUN. During 2012 there was considerable work involved in preparing for the current Irish Presidency of the European Council. To assist with the additional obligations that Ireland is required to meet, in the latter half of 2012 two additional staff were seconded to Geneva until July 2013.<\/p><p>  In 2012 over 550 WTO related meetings were attended by the Department's officials. These included EU coordination and related meetings, as well as numerous WTO working sessions. These working sessions include key themes of trade liberalisation (Non Agricultural Market Access, Services and Agriculture) under the current Round of global trade talks known as the Doha Round and the broader WTO&rsquo;s work involving Trade Facilitation, Technical Barriers to Trade, Trade Policy Reviews, Disputes, and the international Technology Agreement as well as the start of talks on a new international agreement covering trade in international services. Furthermore this year also sees a significant increase in WTO activity as a range of items are advanced for consideration at the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in December.<\/p><p>  In total there are about 40 different working groups and specialist thematic sub groups that Ireland is required to service where possible. In addition, senior staff are required to participate in extensive networking and interaction outside the EU group in Geneva and to actively promote the Department's interests in both the ILO and WIPO.<\/p><p>  All EU Member States maintain Permanent Missions in Geneva with dedicated WTO teams and will continue to do so.<\/p><p>  On the matter of competence, the EU Commission does not have exclusive competence across the broad span of WTO trade activity\/negotiations. In addition, like all other EU MS, Ireland is a WTO member in its own right, unlike the EU, which is not a WTO Member. Furthermore, the issue of competence is not clearcut in either the ILO or WIPO where a mixture of arrangements are in place. I believe therefore that it is vital that our presence is maintained in Geneva to ensure that Ireland's particular interests in the International Institutions that set global rules for trade, intellectual property and labour law are both promoted and protected; and that Ireland can play its part along with other Member States in forming EU Trade Policy.<\/p><p>  In 2012 Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the operating costs of the WTO is CHF 2,205,826 or approximately &euro;1,823,000, calculated by reference to the proportion of Irish trade to global trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500052#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500052#WRH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[19500\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500052#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of civil\/public servants under the remit of his Department who earn more than &euro;500,000, between &euro;400,000 - &euro;500,000, &euro;400,000 - &euro;300,000, &euro;300,000 - &euro;250,000, &euro;250,000 - &euro;200,000, &euro;200,000 - &euro;150,000, &euro;150,000 - &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 - &euro;80,000, &euro;80,000 - &euro;60,000, &euro;60,000 - &euro;40,000, &euro;40,000 &ndash; &euro;30,000 and less than &euro;30,000.","asker":"1017","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>The following table identifies the persons employed in my Department broken down by the salary bands supplied.

The business was acquired in 2008 by a California based manufacturer of metal fixings and hangers used in construction of wooden frame housing. Employment had gradually declined to approximately 30 by 2011. By this time, the plant was consistently loss making and on a 3 day week.

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department so that people can continue living at home.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.<\/p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.<\/p><p>  The supports to carers from my Department are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well.  The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500054#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":278,"content":"<p>Question No. 109 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":279,"content":"<p>Question No. 110 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500054#WRK01650"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[19618\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500054#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if rent support is payable in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[19713\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500054#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if rent support is payable in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who has accumulated considerable rent arrears and is in danger of being evicted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 119 together.<\/p><p>  The Rent Supplement claim in this case was suspended, pending establishment of entitlement to a primary social welfare payment.

It is essential to strike a balance between our commitments to combat unemployment through the up-skilling opportunities provided by quality internship placements that offer real workplace experience, on the one hand, and the potential to destabilise the normal functioning of the labour market and a consequent reduction of opportunities for permanent employment, on the other.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection does not allow for exceptions in the nine-month limit at present.

My Department is actively engaged in a wide range of activities to this end, both in co-operation with bodies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Public Works, and in promoting its own initiatives such as our &lsquo;Places to See&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monuments to Visit&rsquo; websites, which provide directions to lesser known heritage sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival. In addition, my Department provides core funding for the Heritage Council, which supports a range of initiatives, including National Heritage Week.<\/p><p>  This year, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, my Department is also initiating a pilot programme, the Historic Towns Initiative, in Youghal, Westport and Listowel with the Heritage Council and the local authorities in each town.  This initiative is intended to promote heritage-led regeneration with the objective of harnessing cultural heritage to create desirable places to live, do business and visit.  The redevelopment of Killarney House in Killarney National Park will also be a major tourism asset in years to come.  These are but a sample of the overall range of initiatives and programmes my Department is helping to promote, support or guide as a means of preserving the quality and diversity of our heritage, which in turn, is basis for positively promoting that heritage abroad.<\/p><p>  On the broader issue of North\/South cooperation, my Department&rsquo;s remit includes the Waterways Ireland and the Language Body (encompassing Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency) which have a key role in tourism and cultural development and my Department also works on a range of issues across the area of built heritage, arts and culture and the natural heritage with public agencies in Northern Ireland where opportunities for co-operation arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500056#WRM01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural and Historical Sites","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500057#WRN00250"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[19709\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500057#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which his Department is engaged in the restoration of major historical or cultural sites throughout the country at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>The information requested is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500057#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[19710\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500057#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which he and his Department have identified buildings or sites or cultural or historical significance deemed to be at risk for whatever reason; the action in hand or planned to address such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>My Department has a comprehensive suite of tools, both legislative and advisory, at its disposal to address reports of actual damage or threats of damage to protected structures and monuments.

Member States are also allowed to confine the allocation of payment entitlements to those farmers who received a payment under the existing Single Payment Scheme in either 2010 or 2011.

Again, it is too early to say whether Ireland will exercise this particular option.

In the most recent World Health Statistics Annual Report (2012), Ireland had the 13th lowest rate of maternal mortality out of 178 countries reporting data.  It is generally recognised internationally that official vital statistics can result in an underestimate of maternal deaths.  In particular, indirect obstetric deaths resulting from previous existing disease or diseases which developed during the pregnancy may be missed in the official statistics. For this reason, Ireland established a Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) system in 2009.  In doing so, it linked itself with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Confidential MDE which has been acknowledged as a gold standard for maternal death enquiry in recent decades.  <\/p><p>  The MDE report shows that 75.4 per cent of maternities in Ireland in 2010 were women of Irish nationality and that 40% of all maternal deaths identified in the triennium 2009-2011 occurred in women who were not born in Ireland. There were 25 maternal deaths in the period, and 10 of these deaths were women not born in Ireland.  The report draws attention to how these women engage with Irish maternity services and the importance of the availability of interpretive services. A particular concern was the issue of engagement with the services by non-national patients in receipt of alternative medical advice from outside the country.<\/p><p>  In order to improve standardisation and to drive service quality, the HSE's National Clinical Programme in Obstetrics and Gynaecology has been working on the development of national clinical guidelines; to date, 20 guidelines have been developed, eight are under review and a further 20 have been commissioned. It is important to state that no matter what definitions are used or how case ascertainment is conducted, that Ireland continues to be a very safe country for a woman to give birth and our safety record compares favourably with other developed countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Cases","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRV01250"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[19525\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Irish High Court maternity cases which have involved non-nationals.","asker":"1015","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>I understand that this question has been clarified with the Deputy and that she is seeking information concerning how many Irish high court maternity cases have involved non-nationals being brought to court by medical practitioners to compel them to undergo a procedure for which they do not give their consent.

Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve. The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  <\/p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the body charged with building the hospital. Following detailed consideration of the project management structures and governance arrangements required to enable delivery of the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality, I intend to restructure the NPHDB to focus on the core function of planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital.  The new Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, which brings together the three existing paediatric hospitals, will now lead on functions relating to service transfer planning, human resource planning, philanthropy etc. which were previously within the remit of the NPHDB.<\/p><p>  In line with its core function of building the hospital, the membership of the restructured NPHDB must include the expertise to deal with this very large and complex capital project. The necessary appointments are under consideration and, in the interim, a transitional Board is in place comprising officials from my Department and the HSE, ensuring continued governance and decision-making for the project. <\/p><p>  The transitional Board is progressing a number of immediate issues. In this first phase of the project, the focus is on reconciling the brief with the new site, site and site preparation and new procurement processes. A joint group involving the HSE and St James's Hospital are meeting regularly to progress the enabling and decant work required. A shared services group has been established to focus on identifying the facilities which can be shared so as to optimise the build. While much of the work that has been done for the project in its previous location on the Mater site is transferable to the new site, a new design for the new site is required and in this regard a priority now for the NPHDB is the procurement of a new design team. A review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and is expected to be complete within the coming weeks; this is key to finalising the scale of the facilities required on the St James&rsquo;s campus and informing the design. <\/p><p>  It is important to remember that, in addition to a new building, the new children's hospital entails the coming together of three existing paediatric hospitals (Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght).  I welcome the commitment expressed by the three existing hospitals to  becoming a single service well before the new hospital is built and the establishment of the new Children's Hospital Group, involving the three hospitals, is an important step in this regard. The  Group will have a non-statutory Board of Direction which will oversee the integration of services across the three hospitals, over time.  Dr Jim Browne has been appointed as its Chair, and will work closely with the Chairs of the three existing hospitals, who have welcomed his appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cochlear Implants","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[19630\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps his Department is taking to ensure that children can get bilateral cochlear implants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>Since the national cochlear implant programme commenced seventeen years ago, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants.

I have received Professor Higgins&rsquo; report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the Strategic Board.  I will shortly submit this report to Government, to consider and decide on the final formation of each hospital group.  I appreciate that this report and the related  government decision are anxiously awaited: however, this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the State&rsquo;s foundation and I take very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely, to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it. <\/p><p>  The Government will decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Issues","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[19697\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when details of a diagnosis will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":659,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[19723\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500060#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if and when a medical card will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":660,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Member States are also allowed to confine the allocation of payment entitlements to those farmers who received a payment under the existing Single Payment Scheme in either 2010 or 2011.

In the most recent World Health Statistics Annual Report (2012), Ireland had the 13th lowest rate of maternal mortality out of 178 countries reporting data.  It is generally recognised internationally that official vital statistics can result in an underestimate of maternal deaths.  In particular, indirect obstetric deaths resulting from previous existing disease or diseases which developed during the pregnancy may be missed in the official statistics. For this reason, Ireland established a Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) system in 2009.  In doing so, it linked itself with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Confidential MDE which has been acknowledged as a gold standard for maternal death enquiry in recent decades.  <\/p><p>  The MDE report shows that 75.4 per cent of maternities in Ireland in 2010 were women of Irish nationality and that 40% of all maternal deaths identified in the triennium 2009-2011 occurred in women who were not born in Ireland. There were 25 maternal deaths in the period, and 10 of these deaths were women not born in Ireland.  The report draws attention to how these women engage with Irish maternity services and the importance of the availability of interpretive services. A particular concern was the issue of engagement with the services by non-national patients in receipt of alternative medical advice from outside the country.<\/p><p>  In order to improve standardisation and to drive service quality, the HSE's National Clinical Programme in Obstetrics and Gynaecology has been working on the development of national clinical guidelines; to date, 20 guidelines have been developed, eight are under review and a further 20 have been commissioned. It is important to state that no matter what definitions are used or how case ascertainment is conducted, that Ireland continues to be a very safe country for a woman to give birth and our safety record compares favourably with other developed countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500065#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Cases","counter":807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500065#WRV01250"},{"type":"question","counter":808,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[19525\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500065#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Irish High Court maternity cases which have involved non-nationals.","asker":"1015","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":809,"content":"<p>I understand that this question has been clarified with the Deputy and that she is seeking information concerning how many Irish high court maternity cases have involved non-nationals being brought to court by medical practitioners to compel them to undergo a procedure for which they do not give their consent.

Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve. The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  <\/p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the body charged with building the hospital. Following detailed consideration of the project management structures and governance arrangements required to enable delivery of the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality, I intend to restructure the NPHDB to focus on the core function of planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital.  The new Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, which brings together the three existing paediatric hospitals, will now lead on functions relating to service transfer planning, human resource planning, philanthropy etc. which were previously within the remit of the NPHDB.<\/p><p>  In line with its core function of building the hospital, the membership of the restructured NPHDB must include the expertise to deal with this very large and complex capital project. The necessary appointments are under consideration and, in the interim, a transitional Board is in place comprising officials from my Department and the HSE, ensuring continued governance and decision-making for the project. <\/p><p>  The transitional Board is progressing a number of immediate issues. In this first phase of the project, the focus is on reconciling the brief with the new site, site and site preparation and new procurement processes. A joint group involving the HSE and St James's Hospital are meeting regularly to progress the enabling and decant work required. A shared services group has been established to focus on identifying the facilities which can be shared so as to optimise the build. While much of the work that has been done for the project in its previous location on the Mater site is transferable to the new site, a new design for the new site is required and in this regard a priority now for the NPHDB is the procurement of a new design team. A review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and is expected to be complete within the coming weeks; this is key to finalising the scale of the facilities required on the St James&rsquo;s campus and informing the design. <\/p><p>  It is important to remember that, in addition to a new building, the new children's hospital entails the coming together of three existing paediatric hospitals (Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght).  I welcome the commitment expressed by the three existing hospitals to  becoming a single service well before the new hospital is built and the establishment of the new Children's Hospital Group, involving the three hospitals, is an important step in this regard. The  Group will have a non-statutory Board of Direction which will oversee the integration of services across the three hospitals, over time.  Dr Jim Browne has been appointed as its Chair, and will work closely with the Chairs of the three existing hospitals, who have welcomed his appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500066#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cochlear Implants","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500067#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[19630\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500067#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps his Department is taking to ensure that children can get bilateral cochlear implants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>Since the national cochlear implant programme commenced seventeen years ago, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants.

We know that the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  Experience in Ireland and abroad teaches us that a co-ordinated system of care is clearly better for patients than a sporadic approach from hospital to hospital.

I will shortly submit this report to Government, to consider and decide on the final formation of each hospital group.  I appreciate that this report and the related  government decision are anxiously awaited: however, this is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the State&rsquo;s foundation and I take very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely, to assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it. <\/p><p>  The Government will decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015.

Secondly, to use the opportunity of St Patrick's Day to strengthen our bi-lateral relationship with other states and thirdly, to connect with our diaspora overseas as well as those individuals with a strong connection or affinity with Ireland.  \u00a0<\/p><p><b>Tuesday 12th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Travel<\/p><p><br \/>  \u00a0<b>Wednesday 13th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Arrival in Seoul, South Korea<\/p><p><br \/>  Briefing with Irish Embassy, Enterprise Ireland (EI)\u00a0and IDA\u00a0 <\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Irish Business Community and contacts<\/p><p><b>Thursday 14th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Global Irish Network member<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with IDA target company<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Minister for Patriots and Veterans Affairs\u00a0 <\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Seoul Finance Forum<\/p><p><br \/>  Interview with Korean media<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Minister for Culture, Tourism and Sport<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with EI clients<\/p><p><br \/>  National Day Reception<\/p><p><b>Friday 15th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Travel from Seoul, South Korea to Tokyo, Japan<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Japan Ireland Parliamentary Friendship League<\/p><p><br \/>  Working Lunch with Irish Embassy, Enterprise Ireland and IDA staff <\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Japan Rail East <\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with EI client<\/p><p><br \/>  Media Interview <\/p><p><br \/>  Irish National Day Reception <\/p><p><b>Saturday 16th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Yokohama St. Patrick's Day Parade &amp;amp; related functions<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with EI Clients<\/p><p><br \/>  Emerald Ball<\/p><p><b>Sunday 17th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Tokyo St. Patrick's Day Parade &amp;amp; related functions<\/p><p><b>Monday 18th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Members of the Global Irish Network<\/p><p><br \/>  Briefing for members of the Tourism Trade in Japan<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Japanese Vice-Minister for Land, Infrastructure and Transport<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Minister for Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with IDA client<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with Mitsui Busan\u00a0 <\/p><p><br \/>  Speak at Glen Dimplex seminar on Green Energy<\/p><p><b>Tuesday 19th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Travel to Osaka<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with IDA Client<\/p><p><br \/>  Meetings with Vice-Governor of Osaka Prefecture<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with EI client<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with IDA target<\/p><p><br \/>  Meeting with English Language School <\/p><p><br \/>  Irish National Day Reception, Osaka<\/p><p><b>Wednesday 20th March<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Depart Osaka<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500068#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Services Provision","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500068#WRY01400"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[19549\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042500068#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will clarify an issue in regard to fuel surcharges by airlines; and if there is any legislation in this area (details supplied)","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>There is no legislation governing charges such as fuel surcharges; airlines have complete freedom in setting their fares and rates since the air services market was deregulated in the EU in the early 1990s.
