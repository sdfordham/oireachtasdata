One of those is to have proper deadlines, accountability and figures delivered on time so that we are not examining figures which, in some cases, are six and seven years old.

The difficulty can arise if there is an accounting problem and there may not be the capacity on the other side to deal with it.  That can slow down some of the work.

Practically everything, except for the education sector, where there is a very particular problem, is due at the end of December.

There would be an opportunity to take everybody from the reporting side and put them into the process but then that leaves us with no reporting work being done and that area is already under strain.  To be quite honest, it is the reporting work that is generally more of a focus for the committee, rather than the financial statements.  We try to do as much work during the year of account as we can in the bigger entities, where it is efficient to do so, on an interim basis and to finish the audits of the financial statements of the bigger entities with higher turnovers and more critical issues so that they are done in the first half of the year.

Ultimately, I issue the audit opinion, not the contractors.  We contract in staff so as to boost the numbers available during the first half of the year.  We also have a general prohibition on staff taking leave in the first half of the year.  We are doing everything we can to maximise the resource that is available for the audit in the first half of the year but inevitably, then, it is the second half of the year, at management level, before we can turn to reviewing the financial statements of the smaller entities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600004#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1415268600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Is this because there has been a mushrooming of quangos?

There is also an issue in terms of the different agencies throughout the State in regard to how they account or how seriously they take their job as members of audit committees and so on.  I am concerned by a number of examples of this.  Tipperary Hostel was reported on here, but nothing constructive has come back from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, or any of the other Departments involved, in regard to that project.  We do our work.  We highlight the issues and in that case forwarded a note to the line Minister and the Department but got no real response in the letters we received.<\/p><p>  We also have the example of the Waterford Institute of Technology, which was in the news again recently.  There has been no clear cut ending to that examination.  This lack of a conclusion creates significant doubt around the organisations concerned and their ability to deliver as they should.  We received a report from Cork Institute of Technology and we constantly receive letters from the VEC, all complaining about the loose spending of taxpayers' money or governance issues.  However, we have not received a reply from the Department yet, even though it is some months since the report was made available to it.  We have had no response whatsoever.  Again, this is a question of how serious the Departments are about taking on board the issues raised at this committee and doing something to stop them arising again.<\/p><p>  The issue of time is also of significant concern, both to me and other committee members.  Last week, we dealt with the harbours accounts.  These date back over years and one of the buildings mentioned was going through a sale process for 21 years.  Surely somebody on the audit committee or involved in that process should have brought that issue to the attention of someone more senior.  In the context of new legislation etc., it appears that agencies do not acknowledge or do not step up to the plate in terms of their responsibilities.  As a result, we see a massive loss of taxpayers' money to the State and an undermining of the sector in terms of how it is viewed within and without the Department.<\/p><p>  We are all aware of the issues with the HSE.  All of these issues were highlighted and brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but nothing has been done about them.  There is little correction in the system.  I believe the time has come for an audit of the various agencies, with a particular emphasis on their governance, how they view it and what steps they have taken, in line with the new legislation, to ensure they are at the edge of best practice.  That is not happening currently.  For as long as that does not happen and for as long as there are no consequences for these agencies, the system just trundles on and the Committee of Public Accounts will remain in business and be as busy as ever for the foreseeable future.  That should not be the case.<\/p><p>  I suggest there is a need for a special report into governance issues for every organisation responsible to the Comptroller and Auditor General or for every organisation that presents its books to his office for audit.  Following that audit, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the political leadership within Departments can be informed of the position.  Somebody must take a stand on this issue, because there is a massive loss of public moneys.  It seems to me that everybody is quite happy for us to do our job here on a Thursday morning and then to turn a blind eye to the issues and walk away.  With respect, the ball is in the court of the Comptroller and Auditor General as much as it is in ours.  If it is a question of resources, this must be explained clearly to the Departments.  Someone must cry \"stop\", say that this will not happen again and point out the consequences.  This must be a policy issue, so that it is then for us to say -I am saying it now - there should be a consequence for every organisation that does not comply with the rules, just as happens in the private sector.  Until this policy is part of the system, we will not change the culture of the Comptroller and Auditor General reporting here on a Thursday morning and then going back to his desk and treating everything as if nothing ever happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600005#J00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1415269200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Of all the audits not certified by 31 October, the Comptroller and Auditor General said two thirds of them were with senior management.

The bottleneck appears to be at senior manager review level.  This begs the question whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has contracted people in or out at that level.  He says he has contracted out work at field work level, but the area requiring greater concentration is that of the manager review, after the field work is done.<\/p><p>  Following on what the Chairman has said, this discussion is pointless unless we raise this again at the Estimates meeting for the Vote for Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which will arise as part of the Estimates discussion for 2015.

Around 50,000 of these admissions occurred after emergency presentation for treatment.  The bulk of the surgical procedures, 80%, or just under 200,000 cases, were elective or planned surgery cases, and two thirds of these were treated on a day surgery basis.<\/p><p>  Day surgery refers to surgical treatment provided in hospital, generally under anaesthetic, where the patient is expected to return home on the same day.  It requires formal admission of the patient to the hospital and is different to minor surgical treatment provided in an outpatient clinic.  Day surgery has a number of benefits over the same procedure provided on an inpatient basis, where the patient occupies a hospital bed for one or more nights.  These benefits include reduced risk for patients of contracting a hospital-acquired infection and reduced costs for hospitals.  Properly managed, day surgery should also lead to a reduction in waiting time for elective procedures because of improved throughput of cases.<\/p><p>  Since 2006, the HSE has required acute hospitals to provide details of the total number of admissions and the number carried out as day surgery for 24 targeted surgical procedures.  The target procedures range across all the major specialties and accounted for 31% of all elective surgical procedures in 2012.  Appendix A lists the target procedures, together with a layman's description of each one.<\/p><p>  The examination was carried out to establish the extent to which there had been progress in switching the delivery of treatment from an inpatient to a day surgery basis, to identify factors that assist in that switch or that might be impeding it and to assess if there was scope for the use of day surgery to be extended.  In view of the specialist medical knowledge required regarding the nature of surgical procedures and hospital processes, we contracted in two experienced medical consultants based in the UK to assist the examination team drawn from my office.<\/p><p>  The examination report is presented in two main parts.  Chapter 2 presents an analysis of the available data on elective surgical procedures designed to identify key trends and outcomes at individual hospital and procedure level over the period since 2006.  Chapter 3 is a review of procedures adopted by hospitals in planning and delivering day surgery treatment and supporting patients after discharge.  It includes recommendations aimed at ensuring hospitals are in a position to deliver elective surgery in the most appropriate and effective setting.<\/p><p>  Figure 2.1 indicates that the volume of elective surgery reported by hospitals increased by around a quarter between 2006 and 2012.  There was a small reduction in the volume of elective surgery carried out on an inpatient basis.  This contrasts with a big increase in the volume of day surgery.  As a result, the proportion of elective surgery carried out on a day surgery basis increased from 55% to 69%.<\/p><p>  For the years 2009 to 2012, the HSE set all acute hospitals a target of achieving an overall day surgery rate of 75% for the set of 24 procedures.  In 2012, the rate achieved across all hospitals was 74%, just below the target.  However, there was significant variation in performance between the different acute hospitals that have a significant surgical case load.  In 2012, the day surgery rate for the target procedures in individual hospitals varied from 50% to 92%.<\/p><p>  The HSE specified only a single day surgery target rate even though existing practice varied widely for the different types of procedures.  The mix of surgical procedures varies between hospitals and this influences the overall hospital day surgery rate relative to the target.<\/p><p>  Figure 2.5 shows how treatment delivery has changed regarding each of the target procedures since 2006.  The diagram can be seen on the screens.  The darker bands indicate the balance between inpatient and day surgery in 2006, while the lighter bands show the 2012 balance.  Overall, the relative shift to the right of the lighter bands reflects a trend towards delivery of more treatment via day surgery.<\/p><p>  For some procedures there was little change over time in the balance between inpatient and day surgery.<\/p> <p>For example, more than 75% of operations for correction of a squint were carried out on an inpatient basis in 2006.  By 2012, the balance had reversed with 75% of squint correction carried out on a day surgery basis.  There have also been considerable shifts towards day surgery for removal of cataracts and to relieve a condition that results in contraction in the hand.  In contrast, there were only minor changes in the day surgery rates for tonsil removals and removal of bladder tumours.<\/p><p> It is notable that across hospitals several of the procedures targeted by the HSE for improvement in day surgery rates were already at or above the 75% day surgery level in 2006.  This included cases involving post-fracture removal of pins or plates, internal examinations of joints, treatment of glue ear and treatment for nasal fracture.<\/p><p> Some clinicians expressed the view to the examination team that several of the 24 target procedures monitored by the HSE are not suitable for day surgery.  This viewpoint may be reflected in very low day surgery rates for some high volume procedures, such as removal of tonsils, 5,200 cases in 2012, with an 8% day surgery rate and gall bladder removal, 3,700 cases in 2012 with a 27% rate.  The examination found that in three hospitals, the day surgery rate for gall bladder removal increased from 1% in 2006 to between 56% and 70% in 2012.  In other hospitals, the day surgery rate for gall bladder removal remained low at around 1%.  Figure 2.7 in my circulated paper indicates the very considerable variation that existed between hospitals in two other high-volume target procedures, namely laparoscopy and repair of hernia.  We found that across all hospitals, the day surgery rate increased for both procedures between 2006 and 2012 while the gap in performance between hospitals narrowed.<\/p><p> The overall conclusion from the data analysis is there has been a significant increase in the day surgery rate for many of the targeted procedures but that scope exists for further improvement.  We recommended the HSE should seek to identify the factors associated with increased day surgery rates and transferable good practices.  We also recommended that instead of a single global target, appropriate targets should be set for different procedures and that targets should be set for a wider range of elective procedures.  It is important to acknowledge that setting a target rate for day surgery for a category of procedure cannot override the professional judgment of the relevant clinicians in deciding on the appropriate delivery setting in any individual case which must take account of all factors, including the patient&rsquo;s condition and circumstances.<\/p><p> The HSE estimates day care surgery is, on average, almost 60% less costly than performing the same procedure on an inpatient basis.  However, both the HSE and the Department of Health have pointed out that because a high proportion of hospital costs are fixed in the short term, the full potential savings of a significant shift from inpatient to day surgery will not accrue immediately.  Related measures to reduce cost are also needed to achieve the potential cash savings.<\/p><p> The primary focus of the examination was on the procedures targeted by the HSE for monitoring and target setting.  However, we also looked at the trends in elective surgery that were not subject to targeting.  Figure 2.10 in my circulated paper presents a comparison of the numbers of targeted and non-targeted procedures reported which indicates a significant difference.  The total number of elective procedures carried out in the target categories increased by only 3% over the seven years.  Within the targeted procedures, it is evident the increase in day surgery admissions was broadly offset by a corresponding decrease in inpatient admissions.  This suggests a strong substitution effect which over time should yield savings or free up resources for other activity.  In marked contrast, the total number of elective procedures in non-target categories increased by 39% over the same period.  There was little change in the number of inpatient admissions for those procedures but a very striking 74% increase in day surgery admissions.  Underlying demographic changes such as an aging population are highly unlikely to explain a trend shift of that order of magnitude in one category without apparently affecting other categories.<\/p><p> The HSE concluded that an increasing number of minor surgical procedures are being carried out as day surgery cases when it would be more economical to carry them out in outpatient clinics or in primary care settings.  It estimates it would be more appropriate to carry out as many as three in five of the non-target day surgery treatments in other settings and at less cost.  It attributes this shift to the incentive effect of the current method of funding of hospitals under which the payment rate for a procedure performed in a day surgery setting is higher than if the same procedure is performed, appropriately, in an outpatient setting.  This is an inefficient outcome and I have recommended the HSE should closely monitor cases currently classified as day surgery with a view to ensuring that all hospitals direct surgical cases to the most appropriate and economical settings.<\/p><p> The examination included a survey of hospitals and site visits to a number of hospitals where the medical consultants examined the processes around management and delivery of day surgery.  The results were measured against criteria identified by the medical consultants based on established good practice for day surgery is UK hospitals.  Procedures were examined at each stage of the day surgery pathway which is outlined in figure 3.1 in my report.  Recommendations are presented in the report aimed at achieving improvements in the way day surgery is managed in hospitals.  The HSE has agreed to implement the recommendations.  It remains to be seen what impact this will have on efficiency and cost in the delivery of elective surgery, as well as on the quality of the service provided to patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600006#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415270400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. McCarthy.

I will, therefore, confine my opening statement to highlight a number of key issues for the HSE.  I welcome the report and the HSE is well under way to implement its recommendations.  Staff from the HSE worked closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide much of the information contained in the report and to share with his staff examples of the current work we are already engaged in this area.<\/p><p>  The key recommendations of the report are to improve and to reduce variation in day surgery rates, to drive more standardised approaches, to improve information for patients, to optimise the locations for day surgery, to streamline business processes, improve funding arrangements and to better manage hospital performance with regard to surgery services.  It is important to note the HSE had a specific focus on both elective and day surgery rates for several years with each successive improvement approach adding to impacts seen.  For example, we have seen day case activity rise from 675,162 to 838,922 discharges between 2009 and 2013, a rise of 24% in activity volumes which translates into an additional 163,760 patients seen on a day case basis.  During this time, most of the additional patients seen came as a result of specific improvements in the utilisation of resources and capacity by hospitals.<\/p><p>  As part of our service planning process, the HSE sets a range of access and performance targets.  Each year, the one area where the HSE has consistently exceeded its target is in the provision of day case treatments.  However, in parallel to focusing on improvements in the areas of day case, the HSE has also focused on ensuring overall elective surgery services are improved.  It is important to note our surgical inpatient activity rates increased from 417,846 in 2010 to 484,167 in 2013, an increase of almost 16% or 66,321 cases.  At the same time, we have reduced the number of bed days for this group meaning that the length of stay of patients has significantly reduced while utilising our surgery resources more efficiently.  Our current target length of stay is 5.3 days and in 2014 it is 5.2 days.  We intend to target further reductions in 2015.<\/p><p>  We are making overall surgery more efficient with a shorter inpatient stay and not just focusing on day case procedures alone.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, we have also seen improvements in our day of surgery admission, DOSA, rate which currently stands at 64%.  We have further work to reach our target of 85% across all hospitals and we will talk further about that during our session this morning.<\/p><p> To give committee members a summary of how the HSE has and will be targeting improvements in the area of elective day surgery, I will highlight some examples from our overall approach.  That approach has been in three broad areas: redesigning surgery service delivery, which is an important element of a larger reform programme; facilitating numerous initiatives at a local level; and implementing performance monitoring and management systems to consistently track and drive improvements in the key surgical areas.  I will briefly highlight a number of elements and key initiatives in each of these domains to illustrate the important work that is ongoing.<\/p><p> From a redesign and reform perspective, we see optimising utilisation of surgery resources and providing clarity for hospitals about their roles as key deliverables in our overarching reform agenda.  Our approach seeks to provide consistency across regions in the standards for surgery and to deliver efficiencies through networking the delivery of surgery between hospitals in the new hospital groups.  Improvement in surgery services and other areas of activity in acute hospitals will be significantly facilitated by the changes that come with the establishment of hospital groups and subsequently trusts.  This is because hospital group boards and executives will be able to be more responsive to local demands while being accountable for a much more manageable size of entity.  We have already quite successfully targeted a number of smaller hospitals to increase elective and day surgery activity volumes within them.  The national clinical programmes are also working within the HSE to address acute and elective surgery efficiency and effectiveness.  The  relevant programmes in this respect are surgery, anaesthesia, major trauma and orthopaedics.<\/p><p> The surgery clinical programme has prepared and launched two special reports on the appropriate models of care for acute and elective surgery in Ireland.  I am very pleased to have Professor Frank Keane with me today, because in his role as lead of the surgery program he has been instrumental in driving the majority of the improvements we have seen.  The HSE is also working closely with the anaesthetics clinical programme on a pre-admission model of care, which will be launched in December.  Our new approach to funding episodes of care, called Money Follows the Patient, or activity-based funding, will also provide an opportunity to better incentivise day case models.<\/p><p> With regard to facilitating improvements at the front line, we are rolling out a range of surgery-related improvement initiatives.  The productive operating theatre, TPOT, programme is a joint quality improvement initiative between the HSE, the Royal College of Surgeons, RCSI, and the College of Anaesthetists, CAI.  TPOT is now operational in 17 hospitals nationally.  The TPOT programme is designed to enable hospitals to continuously improve across four quality domains, which include patient experience and outcomes, safety and reliability of care, team performance and staff well-being and value and efficiency.  In conjunction with the anaesthetic clinical programme, the HSE will be implementing a range of pre-admission clinics across hospitals nationally.  Currently about 90% have anaesthetic pre-admission clinics.  Pre-admission encompasses the entire process around the peri-operative management of a patient scheduled for surgery, be it a day case or an inpatient being admitted on the day of their operation.<\/p><p> Importantly, we have recently started rolling out a web-enabled interactive reporting tool called NQAIS that uses a hospital's own surgery data to present information in a user-friendly way.  This encourages better management by surgeons, clinical directors and hospital managers of their local surgery resources.  We have commenced work with the primary care sector to improve standardisation of GP referral pathways and thresholds for referral.  We will also be driving better compliance with the recommendations which arise from the various HIQA health technology assessments so that surgery is only performed when there is an appropriate evidence base.<\/p><p> We are more rigorously managing surgery performance at hospital and hospital group levels.  Targets have been set globally and individually for each hospital in respect of day case rates and DOSA rates. These are regularly monitored in the HSE and the subject of on-going discussions with hospitals.  The HSE has developed and expanded its range of surgery indicators and will include these in its 2015 national service plan, which we are currently finalising. This is all being done within a performance framework for hospital groups in which I meet with each of the individual hospital group executives monthly to analyse their recent performance across a balanced scorecard and we agree improvement strategies.<\/p><p> There remain challenges to the HSE to successfully implement our goals.  We acknowledge that there is a need to focus on continuing to move minor surgical cases and less complex care to less intensive environments such as out-patient departments and the community.  This requires changes to practice and infrastructure and the alignment of payment approaches with these goals.  Similarly, despite the significant efforts of hospitals and clinicians, there continues to be pressure on waiting lists for scheduled care as unscheduled care demands continue to rise and hospitals struggle to discharge patients ready for placement in the community to nursing homes and other supported community settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600007#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415271000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell for his statement.

In going through the report I wish to compliment them on the Comptroller and Auditor General's observation that from 2009 to 2012, the HSE set a 75% target day surgery rate for all acute hospitals for the 24 procedures and reached a rate of 74%.  It is rare that we see targets actually being reached, so I compliment the witnesses on that.  However, the next sentence says that there is a significant variation in performance rates between the individual hospitals.  This variation can be dramatic, ranging from 50% to 92%.  Reading between the lines of the report, some clinicians expressed the view that the 24 target procedures are not suitable for day surgery.  Another one mentions that consultants and so forth were possibly objecting.  Is it the case that the variance is due to individual consultants in individual hospitals who have a different view to the HSE on how certain day case procedures should be treated and that they would rather these procedures were treated as in-patient surgeries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600008#M00400","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415271000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I can give Deputy Nolan the latest figures.  We have the year-to date 2014 figures on that basket of 24 procedures to which he referred.  For the 41,500 cases this year to date the day case rate is now up to 77%, so we are continuing to improve.  However, Deputy Nolan is correct, there is a variance between the rates for individual procedures.  I might just quote a handful of them to give an example.  Procedures which everyone is quite comfortable doing as day cases have quite high rates.  For example, removing a ganglion, which is a swelling in a tendon in the hand, or orchiopexy, or repairing a nasal fracture.  Each of these have rates of day case procedures that are well in the 90s.  The four that are lowest are tonsillectomy at only 10%, 18% for bunions, 34% for transurethral resection of the prostate and 34% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  I think bunions are an aberration, but tonsillectomy is a good example of the answer to the question the Deputy is raising, namely whether consultants are comfortable with doing these procedures as day cases.<\/p><p>  Tonsillectomy is something which ENT surgeons and anaesthetists have been quite uncomfortable about doing as a day case procedure.  It has taken many years across the globe for practice to change in this regard, because they all remember cases of a bleeding that first night after the tonsillectomy which was horrendous, which was in the airway and which threatened the life of the patient, requiring them to come in from home to almost repeat the tonsillectomy in order to get the bleeding under control.  They are plagued by the memory of these cases from the past, which make them uncomfortable saying that they are going to change their entire practice to doing every tonsillectomy as a day case.  They will change over time and that rate will increase, but they must be reassured that there are systems in place where a patient can come in from home rapidly, where their entry to the hospital's emergency department will be accelerated and where the time between leaving home and getting to the operating theatre is not so long that they expire from the haemorrhage.  It is uncommon for a haemorrhage to occur on that first night after the operation but it is such a worrying event that it has swayed the opinions of doctors.<\/p> <p> I was pleased that, in his opening statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that we cannot have metrics overriding professional judgement.  Ultimately, we have to convince our surgeons that their practice needs to change, and convincing independent, strong-willed people like competent surgeons is a challenge.  This is the reason there will always be some variation.  The other reason there will be variation is that there is a different range of numbers of cases in each of those 24 procedures in the various hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600008#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415271600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Could Dr. O'Connell repeat that line?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600009#N00200","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415271600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>There will be a range of numbers of cases in each of those 24.

It has been difficult to persuade hearts and minds that the systems are in place for people to manage these patients safely.  A combination of coaxing and persuasion of hearts and minds is required.<\/p><p>  I have been in surgical practice for 30 years.  When I started out we did absolutely nothing as day cases.

There is an intuitive comfort factor in knowing they are in safe hands.  For the first while doing them as day cases, the surgeon goes home and thinks, \"My God, what is happening to my patient tonight, how are they?\"  Returning to what Dr. O'Connell said about tonsils, it is very emotive on a practice basis.  Many of the patients are children and people are very uneasy about the prospect of a child being put at risk because they bleed torrentially after they go home and something terrible happens to them.  It is quite a significant risk, in other words.  <\/p><p>  When we try to encourage people to do day cases, the constant response is, \"What will happen if I send somebody home and they bleed to death?  Where will I be then?  I can see it all over the newspapers\".  It is difficult to persuade people.  It takes leaders and we can see that there are some places that are now doing much more, up to 20% or 25% of tonsillectomies being carried out as day cases.  It is usually those people, the pathfinders, who show that it is safe and then it gradually trickles into the system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600009#N01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415271600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>If I could add another aspect of variance to the answer to Deputy Nolan's question.

Strictly, a day surgery unit is an equipped operating theatre that gives a general anaesthetic in which one does substantive day case work, not the relatively trivial operations which Deputy Nolan identified.  There is no question that because of facilities and the number of operating theatres in certain hospitals that they are having to carry out all their inpatient work and their outpatient or day case work within the same resource.<\/p> <p>That is an historical fact because that is what we are dealing with.  A county hospital with four operating theatres will be providing a range of inpatient treatments in a number of different surgical specialties such as orthopaedics, obstetrics, gynaecology, paediatrics and ENT from those four operating theatres.  One must fit that into a week's work.  One must also carry out the day stuff through there.  The best way to do day surgery is to run it in effect as a factory in order that there is a set-up that allows one to process patients through dedicated admission wards and dedicated operating theatres and then out the other end.  Processing patients sounds a bit callous because it makes it sound like an industry, but to a certain extent it works best like that.<\/p><p> There is a process of transition within the groups of hospitals becoming dedicated day centres where this kind of process works much more efficiently.  The way a majority of surgeons work their operating time in the theatre is often to do two day cases at the beginning of the list and then do the rest of the inpatient operations.  I have done this for a long period.  That is fine but it does not work the day case system as efficiently as it should be worked.  It does not work the beds so it is better if it is isolated.  It will take time for that system to evolve, especially at this particular moment.  This does create efficiencies.<\/p><p> Certainly there are things being done as day cases in day theatres that are inappropriate because they do not require a general anaesthetic and that needs to be sorted.  Part of the problem with that and the reason it did not happen up to this point is because people are not incentivised to perform these things, even in the outpatient department.  The reason is because one does not get a coded procedure.  The hospital, and nobody else, gets funded for that activity if it is done in the outpatients department because outpatient procedures are not coded.  In many cases, patients in minor operation rooms that hospitals operate do not get coded so they are missing out.  Clearly, that needs to be gradually corrected, and the money follows the patient exercises will do that.  These things must become coded activities in order that they start being done in the right place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600010#O01700","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415272800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Are activities with no coding that are taking place in hospitals being coded as something else?

A hospital might provide ophthalmic surgeons and surgery and do a considerable amount of cataract surgery.  We know that 95% of cataract surgery is done as a day case, so that will skew that hospital which will find it much easier to reach that target of 75%, 80% or whatever it is.  If a hospital only carries out laparoscopic cholecystectomies and tonsillectomies, about which we have been talking, it will find it very hard to reach that 75%.  Different hospitals have very different specialty mixes and using that 75% figure to compare hospitals in terms of their performance is not terribly effective.  What is much more effective is looking at individual procedures.  This is what we are doing now with the nursing instrument for quality assurance, NIQA, system described by Dr. O'Connell where we are feeding back to clinicians data that are now as close as three months old.  One must remember that this has only just come about because, before that, we were showing them data that were a year to a year and a half old, which is not meaningful for a practising clinician in terms of changing their practice.  We have this system that looks at individual procedures.  Not only does it tell individuals or individual specialty units what their performance is, it sets them a target for each of those procedures and compares them with national targets, national activities relating to what is going on and the best in class, so to speak.

We have clinical directors who are now responsible for only a handful of hospitals rather than, for instance, me being responsible for all 50 of them.  It is not possible for me to dive down into the individual performance and check the clinical indication for day case versus inpatient case by individual surgeons without doing an enormous amount of work.  Having a clinical director for just a handful of hospitals with sub-clinical directors in each individual hospital is a much better way to get a mindset and an approach and a consensus change in practice rather than doing it on a national level.

It is only when one becomes more granular in terms of looking at either specialties or individuals' procedures that differences begin to show.<\/p><p>  Another issue is that readmission rates can be difficult to quantity because we do not have a system of unique patient identifiers.

Public service cards, complete with photographic ID, are being issued to people for use in their dealings with social welfare offices and Revenue.  We are being told today that the HSE is not part of that system and, for some reason, patients cannot use the public service cards that have been issued across the board.  When the property tax was introduced last year, it was possible to match every home in the country with the relevant PPS numbers.  As I said already, there has been no difficulty with Irish Water accessing PPS numbers.  Yet patients cannot be identified in this way.  It is a bizarre situation.<\/p><p>  Will the delegates speak to Revenue or the Department of Social Protection and ask one of them to design a system for the HSE?  The HSE should not be spending its money on this; it is a public service issue.  I have a list a mile long of organisations that can share PPS numbers across the public service, including Revenue, local authority housing departments and social welfare offices.  That system should be extended to include the HSE.  I am amazed that the delegates are apparently determined to reinvent the wheel.  The submission tells us there were 838,922 day case discharges in 2013.  On that basis, I would estimate that 1.2 million or 1.3 million people go through the hospital system every year, including inpatients, outpatients and day patients.  All of those people have PPS numbers, but the delegates want to spend time and money developing a whole new system.  The HSE's resources are simply too valuable to be spent in this way.

What we are recommending is that we try to create situations in hospitals where there will be a surgeon on call to deal specifically with emergencies.

I have raised the issue of the accident and emergency service in the past.  The new emergency department that is under construction in Limerick is very welcome.  It appears that it will not be up and running until 2016.  Could more be done to free up beds in the regional hospital in Limerick?  I am aware that people have been transferred from that hospital to St. John's Hospital.  We need to take the pressure off the accident and emergency department in the regional hospital in Limerick until the new emergency department is opened.  HIQA said recently that the existing department is not fit for purpose.  We need to do something to bridge the gap over the next year - this coming winter and the following winter.  Dr. O'Connell is probably aware of the proposals that have been made.  The medical assessment unit that is operating at the hospital is, in effect, a day facility.  If it were to be converted into a temporary inpatient facility adjacent to the accident and emergency department, perhaps it could relieve some of the current problems.  Dr. O'Connell is familiar with the ongoing pressures that have resulted from the reconfiguration within the region.  I refer, for example, to the decrease in the number of beds.  The emergency department at the regional hospital in Limerick is now the only such department in the mid-west region.  There is no other level 3 hospital in the region.  Everything is being funnelled into one hospital.  Dr. O'Connell might give me his overall perspective.  I suppose I am trying to be constructive.  This is an ongoing issue in Limerick and the mid-west as a whole.  I supported the proposal to move the existing 30-bed medical assessment unit to another part of the hospital to allow an area that is beside the current accident and emergency department to be used as an inpatient facility - a type of a spillover from the accident and emergency department - for the next year until the new emergency department is up and running.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600017#V00100","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415276400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised some important points.

After they have had their more complicated procedures in the largest hospital, they could move back to a hospital closer to home for the lower-acuity end of their stay in hospital.  We have already started to provide for much more use of Ennis and Nenagh hospitals along these lines.  I referred earlier to the increase in day cases and things like endoscopies, etc.  The Deputy also raised the separate issue of how to make more appropriate use of the beds that are available.  I am disinclined to promote use of the medical assessment unit because I think its advantage lies in its ability to churn patients through rapidly.

As a Deputy who represents the constituency of Limerick City, I regularly get telephone calls very late at night telling me about people, many of whom are elderly, who are on trolleys.  I am acting on this purely because that is my role.  I am bringing it to Dr. O'Connell's attention that the number of people who are on trolleys on an ongoing basis is a major issue.  There is a factual reason for it.  A number of years ago - not too long ago - there were 35 accident and emergency beds between Ennis and Nenagh hospitals, St. John's Hospital and the regional hospital in Limerick.  Seventeen of these beds were in the regional hospital.  Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals had six beds each.  The 18 beds in those three hospitals are gone.  They no longer have 24-hour, functioning accident and emergency departments.  The regional hospital continues to have just 17 beds.  The number of beds has been halved.  It is a major problem as we come into the real winter months, when the weather gets very bad.  We have already had some problems even though the weather has been relatively mild.  What can be done to ensure I no longer receive telephone calls at 11 p.m. or 12 midnight from people who have been on trolleys for many hours?  The staff in the regional hospital are excellent.  When one rings them, they deal with it.  People are working within very difficult confines.<\/p><p>  We have a unique set of circumstances.  HIQA, which is an independent body, has said it is not fit for purpose.  It is clear that the reconfiguration has resulted in a reduction in the number of accident and emergency beds.  Obviously, this falls directly under Dr. O'Connell's remit.  I appreciate that he is here for another purpose today.  Given that this is about beds, I think it falls within the same context.  What can be done?  I acknowledge that a new accident and emergency department is being built.  I would have liked to have seen it being developed more quickly.  We are now being told that it will be in place in early 2016 and that it will be a state-of-the-art facility when the physical structure is there and is fitted.  What can the HSE do to ensure additional bed capacity is available for people who are coming through the accident and emergency department at the regional hospital in Limerick over the period until the new emergency department is up and running in 2016?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600017#V00900","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415276400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>As I have said-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600017#V01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1415276400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy O'Donnell to conclude after this reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014110600017#V01100","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1415276400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I will.

I wish to mention one other item.  I refer to the reply to the question regarding the liabilities incurred by the Exchequer due to the Irish aviation superannuation scheme.  I am not sure if I have taken the right implications from the reply.  It suggests that all liabilities, duties, etc. were transferred when Shannon Development became a commercial enterprise to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am concerned that there is a major debate taking place on the IAS scheme and whether certain liabilities on the pension scheme was picked by the Department.  At present the vast majority of the people covered by the scheme in terms of deferred pensions, whether they are active or retired, have a major controversy raging.  People wonder whether this matter was dealt with prior to the commercialisation of Shannon Development for those employees who came under the scheme in that remit.

The topic is something we have discussed on a regular basis in the past three and a half years.  There are many examples.  Let us suppose company A tenders for a local authority project.  Company A will have the necessary length of time in existence, the necessary insurance capacity, the necessary funds and the necessary turnover, etc.  Company A then wins the tender and employs staff through another associated company.  Usually these companies have the same directors.  This is known as a corporate veil.  A paper wall is built within one entity, creating two entities, in an effort to achieve a specific objective.  In the case I have in mind, company B, which employed the staff, then went to the Labour Court and argued that it could not afford the rates of pay and was in a position in which it was about to collapse.  The determination was that there would be some decrease in the wages of the staff as a result.  We have seen this with retail outlets as well.  We have also seen it in certain insolvency cases whereby certain people maintained they could not afford redundancy payments, etc.  It is an important issue.<br\/>The <i>status quo<\/i>has the effect, in the construction, waste disposal and retail sectors, of significantly reducing people's rights, entitlements, wages and conditions, and often their redundancy and future pensions.  I have sought information and advice on the matter.  Previously the view was that constitutionally nothing could be done because a corporate entity was a specific person in front of the law.  I understand that although we may attribute a criminal offence to such individuals, it cannot be done.  Anyway there is no doubt in my mind that there have been cases before the Labour Relations Commission whereby company B has been made responsible for the actions of company A.  For example, I know of a case in which an individual employed people under a transport name to, mar dhea, transport items to a construction site.  Then, on the construction site, those individuals were involved in construction.  The purpose was to avoid paying the rate agreed under the registered employment agreement for the construction site.  This amounted to wholesale manipulation of the loophole for the benefit of unscrupulous employers and to the detriment of the workers.  It is interesting that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has supported this particular amendment and said that it is a necessary measure.  I am requesting that the Minister support the amendment to pierce the corporate veil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014110600014#P00400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1415281500,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 13 is not appropriate, as section 6(2) already provides for criminal liability for certain persons connected to a body corporate in certain circumstances.  In the case of offences under this Act, extending liability for the debts of an insolvent company to the officers of the company would, I am advised by the Attorney General, be constitutionally suspect and would represent a major departure in company law.<\/p><p>  The overriding principle of company law is that a director's duties are owed to the company and not to the individual shareholders or employees.  If there is a breach of duty on the part of a director which causes damage to the company, he can be sued or held liable for damages.  Claims can be brought by shareholders, by a financial institution or on a director-versus-director basis.  Liability may arise out of lack of care and skill in the performance of the director's duties, negligent advice or a misstatement.  Any act which goes beyond the limits of the company's constitution, such as excessive borrowing, unauthorised payments, failure to disclose the full extent of the director's interests or a failure to comply with requirements, may involve a director or officer in personal liability.<\/p><p>  Company law penalties vary from restriction or disqualification orders to fines and periods of imprisonment.  The Companies Bill provides for a four-tier categorisation for most of the offences, with the exception of fraudulent trading and market abuse.  The Companies Bill also contains a new provision in section 872 whereby, following conviction for an offence under the Companies Act, a trial judge can order that the convicted person should remedy any breach of the Companies Act in respect of which he was convicted.  In effect, the provisions of the Companies Bill amount to a more constitutionally robust rewording of section 383 of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 100 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.  From a company law perspective, the proposed amendment challenges the entire principle of company law.  If it were to be implemented, the doctrine of separately legal personality would become a exception rather than the rule.<\/p><p>  Having regard to the foregoing, I am not going to accept the amendment.  What the Deputy is suggesting is, on the advice of the Attorney General, not something I can accept.  We are looking to have new enforcement procedures under this Bill.  This is one of the areas we are seeking to improve.  Where there is a breach and a finding for the worker, the idea is that it becomes easier to enforce such cases, and that is being provided for in this legislation.
