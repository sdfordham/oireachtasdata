The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 613,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children.  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, is an important source of income for all families.  Since becoming Minister for Social Protection, I have strongly defended the universality of child benefit because the State values every child and supports families.  The fact that every family receives child benefit, regardless of their employment status, also ensures that there is not a disincentive to work.  Any changes to the child benefit payment rate will be a matter for Government, to be considered as part of the annual budget and estimates process and I am not in a position to comment further at this time.<\/p><p>  In addition to child benefit, the social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment.  Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.  In the interest of achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate.  Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[33191\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will look at the case of a person (details supplied) who is three years homeless and seven months pregnant with one daughter in school in Bray and who is unable to find any accommodation within the rent allowance caps; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>No application for rent supplement has been received in respect of the person concerned.

The unfair dismissals legislation falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. However, I understand it provides for social welfare payments received after their dismissal to be disregarded in calculating the person&rsquo;s financial loss.  Therefore, the person is not penalised for having been in receipt of a social welfare payment following their dismissal.  The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees where their employer is insolvent in line with the legislation governing the scheme. These include wages, holiday pay, and various statutory awards made by the EAT and the Rights Commissioners, including awards under the unfair dismissals legislation. The Minister becomes a preferential creditor with regard to payments made under the scheme.   <\/p><p>  Generally, where the employer is continuing to trade, the Department would not be aware, and would have no reason to be aware, that a person had received an award under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.

In addition, to do so could be inequitable, it would likely be administratively complex and it may have implications for the unfair dismissals process as a whole.

Recognising the urgency required in tackling the challenge of youth joblessness, the EPSCO Council quickly agreed on the Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee in February.  The Government and the Department were at the forefront of securing agreement on the adoption of the EU Council Recommendation on the Youth Guarantee.  The Recommendation is that Member States should: <i>Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education<\/i>  .<\/p><p>  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014 - 2020 EU Budget in February, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the Youth Guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment. This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line.  Proposals supported by the Irish Presidency that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose be used in 2014 and 2015 were approved by the European Council last month. In addition, the European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy intimated in the final days of the Irish Presidency that a further &euro;2 billion may be available, arising from proposed changes to the  EU's Multiannual Finance Framework. <\/p><p>  It is recognised, both in the Youth Guarantee Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State. At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented.  For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013.

All primary application forms are designed to facilitate the use of scanning and automated processing.  This ensures that the application is processed as efficiently as possible and that customers receive their entitlement in a timely manner.  Primary application forms are regularly reviewed, including those parts of forms that relate to the provision of medical evidence, to ensure they request only the information required to establish the customer&rsquo;s entitlement, in a clear and easy to understand manner.  A key aspect of this review is customer feedback and a number of channels are used for this including consultative fora, customer panels and a formal complaints process.<\/p><p>  In support of their application for medical based schemes, customers are advised to submit all medical evidence they have in support of their claim.  The disability and illness related schemes require that all available medical evidence is assessed by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors (MAs) and this, together with other qualifying criteria such as means testing, qualifying contributions, etc. are taken into account in assessing claims. In addition to application forms which are completed by trained medical professionals (GPs), all applicants are encouraged to provide as much additional information in support of their case as they wish, in the form of additional papers, medical reports, test results, scans, X-rays, etc.  All medical evidence submitted is considered by the Department&rsquo;s MAs as part of their assessment.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the initiatives underway in the Department, the improvements in processes and procedures supported by the redesign of application forms, and the Department&rsquo;s use of modern technology will continue to deliver an improved and efficient service to customers.

Preparations are underway in Ballyfermot and Bishop's Square and it is expected that these offices will be completed by the end 2013 and during 2014 respectively.<\/p><p>  The Department expects to relinquish the lease of the Thomas Street premises and earlier this year the Office of Public Works sought expressions of interest from landlords and their agents for a new premises to service the customers of that office.  A number of options have been explored and negotiations have commenced.  Given that this is new accommodation and given the scale of the project it is expected to be delivered in 2014.   With regard to the rollout of Intreo offices I can advise the Deputy that the first twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert a further 31 offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices. Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year. <\/p><p>  The Intreo roll-out is being supported by a training and development plan for all offices to equip staff and management to deliver this new service.  The Department's centralised training section, Staff Development Unit, works in partnership with a dedicated Intreo Project Team and local management to address identified training needs for each Office in preparation for the provision of the new service to customers. All of the training is being developed and delivered by in-house training resources and, to date, there has been no expenditure on external providers for Intreo-related training.  Where additional training is required following the introduction of the new service, this is provided on an on-going basis.<\/p><p>  Management and staff are receiving training in a range of areas including decision-making, the habitual residence condition, community welfare service awareness, customer service, change management, non-violent crisis intervention, presentation skills and internal IT systems training.  These training programmes range from one half-day session to two weeks in duration.  Former F&Aacute;S employment service officers, who joined the Department in January 2012, undertook Adult Guidance and Education training at NUI Maynooth as part of their role-specific development. They continue to use these skills in their daily interaction with customers regarding activation into employment or education. <\/p><p>  The Department is currently developing a training course for newly-appointed case officers to equip them with the skills necessary to operate in this new role and this may include an external training element.  In addition, the Department is beginning a process to review and redesign its functional training programmes, focusing on the business skills required for key frontline roles in the organisation, with a view to preparing these programmes for future accreditation. A Request For Tender will issue in this regard later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA03650"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[33270\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide details of each social protection scheme; the annual cost of each scheme; and the numbers availing of the payment for each of the past three years.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is collated by the Department annually for inclusion in the Statistical Information on Social Welfare Services report which is laid before the D&aacute;il when published and copies lodged in the Oireachtas library.

The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;1.06 billion in 2012 and is estimated to be &euro;935 million in 2013.  In 2013, on foot of the OFP reforms which came into effect on 4 July, it is expected that up to 9,300 recipients will leave the OFP scheme. Up to 8,000 of these will lose entitlement this month.  These numbers reflect the maximum number of cases who may lose entitlement in 2013.  This reform is expected to yield estimated savings of &euro;3.94m in 2013.<\/p><p>The reforms to the OFP scheme are predicated on activation and on getting customers who may have experienced recurring poverty and social exclusion traps back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) figures published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in February, 2013, show that, in 2011, 16.4% of lone parents in Ireland were experiencing &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; &ndash; compared to 6.9% of the population as a whole.  In order to address these issues, I am introducing reforms to the OFP scheme that aim to ensure better long-term outcomes for lone parents and their families.<\/p><p>It is expected that the majority of those who will lose their entitlement to the OFP payment will apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) scheme.  Lone parents who apply for JA and whose youngest child is under 14 years of age can avail of the new JA transition arrangement.  The JA transition arrangement is provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2013 and is a specific measure for lone parents transitioning from OFP to JA, whose youngest child is under 14 years of age. Customers who avail of this arrangement will be exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They will also be exempt from having to prove unemployment and be able to work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA payment &ndash; subject to a means test.<\/p><p>The JA transition arrangement recognises the difficulty of parenting alone and will ease the transition of former OFP recipients with children of primary school age onto the JA scheme.  Without it, it is likely that many former OFP recipients would not have qualified for the JA payment as their caring responsibilities may have prevented them from being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  Significantly, the JA transition arrangement will still require that this group of customers fully engage with my Department&rsquo;s full activation process. This is the same requirement that applies to all other jobseekers.<\/p><p>The OFP reforms are designed to provide the necessary supports to enable lone parents improve their skills and enhance their prospects of progressing into employment. As part of this process lone parents who transition to the jobseeker schemes will have access to the full range of supports and services provided under my Department&rsquo;s activation service.<\/p><p>The following table outlines the savings, as announced, for budget measures that affected OFP recipients only in Budgets 2011, 2012 and 2013.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th><div>Measures<\/div><\/th><th><div>Savings<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td><div>Reduction in the weekly rates of payment on OFP of &euro;8 to &euro;188 per week<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;38.56m<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td><div>Reduction in the age of the youngest child for payment of OFP, reduction in the earnings dis-regard and cessation of the 6 month transitional payment on OFP<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;15.3m<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td><div>Continued implementation of the 2012 reforms.<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;36.97m<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>OFP recipients may have been affected by other budget measures in the last three years that also affected other social welfare recipients such as changes to the child benefit scheme, fuel allowance etc.  These savings are not included in the above table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Guarantee","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA04250"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[33256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of young persons under 25 years of age who have received an offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education since the youth guarantee scheme was announced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It is recognised, both in the Youth Guarantee Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State.  At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented. For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013.<\/p><p>  The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland.   The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  Development of an implementation plan will include identification of the costs of implementation, and how it is envisaged that these will be met - how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely requirement from EU funds, e.g. ESF and YEI.  The amount that would be required for Ireland will only become clear when the implementation plans are drawn up. <\/p><p>  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014 &ndash; 2020 EU Budget in February, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the Youth Guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment.  This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line. <\/p><p>  Proposals supported by the Irish Presidency that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose be used in 2014 and 2015 were approved by the European Council last month.  In addition, the European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy intimated in the final days of the Irish Presidency that a further &euro;2 billion may be available, arising from proposed changes to the EU&rsquo;s Multiannual Finance Framework.  The precise amount that will be available to Ireland from the EU funds is also as yet unclear.  Until clarity is provided on this issue, the finalisation of any implementation plan will not be possible.<\/p><p>  In terms of a starting point to implementation, we sought funding from the European Commission (&euro;250,000) for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area.  I am pleased to say that our submission was one of those approved by the commission for funding and I expect that the Ballymun project will commence later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code Issues","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA04450"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[32892\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900058#WRA04500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to bring in legislation to deduct maintenance orders from social welfare payments where the court order is ignored.","asker":"1015","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>Under family law provisions, it is possible to apply to the court for an Attachment of Earnings Order.

The Department also availed, following an open tender process, of expert international advice.  Arising from this evaluation, the Cabinet Committee on Pathways to Work approved in principle a proposal to tender for the provision of employment services and agreed to the issue Prior Information Notice (PIN),  which was published on 28 June.  This notice formally notifies the market that the State intends to procure employment services.  A PIN is a discretionary and exploratory first step in a procurement process.  The publication of a PIN will enable the State to engage with potential vendors and other interested parties to gauge the level of market interest and will assist in finalising tender\/contract design.  A final decision on whether or not to proceed to full tender, and if so in what form, will be made once this engagement process is completed.   It is important to note that our intention in exploring this option is not to displace existing resources within the Department and the LES but to contract with other parties so as to complement and work alongside these resources and thereby increase our capacity to serve unemployed people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Offices","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[32894\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the provision of a social welfare office in Balbriggan, County Dublin, for local community welfare services in view of the fact that currently recipients are required to travel to the city centre; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, with effect from 1 July 2013, community welfare services (CWS) for the Balbriggan area, which were previously administered from Gardiner Street, Dublin 1, have transferred to Balbriggan Social Welfare Local Office, Mill Street, Balbriggan.

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  <\/p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. <\/p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.  <\/p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  For example in cases of schemes which include medical criteria such as disability allowance or invalidity pension, the time taken by the Department may include a review by a different medical assessor to the one who initially examined the case, and there may even be a third review by a medical assessor where additional medical evidence is submitted.  A considerable period of time is also added when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  However, if  an appellant&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet their needs, it is open to them to contact their local Community Welfare Services concerning their eligibility for Supplementary Welfare Allowance while their appeal is pending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Statistics","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[33247\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a 60% unemployment rate in Cherry Orchard, Dublin; and her plans to address the needs of areas with high levels of unemployment.","asker":"1047","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>The definition of unemployment used in the above-mentioned survey is self-defined unemployment as opposed to the stricter definition used by the ILO.  This can mean that people who are not working but who are also unavailable for work such as students and carers may be classified as unemployed in such a survey.  The methods used in the survey can also be questioned (e.g. door-to-door surveys can capture less employed people as they are more likely to be out at work). While recent Live Register figures show that there has been a 4.8% decrease in the numbers signing on in Ballyfermot in the past twelve months (and a fall of 11.3% in the number of young people signing on), the Government recognises that unemployment black spots exist in specific areas across the country and need to be addressed.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment.  Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance.  Increasingly, referral is now based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an even earlier stage.  By definition, such an approach focuses resources on those areas where unemployment is highest and of longest duration.  The roll-out of the profiling system at my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices will further enhance this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location.  In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s\/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.<\/p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp;amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region.  Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places.  The 5,000 places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas.  The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.  <\/p><p>  Other than through administrative mechanisms like those described, it is difficult to identify and target specific unemployment black spots at a very local level.  The most frequent unemployment data come from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS); as a sample survey, the QNHS provides reliable data at a regional, but not at a local level.  Small-area statistics are collected in the Census, but these are available only at five-year intervals, and the unemployment concept underlying them does not correspond exactly with that used in the QNHS.  <\/p><p>  However, the Government&rsquo;s policy of targeting resources at those most at risk of long-term unemployment overcomes this statistical deficit and ensures those areas that are most in need of assistance are prioritised.  The Department works primarily at a local level and is acutely aware of the differentiated impact of unemployment across local areas.  The Department has 59 Intreo\/local offices, 63 branch offices and newly incorporated employment offices.  The Live Register figures by office are closely monitored and are an important consideration for the provision of our activation services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[32900\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an invalidity pension application in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 13 which had gone to appeal and which has been granted under special provision by her Department, only to be immediately subjected to a medical review; if her attention has been drawn to the concerns and worry that this is causing the applicant who has been awaiting their claim for nearly two years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1181","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity.

The term 'habitually resident' conveys a degree of permanence and implies a close association between the applicant and the country from which payment is claimed, which relies heavily on fact.  The habitual residence guidelines were comprehensively revised in 2011 to take account of developments in case-law, both national and international, and to reflect the Department's interpretation of the legal provisions that impact on the habitual residence condition (HRC). <\/p><p>  The guidelines are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in the conditions and processes as they occur, for example, the removal of the work permit condition for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals and very recently the accession of Croatia to the EU.   The guidelines are published and available to customers on the Department's website to reflect the most up to date requirements.<\/p><p>  In addition to the HRC guidelines there is further information for customers including:<\/p><p> - HRC information leaflet SW108 available on the website<\/p><p> - A HRC supplement with example cases published on the website.<\/p><p>  Internally within DSP the Decisions Advisory Office unit provides guidance and support in complex cases and the staff development unit of DSP provides on-going HRC training.<\/p><p>  There is comprehensive information on the HRC guidelines relating to material to be provided by returning Irish emigrants.  Before a decision can be made regarding a person's habitual residence, it must be established whether the person has a legal right to reside in the State and all Irish nationals have a right of residence in Ireland.  At that stage the five factors are examined to determine whether a person satisfies the HRC i.e. a) the length and continuity of living in Ireland, b) length and reasons for any absence, c) nature and pattern of the person's employment, d) person's main centre of interest and e) future intentions of the person applying for the social welfare scheme.<\/p><p>  Each case is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on the application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular circumstances of the case.  Examples of documentation required is outlined on the HRC guideline, on the HRC information leaflet and on the Citizens Information website, including:<\/p><p>-   Proof to show applicant has given up accommodation abroad <\/p><p>-   Proof applicant has cancelled or applied to cancel any non-transferable benefits <\/p><p>-   Proof to show measures put in place to open a bank account here <\/p><p>-   Proof to show applicant has a tenancy in Ireland <\/p><p>-   Proof of travel documents and evidence of transportation of personal possessions etc. <\/p><p>  Any information that customers provide to establish their claim will be considered and it may be necessary in some cases to submit further documentary evidence in support of a claim.  The average time frame for the verification of habitual residency for applicants for social welfare is not captured as the HRC is examined as part of the overall claim process.  It is important to point out that if claimants are not satisfied with a decision they have the right to have the decision reviewed internally in DSP and\/or appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Training","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[33245\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the courses that staff in her Department have had funded for them; the cost of each of those courses through the learning and development strategy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so that people can continue living at home as long as possible.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant; and &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.

The EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, which is carried out by the Central Statistics Office each year, does however, measure the percentage of the population that said they were unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, over the previous year.  The most recent figures available from this survey indicate that in 2011, some 6.8% of households in Ireland were unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, the same level as in 2010 but an increase on the 2009 figure which was 4.1%. The Government has an energy poverty strategy; &lsquo;Warmer Homes &ndash; A Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland&rsquo; which was published by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources towards the end of 2011.  The Strategy identified the extent and impact of energy poverty, the existing measures in place and the actions required looking forward.  My Department has been working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders on the implementation of this Strategy.  Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home.  In 2013, my Department will spend an estimated &euro;284 million on the household benefits scheme, providing some 410,000 customers with a package worth almost &euro;700 per year.  In addition, some 410,000 customers will receive the fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week paid for 26 weeks, at a cost of &euro;211 million.<\/p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources; this may include exceptional heating costs.  In addition, more than 3,000 customers are currently in receipt of a special heating supplement, paid to assist people with special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity.  The provision for exceptional needs payments in 2013 is &euro;47.6 million, with an additional &euro;11.4 million for supplements.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to improve the thermal efficiency of the home.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme (BEWH), administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900059#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance Eligibility","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900060#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[33244\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900060#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans for back to education allowance in 2014; her plans to ensure back to education allowance will cover postgraduate courses in the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

A such, data from the 1926 Census will be made available in 2026.

While none of these are any longer truly nomadic, they suffer from the difficulties common to non-settled communities in many developed countries, including in Europe, and other Bedouin living in many Arab countries in the region. These include lack of title to traditionally used lands and resources, pressure from a growing settled community, traditional distrust and disengagement from external official authority, difficulty in operating within a legal system developed for settled communities, lack of understanding and intermittent attention from public authorities, and lack of political weight in decisions which affect them.  These are issues in many countries, not just Israel. It is an exageration to describe these as a policy of ethnic cleansing.<\/p><p>  We have discussed more general issues relating to Arab citizens of Israel here in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks. In relation to the Bedouin specifically, the most difficult problems relate to some 60,000 who live in as yet unrecognised villages, mostly in the area of and in some cased clustered around the rapidly growing city of Beersheva, one of Israel&rsquo;s major cities and the principal centre for the southern half of the country. <\/p><p>  While there are genuine planning and development needs in the vicinity of Beersheva, we clearly would expect that these must be addressed as much as possible through consultation, compromise and agreement, using the same standards applied for Israeli citizens generally. There have been a number of official inquiries and plans in recent years to address these issues, usually involving the recognition of some further Bedouin villages, and consolidation of existing unrecognised villages into these. <\/p><p>  The implementation of these plans has sometimes been piecemeal and non-transparent, and it remains the case that a number of villages have seen repeated demolitions of homes and schools, in a way that I do not think would be considered acceptable in relation to the majority community in Israel. Indeed I cannot help contrasting this with the extreme reluctance of the Israeli Government to act against illegal Israeli settlements even where these have been ordered to be removed by Israeli courts.  Both the EU and Ireland nationally have already raised these concerns with the Israeli authorities, and it will continue to feature in our dialogue about human rights issues in Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900061#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900061#WRD02350"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[33008\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900061#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will confirm the destination, purpose and cargo of three US military airplanes (details supplied) which landed at Shannon on 30 June 2013.","asker":"1015","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>On 25 June 2013, my Department received requests from the Embassy of the United States seeking permission for two Hercules C-130 aircraft with tail numbers 644852 and 650986 to land at Shannon Airport on 30 June for the purposes of crew rest and refuelling.

We continue to work through our Embassy to Myanmar\/Burma (based in Hanoi) and through the mechanisms of the EU and UN to ensure that human rights are respected in Myanmar\/Burma, including those of the Rohingya people.<\/p><p>  As the Deputies are aware, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has condemned local orders that have placed marriage and family size restrictions on the Rohingya community.  She has been joined in her condemnation by the Special Rapporteur for the Human Rights Situation in Myanmar\/Burma, Tomas Ojea Quintana, who has called these measures a clear-cut human rights violation.  I support them in urging the Government of Myanmar\/Burma to review and revoke all orders which violate international human rights standards.<\/p><p>  Myanmar\/Burma is currently undergoing a political, economic and social transition in which positive steps are being taken to transform the country and establish the country as a respected member of the international community.  However, together with our international partners, Ireland recognises that complex challenges remain, particularly in regards to the Rohingya minority and other ethnic groups.In January 2013, the Irish Ambassador in Hanoi presented his credentials to become the first Ambassador of Ireland accredited to Myanmar\/Burma.  Following accreditation, the Ambassador met with both the President and Foreign Minister of Myanmar\/Burma and discussed a range of issues, including the human rights situation in Rakhine State.<\/p><p>  In March 2013, during a visit to Brussels by the President of Myanmar\/Burma U Thein Sein, the EU and Myanmar\/Burma agreed, among other things, to work in partnership to promote human rights and the rule of law for all people living in Myanmar\/Burma, including the Rohingya community.  At the 23rd session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in May\/June of this year, Ireland and our fellow council members adopted a Presidential Statement regarding the Situation of Human Rights for Muslims in Myanmar\/Burma.  HRC members, expressed deep concern at the gross violations of human rights against Muslims in Myanmar\/Burma, including the Rohingya community, and urged the government there to grant full citizenship rights, to the Rohingya in Rakhine and review the 1982 Citizenship Law.<\/p><p>  In regards to trade restrictions, on 22  April 2013 Ireland together with our EU partners decided to lift all restrictive measures on Myanmar\/Burma, with the exception of the arms embargo and the embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression.  This decision was taken in light of the political and economic reforms that have been taking place in Myanmar\/Burma since 2011.  Also, in June 2013 during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, the reinstatement of Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for Myanmar\/Burma was secured, and will help promote economic development in the country.  Any move to re-impose sanctions would in my view be counterproductive.<\/p><p>  Finally, officials from my Department have just returned from a scoping mission to Myanmar\/Burma.  They held meetings with a wide range of government, opposition, business and civil society figures, with a view to making recommendations on how Ireland can assist with the humanitarian situation, promote economic development, and increase linkages with Ireland.  I expect to receive recommendations in this regard shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900061#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Presidency Expenditure","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900062#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[33031\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900062#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the cost of the advertisements placed in a publication (details supplied) on 2 July after the end of the Irish Presidency and the total cost of advertisements placed in media, broadcast, print and online, that were printed\/broadcast\/published after 30 June, the date of the end of the Presidency.

SEPA is an EU initiative that will change the way that these payments are processed across Europe. SEPA will allow payment systems users to make euro-denominated retail electronic payments to payees located in any of the participating countries, using a single payment account and a single set of payment instruments (the participating countries are the EU member states, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco).  SEPA comes into full effect on 1 February 2014 and businesses will need to ensure that payroll, direct debit and accounting systems are SEPA-ready. SEPA will introduce new business rules in relation to retail electronic payments and implement common standards in all participating countries for issuing and executing the underlying payment instructions. SEPA will deliver tangible benefits to businesses, for example by allowing faster settlement and simplified processing will improve cash flow and reduce costs.<\/p><p>  The implementation of SEPA within Ireland is overseen by the National Payments Plan (NPP) Steering Committee, which was established in 2012 to modernise the way payments are made in Ireland. In this regard, an NPP-SEPA sub-group has been formed, consisting of representatives of consumers, businesses, Government and banks. This sub group provides an avenue for the discussion of any issues that arise in the process of migrating to SEPA.<\/p><p>  The SEPA Direct Debit Scheme exists in two forms &ndash; the &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme and the &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; (Business to Business) scheme. Both scheme forms allow creditors to collect funds directly from a debtor&rsquo;s bank account, provided that a valid mandate has been given by the debtor to the creditor. The key difference is that in the B2B Scheme the payer is not entitled to obtain a refund in respect of an authorised transaction (in contrast with the rights afforded to the payer in the in the core SDD scheme).  Adherence to the core scheme by banks is mandatory, but provision of the B2B scheme is optional; thus far only two Irish banks are in a position to offer the SDD &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; service. The remaining banks are currently focussed on the migration of their business customers to the SEPA &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme in advance of the 1 February 2014 end-date. Once this objective has been achieved, the possibility of offering the &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; scheme will be examined by these banks; this issue is currently the subject of ongoing discussion between the banks concerned and the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to members of the Board of the Central Bank is set out in the schedule

The Irish taxpayer has grimly endured the austere cost of the bank recapitalisation and the bank guarantee. They are understandably outraged by these revelations. Irish citizens have suffered greatly as a direct result of the banking crisis and the events which have led to the bank guarantee.  The recent revelations will only serve to reinforce the Government&rsquo;s resolve to move this country back in the right direction by tightening up regulation and enforcing it. <\/p><p>  The tapes raise serious issues and this Government is committed to ensuring that the public is fully informed about what happened in Irish Banks in the lead up to and during the financial crisis.

","asker":"1011","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for the charging of interest on overdue taxes at a daily rate of 0.0219 per cent per day, just under 8% per annum, the same as the rate chargeable in relation to other taxes under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  The legislation provides for the possibility of full or partial deferral in certain defined circumstances to qualified liable persons, and in such circumstances, the daily interest rate is 0.011 per cent, just under 4% per annum.  This is half the interest rate that applies to cases of non-compliance.  The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  <\/p><p>  Certain events such as the receipt of money by way of winnings, gifts, inheritances or capital sums of any kind will cause the tax deferred up to that point, including interest, to become immediately payable.  Deferred LPT and interest will have to be discharged on the sale\/transfer of the property.  However, a deferral may be allowed to continue where the property passes to another person by way of a gift or inheritance and the new liable person is also eligible for a deferral.  Deferrals are voluntary and the tax payer may choose to pay any deferred LPT though not required to do so.<\/p><p>  Therefore, the length of time that LPT may be deferred and any amounts deferred will vary depending on individual circumstances.  These are some of the factors which make direct comparisons between the rates of interest charged on deferred LPT and bank loans difficult.<\/p><p>  Per Central Bank figures (Retail Interest Rate Statistics: April 2013), the weighted average interest rate on outstanding loans to households for consumption and other purposes stands at 6.19 per cent at end-April 2013. The interest rate on short-term loans for consumption and other purposes with an agreed maturity up to one year stood at 9.74 per cent at end-April 2013.  The corresponding short-term rate reported by all credit institutions in the euro area was lower at 7.73 per cent at end-April 2013.  Short-term loans for consumption and other purposes with an agreed maturity of up to one year include both overdrafts and credit card debt. In terms of longer-term loans, the interest rate reported by Irish resident credit institutions on loans with an original maturity over five years was 3.95 per cent at end-April 2013.  This rate fluctuates with the reported rate at 4.17 per cent as of April 2012.  In the euro area, the equivalent long-term interest rate reported by all credit institutions stood at 4.88 per cent at end-April 2013.<\/p><p>  While a variable rate linked to Central Bank interest rates was considered, a fixed rate was favoured on grounds of certainty to taxpayers over how much they may owe and ease of administration for the Revenue Commissioners in calculating any interest due.  I am satisfied that the rate of interest on deferred LPT is proportionate in the context of the higher rate of interest for cases of non-payment of LPT and current interest rates on loans from financial institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[32953\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in terms of deferral of property tax, if the same deferral conditions apply when the person involved is availing of the fair deal programme.","asker":"1011","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[32956\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in respect of the local property tax, the position regarding the deferral rule where a house is willed to someone who is unable to pay due to unemployment.

An exemption may also apply where the period is less than 12 months, if a doctor is satisfied that the person is unlikely at any stage to return to the property.  In both cases, the exemption applies only where the property is not occupied by any other person or is not jointly owned with another person.  <\/p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a liability for Local Property Tax (LPT) will arise where a person is a liable person in relation to a residential property on the liability date, which was 1 May 2013 for the year 2013.

For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band from &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and 18 bands between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1,000,000 with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  As property owners were not required to provide a precise value for their property as at 1 May 2013, it is anticipated that for the most part overpayments of LPT should not happen.   That initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes during this period.  This will ensure a measure of certainty for all property owners.  Accordingly, where an owner assessed that the value of a residential property on 1 May 2013 places it in a particular valuation band but, due to a general decrease in property prices after that date, the reduction in the value of the property would place it in a lower valuation band, the owner will not be entitled to a refund of tax.  By the same token, if the property increases in value in that period, no additional charges will apply. The owner will, however, have the opportunity to re-assess the value of the property on the next valuation date, which is 1 November 2016.<\/p><p>  Revenue is most concerned that people meet their obligations voluntarily and pay the correct amount of tax.  However, if someone has genuinely overpaid their LPT, Section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides that a claim for a refund of the tax overpaid may be made to Revenue, where the overpayment of LPT was made due to an error or mistake on a return or a statement made by the liable person, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.  In this regard, I am advised that Revenue will issue detailed guidelines later in the year setting out the procedures to be followed by those who consider that they have either over or under valued their property for LPT purposes or inadvertently paid on foot of the Revenue estimate.  However, in the meantime, if a person has such concerns regarding their property, they can write to LPT Branch, Government Buildings, Kilrush Road, Ennis, Co. Clare setting out their case and the matter will be considered.<\/p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that any valuation amendments to Local Property Tax Returns must be in writing and must be supported by the appropriate evidence to explain or prove the need to decrease the value.  Evidence can be in the form of recent sales or advertised house prices in the area, professional valuations or house price surveys for the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":258,"content":"<p>Question No. 152 answered with Question No. 150.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF01350"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[33006\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in what capacity was a person (details supplied) a member of the board of the Central Bank of Ireland; and if he was representing himself or the trade union movement.

All of these staff have been recruited on the basis of specified purpose contracts.<\/p><p>  The issue of a transfer of staff from IBRC to NAMA does not arise. Prior to the appointment of the Special Liquidators to IBRC on 7 February 2013, IBRC provided primary servicing (loan administration services) on NAMA loans with nominal balances of &euro;41 billion and provided special servicing (debtor engagement) on &euro;5.1 billion of this portfolio. These services are now being moved to Capita Asset Services which was appointed by NAMA in March as back-up servicer to the existing IBRC portfolio. Capita is currently recruiting staff, both within IBRC and elsewhere. As part of the new arrangements, NAMA has decided to assume certain oversight functions in relation to this portfolio and, arising from this, positions have been advertised and applications have been received from IBRC staff.  I am advised that this process is still ongoing and that of 27 offers made to IBRC staff to date 10 have been accepted and 17 have been declined.  <\/p><p>  In addition, as part of the Government&rsquo;s decision in February to appoint the Special Liquidators, it was decided that NAMA would acquire any loans which were unsold after the Special Liquidators had completed a loan valuation and sales process.  The loan valuation process is currently underway and I am advised that additional positions are likely to become available in NAMA and in its service providers after the loan sales process has concluded and NAMA has acquired any unsold loans.  <\/p><p>  It is a matter for the NTMA, as employer, to satisfy itself as to the suitability of the staff it recruits, including staff assigned to NAMA.  Section 42 of the NAMA Act requires the NTMA to ascertain to its satisfaction that the staff it proposes to assign to NAMA are of good character and have not been convicted of any offence likely to render them unfit or unsuitable, have not been disqualified or restricted from acting as a director under the Companies Acts and have no material conflicts of interest, whether actual or potential.  In addition, under section 42(3), a member of staff of the NTMA is required to provide a statement of his or her interests, assets and liabilities before being assigned to NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[33037\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation staff who have been made redundant or have been notified that they will be made redundant since the liquidation of the company was announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 162 together.<\/p><p>  An unsustainable debt position has been reached by many borrowers, which needs to be addressed for the benefit of both borrowers and lenders alike.  The Central Bank is facilitating a voluntary co-ordinated approach among lenders to the resolution of multiple debts owed by distressed borrowers.  <\/p><p>  The Central Bank is now carrying out a pilot exercise, involving banks, credit unions and other lenders, to test an approach to dealing with both secured and unsecured debt in a sample of approximately 750 cases where borrowers have debts with multiple lenders.  This pilot framework contains a restructuring waterfall that will be applied to each borrower that agrees to participate, in order to establish the most appropriate modification to put him or her on an affordable repayment path.  The pilot will operate for a period of three months, after which the results will be assessed to establish the effectiveness of the framework and to determine the appropriate next steps.  It should be emphasised that participation in the pilot is voluntary for both the lender and borrower.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank pilot scheme will offer the opportunity for distressed borrowers - including credit union members - to resolve their debts without the need to enter into a formal statutory process.  In this respect, it is important that credit union members are not left with a more limited range of options than are available to customers of other financial institutions.  It is in this spirit that the Central Bank has written to all credit unions to make them aware of the pilot so that the credit unions can decide whether their participation is in the interests of their members, including members with distressed debts across multiple lenders.  <\/p><p>  Credit unions have been invited by the Central Bank to nationwide information seminars on the pilot scheme to discuss its objectives and approach.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has also been invited to attend at these sessions and provide input into the content of them.  <\/p><p>  The Central Bank initiatives in the mortgage arrears area, including the pilot framework and the mortgage arrears targets initiative announced last March, is consistent with the overall Government approach to the mortgage arrears problem.  In particular, the Government, while significantly modernising Ireland&rsquo;s bankruptcy and insolvency law and procedures, has also advocated and encouraged borrowers and lenders to address situations of debt difficulty, where possible, on a bilateral and informal basis, and the recent Central Bank initiatives should underpin that process.  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable lenders to work with distressed borrowers to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.<\/p><p>  The correspondence referred to in the Question also raises an issue regarding the repayment of direct debits. I can clarify in terms of the refund rights available to payers under SEPA, these are laid down in the Payment Services Directive 2009 (the PSD) as transposed by S.I. 383 of 2009, and in the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) scheme rulebook published by the European Payments Council (the owner of the SDD scheme). <\/p><p>  The PSD grants consumers refund rights in three situations - for overcharging, unauthorised debits and incorrect processing. For unauthorised debits and incorrect processing, the payer has a right to an immediate refund as long as they notify their bank as soon as possible, and no later than 13 months after the debit date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF03250"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[33092\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900063#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the options for a homeowner (details supplied) in County Wexford having discovered errors after making their local property tax return; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":288,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that any valuation amendments to Local Property Tax Returns must be in writing and must be supported by the appropriate evidence to explain or prove the need to decrease the value.

IBRC, the merged entity, comprising both Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank, remained solvent and in compliance with capital requirements up until liquidation on the 7th February 2013.  Anglo Irish Bank was regarded as a systemically important credit institution and was managed and dealt with on that basis by all the Irish regulatory authorities.  Failure of such an important institution would have had serious and immediate financial an economic implications.  Having consulted with the Central Bank capital was provided to the bank to ensure that they continued to meet all regulatory capital requirements.<\/p><p>  In the case of Anglo the Department knew, prior to nationalisation, that capital would be required, that funding at the bank was problematic and that certain risks, including governance issues, could, if not mitigated, materially impact on the bank.  However, the bank was not adjudged insolvent at that time.  The audited accounts for the period, and assessments by the Financial Regulator, PriceWaterHouse Coopers (PWC) and Merrill Lynch all indicated that the bank was solvent.  Anglo was nationalised because of governance issues, and funding problems in particular which would very quickly have placed the bank in a position of inability to repay maturing debt including deposits, with a major and immediate knock-on impact on other banks and on the State.  Further, there was strong negative market sentiment towards the bank which was impacting on the banking sector generally.<\/p><p>  With the benefit of hindsight, however, it is now clear that the full extent of the evolving  problems in global financial crisis or the property market  were not envisaged in any assessment of the bank at that time.

This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and inland to intercept and seize illegal products and to prosecute those involved.  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally.

The revised CCMA came into effect from 1 July 2013 and can be accessed on the Central Bank's website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.centralbank.ie<\/font><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900064#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900064#WRG01950"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[33408\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900064#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if persons who provided a single direct authority payment instruction for the local property tax for 2013 automatically have the payment deducted from their nominated account on 21 March 2014 or will they be required to sign a new single debit authority as persons were informed that this is like an electronic cheque and therefore by definition a single payment and they were told it would be deducted not earlier than 21 July 2013; there is no reference that a different amount will automatically be deducted from their account in March 2014 without them having to sign a new payment authority, as would be the case like a new cheque which they were given to understand was the equivalent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>Officials of my Department continue to monitor developments regarding the imposition of an SMS\/MMS\/mobile call levy in Hungary.  I am advised that, since 1 July 2012, publicly available telephone services in Hungary are subject to a tax which is levied on telecommunications service providers and which applies on the initiation of phone calls and the sending of SMS and MMS messages.  The tax is levied at the rate of 2 Hungarian Forint (HUF) per minute for initiated phone calls and HUF 2 per message (SMS\/MMS) sent, which converts to approximately EUR0.0068, or c. two-thirds of 1 cent.  Calls and messages to emergency services and those making charitable donations are exempt from the levy, as well as the first 10 minutes of calling in each month.  The amount of tax payable is capped at HUF 700 (EUR &euro;2.37) per month per phone number for private individuals and HUF 2,500 (EUR&euro;8.47) for non-private individuals.<\/p><p>  The levy is set to increase in Hungary from August 1.  It is proposed that the telecom tax paid by businesses only will rise by HUF1 per minute or per text message, and the upper limit payable will rise from HUF2,500 to HUF5,000 (EUR &euro;17 approximately).  As previously advised, I understand the levy is the subject of European Commission challenge, claiming an infringement of Directive 2002\/20\/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive).  The action is currently at notification stage and has been responded to by the Hungarian authorities.  No information has been made available as yet to my officials regarding behavioural impact of the tax.<\/p><p>  As previously advised, the wider social and economic considerations which may militate against the introduction of a further tax on text messages would have to be taken into account, including the fact that that mobile phone calls and text messages are already subject to VAT at 23%, that a levy on such calls and messages could significantly increase the overall rate of taxation on mobile phone accounts, which would have implications for all sectors of society, and, finally, the fact the Exchequer has already received substantial benefit from the industry, particularly in the context of the recent spectrum auction.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I am advised by ComReg that the winning bidders of its Multi-band Spectrum Auction for the 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands will pay &euro;854.64 million for these spectrum rights, comprising firstly of Upfront Fees amounting to &euro;481.7 million (adjusted as necessary by transitional arrangements) and secondly, Annual Spectrum Usage Fees in the amount of &euro;372.95 million which will be adjusted for inflation and paid in instalments until July 2030.

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005\/60\/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006\/70\/EC) into Irish Law.  Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship.

In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.<\/p><p>  In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900064#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":329,"content":"<p>Question No. 178 answered with Question No. 146.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900065#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[33453\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900065#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on allowing, in Budget 2014, persons access up to 30% of their pension scheme akin to the AVC measure adopted in Budget 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Pupils with Down Syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. <\/p><p>  I wish to explain to the Deputies also that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down Syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. <\/p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.<\/p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. <\/p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900067#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900067#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[33287\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900067#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will reverse the decision to reduce the permanent teaching staff at a school (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":436,"content":"<p>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on the Department's website.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. <\/p><p>  I wish to clarify that there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs. The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  Therefore, even if the number of students receiving SNA support rises, this does not necessarily mean that the required number of SNAs to support their care needs should rise by a similar percentage. <\/p><p>  In June 2012 the NCSE reported that the number of children requiring support for the 2012\/2013 school year was in the order of 20,000 and the most up-to-date current figures is that for December 2012 of 21,972.  The initial allocation of SNAs for the coming school year will support about 22,000 pupils. This is at about the same level supported in December 2012, despite the passing of 6 months.

In drawing up the HRA, the Labour Relations Commission expressly recognised that Government plans for certain public service pension reductions did not form part of the proposals which comprise the HRA. The relevant paragraph in the HRA, headed &ldquo;Public Service Pensions&rdquo;, reads as follows: &ldquo;Separately to this Agreement, the Parties note that the Government intends to align the reductions in public service pensions in payment with the reductions applied to serving staff. The Parties note that this measure will apply to pensions in payment greater than &euro;32,500 only.&rdquo;<\/p><p>  Reductions in those public service pensions valued in excess of &euro;32,500 duly took effect on 1 July 2013, on foot of provisions in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and accomplished by recourse to the &ldquo;Public Service Pension Reduction&rdquo; (PSPR), which was originally introduced in 2011.  It is important to emphasize that these July 2013 pension reductions only apply to higher-value public service pensions.

For example, out of the 12,850 planned workplace inspections and investigations for 2013, 3,000 will be carried out in the high risk agriculture sector.  <\/p><p>  To emphasise the importance of workplace health and safety in the agriculture sector, in April this year, the Authority carried out a two-week farm safety campaign with a focus on joint involvement with farmer representative organisations.  The campaign included actions such as farm walks and talks, with a particular emphasis on farmers in the 60+ age group.  This age-group received particular attention as over half the 182 people killed over the last decade in agriculture were in this age-group.  In an effort to focus attention on age as a risk factor, the Authority and the IFA have jointly produced a DVD entitled 'Older, Wiser, Safer - A Practical Guide to Safety for Older Farmers.' <\/p><p>  Partnership remains central to the Authority's approach to improving farm safety.  This approach involves the major stakeholders in the agriculture sector in the task of improving farm safety through the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee - a sub-committee of the Board of the Authority.  This approach is designed to better support the identification and development of broad based actions by the primary stakeholders to assist in developing and sustaining a safety and health culture within the sector.  It seeks to emulate the approach that has worked well in the construction sector.<\/p><p>  An important element of achieving improved farm safety outcomes will be the soon-to-be-published three-year (2013-15) Action Plan for the Farm Safety Partnership.  This plan will aim to deliver coordinated initiatives on awareness raising, safety promotion, research and special projects. The Plan's key goals are: <\/p><p>  - To establish and implement appropriate Safety and Health Training and Educational programmes for farmers and persons who are employed in the agriculture sector.<\/p><p>  - To develop programmes to prevent accidents and injuries to vulnerable persons (children and older persons) in agriculture.<\/p><p>  - To achieve cultural and behavioural changes related to risk taking in agriculture.<\/p><p>  - To influence farmers to manage high risk work activities and to improve standards in the use and maintenance of Tractors, Machinery and Farm Vehicles.<\/p><p>  - To implement programmes to assist in protecting the occupational health of persons working in agriculture. <\/p><p>  The Farm Safety Committee's previous 2009-2012 Action Plan set ambitious targets in health and safety and identified specific activities to achieve these targets and much was achieved during the course of this plan. In response to the serious challenges faced in agriculture, the Authority responded comprehensively with a number of initiatives including: <\/p><p>  - On-line farm risk assessment tool   .<\/p><p>  - A Code of Practice for Agriculture which includes a Risk Assessment Document and a Safe System of Work  Plan (SWWP). The Code provides practical user-friendly guidance with respect to farmers, family members,  employees, service providers, advisers, trainers and persons with a role related to safety and health. It sets out  clearly the major risks in farming and provides a simple approach through the risk assessment document to  managing safety at farm level.<\/p><p>  - An extensive media campaign on national TV, national &amp;amp; local radio and in the print media.<\/p><p>  In 2012 the Authority pursued an integrated farm safety media campaign, which included graphic TV advertisements, and hard-hitting radio and print ads, all with a strong focus on the shocking consequences of farm accidents for real farmers.  The aim of this element of the Authority's campaign was to drive home the terrible consequences that result from accidents in the agriculture sector.<\/p><p>  The Authority has 20 Inspectors who carry out proactive inspection work in the agriculture sector including 5 full time specialists in the Agriculture Inspection Group.   The level of awareness among farmers in relation to their duty to ensure a safe farm - based on inspection - is now estimated at 80%.  It continues to be the experience of the Health and Safety Authority Inspectors that while the standard of the individual Safety Statement\/Code of Practice is, in general, adequate to control the risks on the farm, the implementation of the identified controls and allocation of resources required is lower. <\/p><p>  The Authority has, this week, commenced a 'Farm Safety Survey' of 3,000 randomly selected, farm households. The overall aim of the proposed research is to identify the factors most likely to influence farmers in Ireland to make long-term behavioural changes with regard to their daily farm work, to improve knowledge of methods of farm accident prevention, to inform future Authority preventive activity and to make recommendations concerning how best to make farms safer places to work and live. <\/p><p>  Ultimately, day-to-day responsibility for workplace safety rests with those in the workplace in the first instance.  In that context, it is important that we all maintain a strong focus on workplace safety as safe workplaces can ultimately only be delivered by those who control and work in them.  Agriculture, by its very nature, is one of the more hazardous occupations, especially as the workplace and family home are so often one-and-the-same.  In such circumstances, I would urge all involved in the agriculture sector to re-double their efforts to improve health and safety standards in their sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900070#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900070#WRN00350"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[32867\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900070#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will outline the current efforts being made by his Department and other institutions to promote Longford as a region for enterprise; If he will provide some information regarding the resources and benefits Longford has to offer to potential investors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p><b><\/b>IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Longford County Enterprise Board are all working to promote enterprise development in County Longford.

The Directive also seeks to facilitate multi-territorial licensing by collecting societies of authors' rights in musical works when transmitted online.<\/p><p>  In terms of governance, the Directive proposes to set down rules in relation to the conduct of CMO&rsquo;s in terms of structured management arrangements such as the need to provide for a general assembly of members with certain areas of responsibility and decision making ability, the establishment of fair criteria for membership eligibility, the imposition of obligations and duties on persons who manage the business of the CMO, the need to provide for a supervisory function in CMO&rsquo;s etc.  Requirements are also set out in relation to the timeframe for distribution to Right holders of revenue received from the use of copyrights or related rights, the deductions that can be made therefrom and, the investment and distribution of such monies.  Rules on disclosure of information to Right holders, members and the general public together with the need for the preparation of annual transparency reports are also proposed. <\/p><p>  My Department carried out an initial general consultation on the directive at the time of publication and, submissions were received from a number of Irish CMO&rsquo;s.

While it is far too early to anticipate the eventual negotiated outcome<b><\/b>of the Agreement, the scope of the Council's negotiating directives to the EU Commission<b><\/b>is sufficiently<b><\/b>wide to maximise the potential benefits of an Agreement for the EU and its Member States.<\/p><p>  Studies by the EU Commission and other European bodies indicate that a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU. Given the current very low level of economic growth in the EU and in Ireland, this will be a significant injection of economic activity and consequently of new job opportunities. Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy within the EU, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800million per annum in increased GDP, and 4,000 new jobs.<\/p><p>  As formal negotiations have yet to begin, it is not possible to estimate in detail the impact on Ireland until there is greater clarity about any exchange of offers, the scale of the possible long term gains will have a positive impact on Ireland given our close trading and investment relationship with the U.S. In addition, many Irish exporters are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe's exports to the U.S.  While tariffs are already low on trade across the Atlantic, the objective of abolishing even these will bring benefits to business in the short term. Tariffs that average about 3% on EU\/U.S. trade may appear insignificant but even at this low level they constitute an unnecessary tax on trade with the U.S. by both foreign and indigenous companies.   <\/p><p>  The major benefits of course will arise from reform of regulatory restrictions applied by both economies. Many of these, such as the cost of having to meet two sets of technical specifications for consumer and other products, add extensive costs to exporters. In the longer term, if the TTIP brings about a regime whereby exporters would only need to meet one set of product compliance rules, it would save significant costs for exporters of medical devices, pharmaceuticals and chemicals among others. Ireland's agribusiness sector would benefit if rules are changed that currently hold back our food exporters from being able to freely sell into the U.S. market, in the same way as they can into the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900070#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Surveys","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900070#WRN02450"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[33313\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900070#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the recent ranking of Ireland in the top ten ranking on the Global Innovation Index 2013, a survey by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and Cornell University; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":608,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s recent ranking of 10th in the Global Innovation Index 2013 is encouraging and a positive affirmation of our capabilities in this area.

Recognising the urgency required in tackling the challenge of youth joblessness, the EPSCO Council quickly agreed on the EU Council Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee in February.  The Irish Presidency was at the forefront of securing agreement on the adoption of the Recommendation.  The Recommendation is that Member States should:<i>Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education<\/i>.<\/p><p>  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014 - 2020 EU Budget earlier this year, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the Youth Guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment. This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line.<\/p><p>  Proposals supported by the Irish Presidency that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose be used in 2014 and 2015 were approved last month. In addition, The European Council agreed last week that margins left available below the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) budgetary ceilings for the years 2014-2017 will be used to constitute a &quot;global margin for commitments&quot; to fund in particular measures to fight youth unemployment. The flexibility means, in effect, that beyond the &euro;6 billion that we reserved in February<b>, <\/b>there will be substantially more available for the Youth Employment Initiative - according to projections, at least &euro;8 billion in total.  <\/p><p>  It is recognised, both in the Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State. At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented.  For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013. The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  Recent trends have been positive in this regard. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate for young people is now just over 26%, down from an average of over 30% last year. The seasonally-adjusted number of young people on the Live Register, at 67,000, is substantially down from the peak of 89,000 reached in late 2009. Even so, the implementation of a Guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/p><p>  To summarise, significant political progress was made on the issue of youth unemployment during the Irish Presidency. It now remains for the recommendation on the Youth Guarantee to be implemented by individual Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900071#WRO02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":651,"content":"<p>Question No. 286 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900071#WRO02450"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[32920\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900071#WRO02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a carer's allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":654,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 26 June 2013 who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.

If they have exceeded 30 days, they will become eligible again provided they are still signing on and the cumulative total within the current 12-month qualifying period has dropped below 30 worked days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900071#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[32949\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position with regard to the national roll-out of Intreo offices; if she is satisfied with the progress the Office of Public Works is making on the programme; and if she will provide the general schedule for the roll-out covering 2013 and 2014.

The delivery of the Intreo service comprises a number of elements. The main elements being:<\/p><p>  i. The integration of the various welfare decision making processes to speed up decision making and minimise recourse to supplementary welfare payments.<\/p><p>  ii. The introduction of a profiling process to capture the unique characteristics and service requirements of each jobseeker.<\/p><p>  iii. The implementation of a systematic group activation engagement and one to one process based on clients&rsquo; profiles.<\/p><p>  iii. The delivery of a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; service from an integrated office location.<\/p><p>  Elements (i) to (iii) are being rolled out, are already in place in most offices and will be in place in all offices by the end of the year.<\/p><p>  The delivery of over 60 One-Stop-Shop Intreo Offices is a major logistical property project for the Department and the Office of Public Works which is responsible for the provision of the Department&rsquo;s property requirements, including refurbishment and fit out works.  The Intreo Project requires the acquisition and development of some new properties and the re-modelling and refurbishment of others. All of this also entails the re-accomodation of staff including the transfer and set-up of IT, furniture and other utilities across multiple locations.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the complexity of such a large property programme, twelve offices are now providing the full Intreo service.

The new website represents the first phase of a multiple programme of planned activity in the website and online services area of the Department. It incorporates the major expansion of the Department in recent times and it aligns the site with the Department&rsquo;s priorities, including the activation of jobseekers and information and services for employers. It will also facilitate the delivery of more online services for customers.<\/p><p>  The design of the new site includes improved navigation features for all users, as well as a dedicated Intreo area (www.intreo.ie), through which employers and jobseekers can access all existing information and services in relation to supports, training and entitlements. This includes links to existing content and services held on other sites such as JobBridge, F&Aacute;S and JobsIreland; providing jobseekers and employers with one central location for their information needs.<\/p><p>  The new website includes a number of new online services for jobseekers including an Office Locator which provides users with immediate access to contact details for their local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Office, as well as a Find a Job service, integrated with the Jobs Ireland website, which allows users search for jobs directly from the Department's website.  Other online services for jobseekers include online claiming and &ldquo;signing&rdquo; for Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments and a &ldquo;Close my claim&rdquo; service through which jobseekers can notify the Department when they get a job.  From July, jobseekers can also use the site to check their eligibility under the new JobsPlus incentive, which replaces the Revenue Job Assist and the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive schemes.<\/p><p>  Employers can access information on the range of recruitment services, financial supports and workplace supports available to them to help generate employment and retain employees.  They can also now register online for the JobsPlus incentive, which provides a grant to employers who employ jobseekers who have spent twelve months or more on the Live Register.<\/p><p>  Extensive information on all of the other schemes and services provided by my Department is carried on the website, as well as a range of online services, presented in a user-friendly format. These online services allow users to claim online for a number of payments, including Child Benefit and State Pension; request statements of payments they have received; request copies of their social insurance record; submit queries and comments, and also report suspected social welfare fraud.<\/p><p>  1,010,780 people visited the new website from February to June 2013.  As many people would visit the site more than once and look at more than one page per visit, this translates into over 1.78 million visits and almost 7 million page views.  After the home page, the most popular pages on the website are those related to jobseekers and online services.  The new online services developed as part of the website redesign project are proving popular with users; almost 104,000 people have used the new Office Locator and over 75,000 have used the Find a Job service.<\/p><p>  The new technical infrastructure delivered under this project gives the Department greater flexibility in the way in which it can provide information and services to its online customers and will also facilitate the development and delivery of enhanced online services.  In particular, the new infrastructure has delivered the online JobsPlus service for employers and jobseekers, launched earlier this week.<\/p><p>  Following an open procurement process, Hewlett Packard (HP) Ireland Ltd were appointed as consultants on the website redesign project. The overall cost of the new website, including VAT, is &euro;569,958.  This figure includes the development of the desktop version of the site, a mobile version of the site, the first year&rsquo;s maintenance fee and 21 days additional support in the event that specific development work is required to implement new online services.<\/p><p>  The previous version of the website, in existence from September 2008 to January 2013, cost &euro;485,451; this figure included the development of the desktop site (but not a mobile site), three year&rsquo;s maintenance fee and 30 days additional support.  A strategic review of the Department&rsquo;s then website was undertaken in 2007 at a cost of &euro;58,000 and recommended that a full redesign of the website be initiated. All the recommendations of this review were implemented in the 2008 website redesign project.<\/p><p>  Given the extended range of information and services provided through the new welfare.ie site, and the greater flexibility and opportunities afforded by the site&rsquo;s new technical infrastructure, I believe the new website will prove more cost-effective than its predecessor and that the Department&rsquo;s investment in this area was justified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payments","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP00650"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[32965\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the circumstances in which an exceptional needs payment may be made and the amount of flexibility which a community welfare officer or other responsible person has in this regard.","asker":"1011","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

Mr Hinz undertook a number of trips to Ireland to Chair the meetings at no travel cost to the Exchequer with the exception of one flight for a consultation forum in September 2012 at a cost &euro;1,445.78.  Accommodation costs for all meetings were paid for my department at a total cost of &euro;1,674.00. <\/p><p>  The work undertaken for all of the above reports would have been supported by officials of the Department of Social Protection as part of their wider day to day duties and indeed by a range of other Departments and organisations (e.g. the Pensions Board, Central Bank, Pensions Ombudsman) and wider sectoral interests.  In general meetings in relation to the various reports were held in Departmental accommodation or in the premises of the organisation undertaking the work and did not result in further costs arising.<\/p><p>  A significant Consultation Forum was held in Farmleigh September 2012 with a catering cost of &euro;1,980.97.  To maximise cost efficiency, this was a joint consultation forum for both the OECD review and the Critical Reviews of the Pensions Board and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and involved representatives from over 50 sectoral interests. <\/p><p>  Actions following Review &amp;amp; Report Recommendations in 2013<\/p><p>  (i) In relation to the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, the review covers a 55 year period from 2011-2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 actuarial reviews.  The findings in the Review inform both short to medium and long term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally.  Projections contained with the report indicate that in the absence of any action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the Fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.<\/p><p>  (ii) Regarding the OECD Review of Irish Pensions System (completed in April 2013), the review examines all aspects of pensions in Ireland covering both State pension, private, occupational and public sector pensions.  It is an extremely comprehensive report amounting to some 150 pages of analysis and commentary.  The report provides for consideration, key findings and a wide choice of suggested measures for reform which would involve a number of Government departments.   The report is now being examined in detail with a view to bringing proposals to Government setting out the roadmap for pension reform.<\/p><p>   (iii) The Public Service Reform Programme provided for a critical review of the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman. The recommendations of the review group were accepted by Government in April last.  The key recommendation from the critical review in relation to the Pensions Board is that an amalgamation of the regulatory function of the Pensions Board with the Central Bank is not recommended at this time, but that the governance structure of the Pensions Board should be restructured with two distinct arms; oversight of the Pensions Board will be undertaken by a three man body called the Pensions Authority, and a separate unpaid Pensions Council, with a majority of members representing consumer interests, will advise the Minister on pensions policy.  The relevant legislative measures to implement these changes have been provided for in the Social Welfare and Pension Bill, 2013.   The new structure is expected to be operational by year end. <\/p><p>  In relation to the Pensions Ombudsman, the key recommendation is to amalgamate the office with the Financial Services Ombudsman and arrangements will be put in place to provide for the implementation of this recommendation in the near future.<\/p><p>  (iv) The Report on Pension Charges 2012 was undertaken by my Department with the Central Bank and Pensions Board, and with support from PWC.  The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.  The launch of the Report on Pension Charges report was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders.  Following the consultation period, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced.  The first task I will be giving the new Pensions Council is to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise me if further actions are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":679,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":680,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[32981\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900072#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"considering the recent definitive victory by the Waterford Crystal workers against the Government in the European Court of Justice and the potential costs that will now accrue to the State, if she has reviewed the advice to contest the case in the manner the Government did; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":681,"content":"<p>On 25 April last, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling which contained a number of clarifications regarding transposition EU Directive 2008\/94EC which concerns the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.

In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Groups report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable was submitted to me in May 2013.  The report will be published in due course.<\/p><p>  Any proposal to change the treatment of self-employed persons in relation to the PRSI contributions to be paid and benefit entitlements could only be considered in a Budgetary context.<\/p><p>  Self-employed persons whose businesses fail or suffer from reduced demand may, however, access social welfare support by establishing entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900073#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":716,"content":"<p>Question Nos. 309 and 310 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900073#WRQ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[33182\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900073#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she has prepared for an increase in demand for services from her Department as a result of upcoming developments such as the Central Bank's updated CCMA, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill, the targets that have been set for the banks regarding sustainable solutions, or any other developments; the steps that have been taken to deal with any surge in demand; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This service provides comprehensive information and advice to mortgage holders in arrears or pre-arrears in assessing their options. The service has three elements:<\/p><p>- Website:  is the key online access portal for general mortgage arrears information and advice.<\/p><p>- Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline (phone 0761 074050): The Helpline provides general mortgage arrears information and signposting in relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears,  and other supports available for those in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. The Helpline operates Monday to Friday from 9am to 5 pm.<\/p><p>- Independent Financial Advice: The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland. To date, over 2,000 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are available on . The lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrowers choice for the provision of this advice.<\/p><p>  A protocol for the provision of independent financial advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the Irish Banking Federation. The protocol was agreed following discussions which were facilitated by the Department of Finance and involved the Department of Social Protection and the Central Bank. The protocol details the scope of financial advice and the operating procedures.<\/p><p>  When a lender is proposing long term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this advice, that the lender will pay the consultation fee.  The independent financial advice will be available to all mortgage holders in respect of a mortgage secured on a primary residence who are being offered long term forbearance options by their lenders. The borrower may select an accountant of their choice from a panel of practising accountants whose details are available on the website .<\/p><p>  In addition to these supports, the Department also administers a mortgage interest supplement scheme which provides short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments. There are currently some 12,000 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which almost &euro;42 million has been provided by the Government in 2013.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has recently introduced a revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which came into effect on 1 July 2013. Within this framework, mortgage interest supplement continues to provide suitable support with eligible persons having to engage with alternative payment options for a cumulative twelve month period under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) prior to the supplement being granted. This process acknowledges that it is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower to address financial difficulties as speedily and effectively as circumstances allow.<\/p><p>  Where a person has been assessed as having a housing need, the person concerned can apply for rent supplement administered by this Department which is available to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are currently approximately 84,000 customers in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for the scheme in 2013.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the Department has the appropriate services and supports in place to assist people experiencing financial difficulties.

They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<\/p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.<\/p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.

This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900073#WRQ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[33357\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900073#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Clare will receive a decision on an appeal in respect of an application for carer's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":816,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 345 together.<\/p><p>The number of cases referred to appeal in respect of each category of welfare payment from 2009 to 2013 (to date) are given in the table that follows this reply.  It is noted that the areas experiencing most referrals to appeal are those areas experiencing the highest volumes of claim applications.  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  To manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<\/p><p>In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is under way in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012, these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  For example, in cases of schemes which include medical criteria such as disability allowance or invalidity pension, the time taken by the Department may include a review by a different medical assessor to the one who initially examined the case, and there may even be a third review by a medical assessor if additional medical evidence is submitted.  A considerable period of time is added when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  However, if an appellant&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet their needs, it is open to them to contact their local Community Welfare Services concerning their eligibility for Supplementary Welfare Allowance while their appeal is pending.<\/p><p><b>Appeals Receipts 01\/01\/2013 &ndash; 30\/06\/2013<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>

The RBS was established to enable a basic broadband service to be provided to individual rural premises, which were not capable of obtaining a broadband service from existing Internet service providers.  119 applicants from County Monaghan received offers from service providers participating in this Scheme of which 25 accepted an offer of service.<\/p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.<\/p><p>In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have just commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.<\/p><p>The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Monaghan<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>ED Name ED Reference No.<\/div><\/th><th><div>ED Reference No.<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>AGHABOG <\/td><td><div>ED 177001<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ANNAYALLA <\/td><td><div>ED 177003<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BELLATRAIN <\/td><td><div>ED 177009<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BOCKS <\/td><td><div>ED 177010<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BROOMFIELD <\/td><td><div>ED 177012<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARRICKASLANE <\/td><td><div>ED 177014<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARRICKATEE <\/td><td><div>ED 177015<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CHURCH HILL <\/td><td><div>ED 177021<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORMEEN <\/td><td><div>ED 177026<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CREEVE <\/td><td><div>ED 177028<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CREMARTIN <\/td><td><div>ED 177029<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CROSSALARE <\/td><td><div>ED 177030<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CURRIN <\/td><td><div>ED 177031<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DERRYGORRY <\/td><td><div>ED 177033<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DRUM <\/td><td><div>ED 177035<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DRUMCARROW <\/td><td><div>ED 177037<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DRUMGURRA <\/td><td><div>ED 177038<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DRUMMULLY <\/td><td><div>ED 177040<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GLASLOUGH <\/td><td><div>ED 177046<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GREAGH <\/td><td><div>ED 177047<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILLEEVAN <\/td><td><div>ED 177049<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILLYNENAGH <\/td><td><div>ED 177051<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILMURRY <\/td><td><div>ED 177053<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LARAGH <\/td><td><div>ED 177055<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MULLYASH <\/td><td><div>ED 177060<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NEWBLISS <\/td><td><div>ED 177061<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SHANMULLAGH <\/td><td><div>ED 177065<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SHESKIN <\/td><td><div>ED 177066<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TEHALLEN <\/td><td><div>ED 177069<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900076#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900076#WRT03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax Collection","counter":864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900076#WRT03150"},{"type":"question","counter":865,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[32982\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900076#WRT03200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will consider rectifying the substantial additional cost which motorists who tax their vehicles on a quarterly basis must pay as opposed to those who tax their car annually, particularly in view of the fact that many persons find themselves not in a financial position to pay the full amount in one lump sum and the fact that administrative costs in relation to motor taxation are lessened in view of the fact that motorists now apply for their tax disk online; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":866,"content":"<p>I have no plans to change the basis for the charging of motor tax for three or six month discs.

Where a person ceases to be a member before age 50, whether voluntarily or as a result of failure to be re-elected, the gratuity will be paid when the person reaches age 50 and will be based on the representational payment applicable at that point. The Local Authority Members (Gratuity) (Amendment) Regulations, 2006 allows the gratuity to be paid before age 50 where retirement is due to permanent infirmity or where the member dies in office. <\/p><p>  The amount of the gratuity is calculated on the basis of 4\/20ths of a Councillor's Representational Payment for each year of service from 4 May 2000, subject to a maximum twenty years' service (i.e. four times the amount of the Representational Payment at the time of retirement). <\/p><p>  An additional <i>ex-gratia<\/i> payment may be made to Councillors serving on or after the date of the making of the 2006 Regulations in respect of service before 4 May 2000. The rates to be applied are dependent on the number of years' service and the category of local authority in which the Councillor served. Circular Letter S.3\/2007 of 22 January 2007, issued by my Department, set the rate of payment of the ex-gratia payment at &euro;714.23 for each year of service up to 20 years' service with a County Council or what was at the time a County Borough Corporation, at &frac12; this rate for service with what was at the time a Borough Corporation or an Urban District Council, and at &frac14; this rate for service as a Town Commissioner. For service in excess of 20 years prior to 4 May 2000, the foregoing rates are reduced by 1\/3rd for each additional year of service up to 20 years.  There is an overall limit of 40 years' service for the gratuity and ex-gratia payment combined, with the service reckoned for the purposes of a gratuity calculated first and the residual number of years being used to calculate any ex-gratia payment.   <\/p><p>  Having regard to the democratic process, it is not possible for local authorities to forecast the number of current elected members who will retire or fail to retain their seats following the forthcoming local elections.

Domestic waste water treatment systems are defined in the Act and include all drains associated with the discharge of domestic waste water, whether or not they discharge to a septic tank or waste water tank.  Irrespective of the age or type of system in place, if there is no evidence of risk to human health or the environment, no action will be necessary.   <\/p><p>  The Act also assigns responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency to make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  The National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems was published by the EPA in February 2013.  Details of the minimum number of inspections for each county are included in the Plan. It is the responsibility of the water services authorities to implement the Inspection Plan in their functional areas.  There will be no charge for inspections.     <\/p><p>  The Local Authority Services National Training Group, in consultation with my Department, the EPA and the water services authorities, has overseen the development and delivery of a training course for the local authority officials who will carry out inspections under the 2012 Act. The EPA is responsible for appointing as inspectors the officials who have satisfactorily completed the training course and meet other qualification criteria regarding professional or technical qualifications and indemnity insurance cover. <\/p><p>  Inspections will be objective, evidence-based and aimed at identifying systems which are a risk to public health or the environment.  There is no question of applying new standards, for example those of the EPA&rsquo;s 2009 Code of Practice, to older on-site systems, nor is there any question of a householder being directed to acquire additional land to facilitate remediation works.  Where an inspection reveals a problem with a domestic waste water treatment system, issues such as existing site size, hydrological and geological conditions etc. will be considered so as to identify the most appropriate, pragmatic and cost-effective remediation works required. With regard to the grants scheme for remediation of domestic waste water treatment systems, I refer to the reply to Questions 175 and 176 of 3 July 2013 which sets out the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900077#WRU02600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Residential Tenancies Board Enforcement","counter":901,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900077#WRU02650"},{"type":"question","counter":902,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[33123\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900077#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the recourse available to landlords who are unhappy with a ruling by the Private Residential Tenancies Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances. <\/p><p>  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance.  The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.

Details of the expected timeframes for the implementation of individual recommendations were set out in the implementation plan. Implementation of the majority of recommendations is progressing in a satisfactory manner. However, delays have arisen in some areas, particularly those requiring legal advice and\/or legislative change. My Department and the Agency have continued to liaise on implementation and I expect to publish a review of progress made in the near future.<\/p><p>  The review recommended that immunity from prosecution, as applicable to the EPA in carrying out its functions, be reconsidered. As set out in the implementation plan, I propose to consider this issue, which is likely to require primary legislation if it is decided to progress it, in the latter half of 2013. I note that the EPA is not the only Agency that currently has statutory immunity and it will be particularly important to examine the potential impact of any change in this provision on the ability of the EPA effectively to discharge its statutory functions.  Specifically in regard to health impacts, the review recommended the establishment of an additional specialist Advisory Committee to address the interface between the environment and human health. I understand that the Agency has since established an EPA Health Advisory Committee including representation from the Health Service Executive, Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Health, among others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900078#WRV02200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Collection","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900078#WRV02250"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[33328\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900078#WRV02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason there is a handling charge of &euro;10 when a person tries to pay the non-principal private residence tax when such a handling charge does not apply for payment with cheque, postal order, debit or credit card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>Subsection 4 of section 5 of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, enabled the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to prescribe a fee for the payment of a charge by a person attending at the offices of a local authority providing such payment services.

","asker":"1045","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1049,"content":"<p>The decision not to participate in the recast Asylum Procedures Directive was taken in September 2011.  That decision was informed by the fact that, had we decided to opt in to the measure, we could have faced the very real possibility of being bound by an outcome which would have been contrary to our fundamental interests in relation to the national asylum system.  Several elements of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive were identified as being particularly problematic aspects for the national asylum system at the time.<\/p><p>  Article 20 of the 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive, which Ireland participates in, provides for the procedure in the case of implicit withdrawal or abandonment of the application.  At present, the Article provides that such an application be subject to a decision to discontinue the examination or to reject the application on the basis that the applicant has not established an entitlement to protection.  It is the latter option which is applied under the Irish system, with a recommendation that the Minister refuse to give the applicant a declaration that he or she is a refugee and with no appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  In the proposal to recast the Procedures Directive, the Commission proposed that the option to refuse the application could only be taken on the basis of an adequate examination of its substance and further to a personal interview.  The amended proposal did provide for the possibility of a time limit of at least one year after which the case can no longer be reopened or a new application may be treated as a subsequent application.  However, the opinion at the time was that this amended Article would be unacceptable from an asylum policy perspective as it could result in a carousel of applications.<\/p><p>  Additionally, Article 23 of the 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive obliges Member States to ensure that the examination procedure is concluded as soon as possible.  In its proposed recast, the Commission proposed that Member States would ensure that the examination procedure was concluded within 6 months after the date the application is lodged, with a possible extension of a further 6 months in certain circumstances.  The opinion at the time was that these time limits could impose additional burdens on the national asylum system if there was a large increase in the number of applications to be examined in the State, especially considering previous increases in the period 2001 to 2003.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the provisions of the Protocol on the position of Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU apply.  In accordance with Article 1, 2 and Article 4a(1) of the Protocol, Ireland did not participate in the adoption of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive and is not subject to its application.  However, this is without prejudice to Article 4 of the Protocol under which Ireland may at any time after the adoption of a measure by the Council notify its intention to the Council and the Commission that it wishes to opt-in to the measure.<\/p><p>  As the instruments comprising the second phase of the Common European Asylum System have recently been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, the question of opting-in to the recast Procedures Directive and the other measures that comprise the CEAS can be kept under ongoing review having regard to the possibilities I refer to under the Protocol on the position of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I might add that any decision in this regard would have to take into consideration the operation of the Common Travel Area which we share with the United Kingdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900081#WRY02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1050,"content":"<p>Question No. 430 answered with Question No. 421.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Conventions Ratification","counter":1051,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900081#WRY02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1052,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[33370\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900081#WRY02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when he will sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

This policy has no impact on the definition of a breeding establishment nor on the obligation to hold a Meat Feeder Licence (MFL) as such a licence is required where a dog owner uses raw ABP under regulatory derogation as a source of feed, irrespective of the type of dog involved.<\/p><p>  The EU ABP Regulation allows the possibility of feeding raw ABP to dogs under a number of headings.  In particular the derogation under Article 18(1)(f) allows specified categories (Category 2 and Category 3) of ABP to be fed to &ldquo;dogs from recognised kennels and packs of hounds&rdquo;; and the derogation under Article 18(1)(g) allows the same for dogs in shelters.  Raw ABP is potentially a valuable source of feed for dogs in kennels, shelters and for packs of hounds. However, it can also represent a potential risk to both public and animal health, particularly the Category 2 material which is derived from fallen animals.

Applications submitted for afforestation in areas described as being potentially acid sensitive must be accompanied by the results of water sampling taken from the receiving watercourse in the months of February, March, April and May.  These results present a measure of alkalinity, reflecting the capacity of the surface water to buffer against acidification that may be connected to afforestation, and which may otherwise affect fish and other forms of aquatic life.  Under the protocol, afforestation is not permitted if any one of the four samples falls below a threshold level of alkalinity, which indicates that the sampled watercourse is sensitive to acidification. As a result of this protocol, afforestation has been generally restricted within these Acid Sensitive Areas.<\/p><p>  Up to recently, the agreed acid sensitivity protocol applied to all afforestation projects under the various support schemes available from my Department, including the planting of hardwoods (or broadleaves) under the general Afforestation Scheme.  However, in February of this year, my Department secured the agreement of the EPA to amend the protocol to allow applications under the Native Woodland Establishment Scheme, without the requirement for water sampling.  This amendment, supported by Inland Fisheries Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Heritage Council and the Woodlands of Ireland, was based on the ecological focus and the unique approach to establishment and management underpinning the Native Woodland Scheme, and the wide range of eco-system services new native woodlands can deliver, including the protection of water quality and aquatic life.<\/p><p>  It is important to highlight that quality hardwood production is strongly encouraged under the Native Woodland Establishment Scheme, where ecologically compatible and where realized using various &lsquo;close-to-nature&rsquo; forest management systems.  Wood production is a stated objective of many of the new native woodland projects funded under the scheme to date, and specific guidelines on establishing and management native woodlands for timber are available.  The Native Woodland Establishment Scheme offers farmers and other landowners located within Acid Sensitive Areas &ndash; and within other ecologically sensitive locations &ndash; an opportunity to avail of an afforestation scheme and associated grants and premiums, and to create a woodland resource compatible with various environmental sensitivities and capable of providing future revenue through the realization of quality hardwood.  In partnership with Woodlands of Ireland, the Forest Service will be holding training days for professional foresters over the coming weeks and months, aimed at promoting this use of the scheme as an option for farmers and other landowners within Acid Sensitive Areas and other sensitive locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900083#WRAAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":1131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900083#WRAAA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1132,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[33454\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900083#WRAAA01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"as world travelling circuses in Ireland are unable to adequately provide for the animals in their care, if he will consider backing a ban on the use of animals in Irish circuses in favour of a circus industry without animals, putting Ireland in line with dozens of countries around the world that have banned animal-act circuses, the most recent being Colombia and the U.K.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1133,"content":"<p>Concerns relating to conditions under which circus animals are kept and managed come under the scope of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1965.

The draft Bill provides for changing the criteria, under section 54 of the 2010 Act, where the High Court may authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent, in the case of a child who is in the care of prospective adopters and where that child&rsquo;s parents have failed in their parental duty to the child.  The draft Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents.  In the case of a child of married parents, both parents must place the child for adoption, and before doing so will be counselled and given information in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of the Adoption Act 2010. It is my intention to bring the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible, following conclusion of all proceedings and processes relevant to the Referendum.<\/p><p>  Work is also continuing in relation to the preparation of the Heads of Bill of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information to identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records.<\/p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis.  The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill.  It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.  It is also intended that prior to the release of adoption information, counselling will be offered by the Adoption Authority, the HSE or by an accredited body to an adopted person, a birth parent or to an adoptive parent.<\/p><p>  Complex legal and Constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill, including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy.  These issues are currently receiving careful examination within my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of Bill before Government at the earliest possible date.  However, there are undoubtedly challenges remaining in developing a workable framework which respects the Constitutional rights of all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900083#WRAAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Issues","counter":1159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900084#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1160,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[33547\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900084#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to concerns regarding child safety in a school (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Within this context, it has a responsibility to ensure that the health-related needs of children with special needs are addressed and that these children are appropriately supported in preschool and school settings.  This is done in a number of ways such as by providing grant-aid to support preschool provision in community preschools and by funding special preschools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  It also facilitates children with special needs to attend mainstream preschool by providing the necessary assistant supports.

This campaign is focussed on the cancer risk associated with sunbed use and builds on earlier work undertaken by the ICS in this regard. On a broader front, the Irish public has also, over recent years, benefitted from the Society's &quot;SunSmart Code&quot; highlighting the danger of overexposure to the sun and measures the public can take to minimise such exposure. There is now a much greater public awareness and understanding of the health risks associated with both exposure to the sun and the use of tanning devices.<\/p><p>  The apparent contradiction between the increase in skin cancers over the period from 1994 to 2010 on the one hand and the reduction in sunbed use indicated by the ICS research on the other hand can most probably be explained by the long latency period often associated with skin cancers - which can take many years to develop and present. The Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health has advised me that cohorts of the adult population who are at increased risk from UV radiation can best be dealt with by way of regulation rather than a prohibition. My Department has also been advised that prohibition on certain skin types would, in all likelihood, be incompatible with equality legislation.<\/p><p>  I can confirm that the forthcoming Public Health (Sunbeds) Bill will make it an offence to sell or hire a sunbed to a person under 18 years of age or allow such a person to use a sunbed on a sunbed premises. A test purchasing provision will also be set out in the Bill to support enforcement of the prohibition on the sale or hire of a sunbed to a person under 18 years of age or to allow such a person to use a sunbed on a sunbed premises. Breaches of this core provision will result in prosecution and very significant penalties will be available to the courts in cases of non-compliance.<\/p><p>  In addition to this prohibition on sunbed businesses from permitting persons under 18 years of age from using or hiring a sunbed, the legislation will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature aging and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include:-<\/p><p>  (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises;<\/p><p>  (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age;<\/p><p>  (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises;<\/p><p>  (iv) an exemption for medical purposes;<\/p><p>  (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); <\/p><p>  (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE;<\/p><p>  (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; <\/p><p>  (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; <\/p><p>  (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eye wear to users;<\/p><p>  (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises;<\/p><p>  (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices;<\/p><p>  (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware. <\/p><p>  On the matter of the research commissioned by the ICS, this survey indicated that, at most, 7 people in a sample of 1,000 aged between 15 and 24 had used a sunbed in 2010. From this, a estimated national figure of 28,000 was indicated for sunbed use in the 15-24 age category. While it is difficult to conclusively estimate a national usage figure from such a sample, it is important to point out that the 4% of respondents who used a sunbed  in 2010 represents a reduction from 9% in 2003 (a 55% reduction on the 2003 figure). The percentage of the 15-24 age category who use sunbeds is 5% and this has reduced from 10% in 2007 (a 50% decrease on the 2007 figure). <\/p><p>  In summary, the research indicates that significant reductions in the use of sunbeds have been recorded over the past number of years. Greater public awareness of the risks of sunbed use has been an important factor in this regard and the ICS is to be complimented for their work in promoting public awareness of the dangers associated with over-exposure to the sun and from sunbed use. The forthcoming sunbed legislation will build on this process and I am delighted to be in a position to confirm that my Department expects to complete the drafting of this legislation within the next 6-8 weeks. The legislation has been accorded priority drafting status and officials of my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the necessary drafting work. Once the drafting is completed, the legislation must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive prior to its publication and initiation of the Bill in the Oireachtas. This EU notification requirement will necessitate a minimum of three months to complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900084#WRBB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":1190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900084#WRBB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1191,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[32879\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900084#WRBB02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update in relation to the proposed development of a primary care centre in north Drogheda; when he anticipates that such a facility will be open to the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance. The Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes.<\/p><p>  The person's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income  and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It should be noted that it was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution would be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect. This is being progressed in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2013.<\/p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<\/p><p> 1. Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p><p> 2. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.<\/p><p> 3. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms\/businesses in certain circumstances.<\/p><p> 4. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<\/p><p> 5. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p> 6. If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p> 7. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.<\/p><p> 8. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. <\/p><p>  At end-May there were 21,979 people in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care. This figure includes both people in receipt of support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and people who have been in nursing home care since before the Scheme commenced and are in receipt of support under systems that pre-date the Scheme. An additional 727 people had been approved for funding, but were not yet in payment. This would be for a variety of reasons, e.g. the nursing home had not yet invoiced the HSE for payment or the individual waiting for a bed to become available in their nursing home of choice. A further 777 people were on the national placement list awaiting funding, with a waiting time of about 6 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900085#WRCC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Generic Drugs Substitution","counter":1229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900085#WRCC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1230,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[32959\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900085#WRCC01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients with epilepsy who have been switched to generic epilepsy medication; if he will provide the information by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1231,"content":"<p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, will introduce a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.

Under the legislation, generic substitution is not permitted until the products have been assessed for interchangeability in accordance with the criteria set out in the legislation and the IMB has decided to add the products to the List of Interchangeable Medicines.

The 12 professions to be regulated under the Act are clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  Five registration boards have been established to date and a sixth will be established shortly. The registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.<\/p><p>  Whilst the immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the twelve professions currently designated under the Act, as I indicated back in November 2012, I am committed to bringing counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  In relation to advertising, I feel that, given the timing and legal complexity of the issues involved, we should be focussing on achieving the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists rather than bringing forward primary legislation to require them to include a notification that they are not yet subject to statutory regulation.  Notwithstanding that a number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups have come together as the Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice for the professions in so far as is possible,  a number of issues are still being clarified.  <\/p><p>  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and\/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession.  The QQI Report is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2014.  In addition, the standards of proficiency to be required of existing practitioners for registration will need to be established and the necessary qualifications prescribed.<\/p><p>  The Department will be engaging with the Psychological Therapies Forum and other relevant stakeholders as soon as the QQI report is available and will work through the outstanding issues with a view to achieving regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists as soon as possible in the best interests of the protection of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900087#WREE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":1304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900087#WREE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1305,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[33170\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900087#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an application for a medical card now under review\/appeal in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kilkenny will be expedited and approved based on the medical evidence provided and the fact that the couple cannot afford the medication and care needed.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1306,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The Bill is putting this arrangement into a modernised and simplified legal framework which is not designed to generate any additional revenue.<\/p><p>  -  These contributions will apply to all those provided with residential care by or on behalf of the HSE, other than those covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and those in acute hospital care.<\/p><p>  -  A Fair Deal type arrangement is not planned for extension to the Disability or Mental Health Sectors at present, but is being considered within the context of the current review of the Fair Deal Scheme.

A comprehensive symptomatic breast service is available for women in the eight designated cancer centres. Most cases of breast cancer arise in women with no apparent close family history. The majority of people with a family history of breast cancer will not be at substantially increased risk. <\/p><p>  Women at increased risk of breast cancer due to their family history have a specific range of strategies currently available to reduce their risk. For those for whom risk-reducing surgery is unsuitable or unacceptable, chemoprevention using drugs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene may represent a more acceptable means of risk reduction. <\/p><p>  Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer for women without a personal history but who have an increased risk of the disease. As they are not currently licensed for chemoprevention in well women with a family history of breast cancer in Ireland, they can only be prescribed by a doctor following professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision and documenting informed consent from the patient. It is not appropriate to offer them to all women aged over 35 years with a family history of breast and related cancers. Drug licensing in Ireland is the responsibility of the Irish Medicines Board. <\/p><p>  All drugs have side effects and risks which are particularly important when they are being used to prevent other diseases. Discussion and information should include the side effects of drugs, the extent of risk reduction, and the risks and benefits of alternative approaches, such as risk-reducing surgery and surveillance. Discussions in relation to risk of cancer of the lining of the womb, or blood clotting and in relation to bone health are of particular importance for tamoxifen and raloxifene.<\/p><p>  The communication of information on cancer risk and carrier probability is complex. There is a degree of uncertainty with respect to the probability of inheriting a predisposing genetic mutation, of gene penetrance and hence of developing cancer.  People who are concerned about a family history of breast cancer may require information to help them deal with the complex medical and social choices linked with different levels of breast cancer risk management options, and support to cope with the associated uncertainty and anxiety. <\/p><p>  The National Cancer Control Programme will be examining the most recent guidance, published this month, on Familial Breast Cancer from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK in relation to the management of chemoprevention and other aspects of the care of patients with a family history of breast cancer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900089#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1398,"content":"<p>Question No. 553 answered with Question No. 545.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":1399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900089#WRGG01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1400,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[33467\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070900089#WRGG01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence regarding the plight of an orthodontic patient (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1401,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to patients based on their level of clinical need.
