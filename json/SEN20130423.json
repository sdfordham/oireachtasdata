We have held discussions in the past.  I raised specific issues here.  For example, the C&uacute;ram centre in Swords in north County Dublin, which has the largest catchment area of 78,000 persons in the country, has been moved out of its offices and day clinic and has been shoe-horned into the back of a medical centre.  It has insufficient space to hold a day-care centre, so much so - this is where Government is prioritising mental health funding - that a new psychologist who has been appointed to this centre must work out of Coolock as there is not even room for that individual to work in this centre.  A second psychologist, who is due to return from maternity leave in four weeks' time, cannot join the team in Swords and must work out of Balbriggan, and two of the psychiatric nurses work from another office.  I raised this directly with the Minister as an example of our adult mental health services.  If Government is serious about tackling mental health, we should not only fund it appropriately, but ensure that the physical infrastructure is there for them to do so.<\/p> <p>These are specific examples which five months ago the Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated he would look into, but there has been no response from him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300004#C01100","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366729800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Is the Senator proposing an amendment to the Order of Business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300005#D00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1366729800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>No, because I ask the Leader to give a commitment that in the coming weeks he will set aside some time for a proper serious debate on adult mental health services with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is responsible for this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300005#D00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1366729800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I congratulate those involved in making the student transition year challenge such a success.

I also congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, and also C&aacute;it Hayes and others from the communications unit who were involved.  It took a great deal of work to set it up.  Hundreds of students from throughout the country were asked to submit essays and the best essay writers were chosen to come to Leinster House.

The Government has committed that &euro;300 million worth of savings must be made this year and its preference, strongly expressed in recent weeks and months, is to proceed by way of consensus.

Two motions which were voted on will be of interest to the House.  One was on Scouting Ireland's fears the proposed sale of Coillte will threaten its open access policy.  Unbeknownst to me until I arrived, another motion had been tabled calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality to enact legislation requiring ISPs operating in Ireland to block access to all child abuse material, as has been done in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Malta, Italy and Britain.  I have raised this issue in the House and we have had a good discussion on it.  Scouting Ireland voted unanimously on the motion.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has committed that blocking will be fully considered in the context of the development of the planned sexual offences Bill.  I am very concerned this Bill is scheduled for 2014.  This is an urgent matter.  It is about protecting real children from real abuse in the real world.  I call on the Leader to convey to the Minister a request to bring forward a separate Bill to deal with this distinctly.<\/p><p>Today is the national day of action and raising public awareness on direct provision.  I am disappointed and confused the Adjournment matter I addressed to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has been ruled out of order.  Since the introduction of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009, asylum seekers cannot ever be considered habitually resident in the State.  Since access to most welfare payments, including supplementary welfare allowance, is now restricted to those habitually resident in the State, and since asylum seekers cannot be considered habitually resident, I asked what is the legislative basis for the continued accommodation and payments made to asylum seekers.<\/p> <p>This is a question for the Minister for Social Protection.  For example, the payment slips to asylum seekers refer to the Department of Social Protection.  However, I take the Leader on his word that the Minister has no responsibility for this matter, even though the payment slips clearly state \"Department of Social Protection\".  I am now being directed back to the Department of Justice and Equality where I did not get an answer to this question last week, so I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on direct provision.  I have been moved from one Department to another on this issue, yet nobody is willing to take responsibility for it.  I believe that we are operating outside a legislative basis with the payments.  We need an answer to this question, rather than being shuttled between Departments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300005#D00500","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366730100,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I would like to endorse both the issues and concerns that Senator van Turnhout has raised - in particular, the one concerning Internet service providers.

The Senator's second issue was no less important.<\/p><p>  I would be grateful if the Leader could arrange for the Minister for Health to attend the House to discuss what the Government's plans are on abortion.  It seems that this issue is being debated everywhere except in this House.  I am not happy or impressed by the manner in which, on the one hand, the Government is not communicating with many interested stakeholders but, on the other hand, we are being subjected to the raising of hares, leaks and counter-leaks about what the Government intends to do.<\/p><p>  The confusion on this issue was expressed in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> today which stated, incorrectly I believe, that a small group of Fine Gael TDs and Senators remain firmly opposed to the Government's expressed strategy of giving legal clarity on abortion in cases where the mother's life is at risk.  Let us be clear, everybody agrees that there must be clarity about when it is legitimate to intervene to protect a mother's life, which must always be done.  The issue is suicide and there is no getting away from it.  That is why it was a charade at the weekend to be talking about a panel of any kind deciding something for which there is no medical basis. <\/p><p>  I would draw the attention of the House, including the Leader, to the latest research from Professor David Ferguson who is a pro-choice voice but a scholar who tells the truth on the issues.  This was published in the <i>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry<\/i>.  Professor Ferguson finds that there is no available evidence to suggest that abortion has therapeutic effects in reducing the mental health risks of an unwanted or unintended pregnancy.  He concludes that there is suggestive evidence that abortion may be associated with small to moderate increases in risks of some mental health problems, risks of anxiety, alcohol misuse and suicidal behaviour.  He goes on to say that these conclusions have important, if uncomfortable, implications for clinical practice and the interpretation of the law in those jurisdictions which require abortion to be authorised on medical grounds. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300006#E00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1366730100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300006#E00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1366730100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>It is quite clear that there is a political push on to legislate for abortion in circumstances for which there is no medical basis.

Who else is on this oversight committee and how come nobody else has access to the process of deliberation that is going on the whole time?<\/p><p>At the all-party Oireachtas committee hearings, we clearly heard they encountered no situation where there was a mental health ground justifying abortion based on suicidal ideation.  Why therefore is this push on, apparently from within the Government?  This cannot end happily either for the unborn or for the women most concerned.  It is vital that the Government pauses this issue now and focuses on satisfying the decision of the European Court of Human Rights by giving clarity on necessary medical interventions in all cases, in physical conditions where that is not in dispute.  However, this bad idea of allowing abortion on any mental health ground, without any medical or scientific basis for it, is just bad public policy and irresponsible politics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300006#E00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1366730100,"counter":28,"content":"<p>As my party's spokesperson on tourism and sport, I welcome today's announcement by B&amp;B Ireland of the significant rise in bookings received in the bed and breakfast and guesthouse sector for the first three months of this year.

One hears this point from people on the street and I believe the Government's opinion is exactly the same.  I have never met anyone, apart perhaps from the officials themselves, who would try to justify the figures, which without question are outrageous.  I accept that even were they lower, it would not make any significant difference to the balance sheet of the State.  Surely, however, that is not the issue because it was agreed from the outset that austerity would be spread across the board.  People at the very lowest level of income have been obliged to bear the burden of such austerity.  What I find difficult to understand, this also is from where Senator O'Brien is coming, is that while everyone is clear on this position, these officials come across as the untouchables.  I cannot understand how this can be the case because ultimately, they would not have a job had not the taxpayers bailed out the banks.  This is the logic of what Members are dealing with in this regard and if there is an opportunity for the Minister to indicate the feeling that is abroad among the taxpayers - which I believe to be shared right across the board - such an opportunity should not be lost.  Senator O'Brien also has raised this point but if there is some protocol or something about this debate that Members do not understand, they should be told what it is.  On the face of it, however, Members have a difficulty with the remuneration some of the aforementioned officials are receiving.  Unless a specific opportunity is availed of, such as that which now arises in which the Minister can quite clearly vote against such remuneration, there will always be people who are suffering and who feel dissatisfied with the manner in which these officials genuinely are getting away.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to try to find out precisely what is the position.  He might ascertain the reason Members are left in a cul-de-sac and no answers are forthcoming.  He might try to find out the reason there is no logic to this debate - because there is none - and therefore unless answers are found, I genuinely believe the ordinary person in the street will not continue to bear the austerity measures with the patience and fortitude I have shown.  There is no patience, no fortitude and absolutely no generosity on the part of the officials involved.  This matter should be tackled straight away and if the Minister is not in a position to express people's dissatisfaction on behalf of the State and if there is some reason for this, Members should have a full debate in this House on the matter to tease out precisely the reason we find ourselves in this position.

It is unhelpful, therefore, for certain politicians to be playing politics with this.  This bridge was considered by all parties.  Members of all parties had their views, both for and against, not only those on the Unionist side.  It is important to remember that.

I support him in the call he has made for common sense to prevail and for people to stop playing games with this issue which is far too important.<\/p><p>I raise the issue of social housing and housing in general.  On a number of occasions in this House the Sinn F&eacute;in party has raised the issue of housing.  Last year we used Private Members' time, the sole opportunity we have on a yearly basis, to raise the issues of provision of social housing and rent supplement.  We saw a crisis which was evident at that time and which, unfortunately, has got much worse since then.<\/p><p>As Senators will know, in this State we have had a major change in policy in social housing over the past ten years, away from local authorities to building social housing blocks or estates and being given funding to do so.  There was Part 5 social and affordable housing and also the private rented sector.  I agree with part of the policy and do not agree with other parts.  We have now found ourselves in a situation where local authorities do not have any money to build any social housing.  Part 5 goes to the private sector and new builds have completely dried up.  There are no new builds and no new housing stock coming into play.  The vast majority of housing needs are being met through the private rented sector, either through rent supplement or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  What we see now is a crisis within a crisis.  I can testify to that in terms of my own dealings with people in Waterford who are either in RAS houses or waiting to get into them.  We have a crisis within a crisis where there is a reduction in the amount of money people can get through rent supplement and there have been changes to rent caps.<\/p> <p>At present, landlords, mainly in Dublin but also in other urban areas throughout the State, are either unable or unwilling to repay their mortgages.  As a result, their properties are being repossessed by the banks and RAS applicants are simply being turfed out.  There is no support for the latter.  We need to return to the drawing board in the context of the provision of social housing in the State.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on housing?  There are many facets to this matter, including mortgage distress - this is a hugely important issue and the Government has not done enough in respect of it - and the crisis in social housing, and they must be dealt with.  I would welcome it if the Leader made time available for a debate on this important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300009#H01100","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366731900,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I support Senator Cullinane's call for a debate on housing.  I have raised this matter on previous occasions in the House.  In view of the fact that there are massive housing lists in place at present, it is important to pose the question as to why so many thousands of people are obliged to live in dreadfully inadequate conditions when there are tens of thousands of vacant accommodation units throughout the country.  As in the past, the relevant Departments must come together to resolve this matter.  This State has experienced many economic problems since its foundation.  During periods of economic difficulty in the 1930s, the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1980s, the then Governments - which were of a variety of political hues - invested money in housing programmes.  Such programmes ensured people were given decent homes in which to live.  The thinking which obtained in respect of this matter in the past must come to the fore again.  We must try to deal with the housing crisis because the obvious social problems and problems relating to crime to which it is giving rise need to be addressed.  I support the call for an urgent debate on this matter.<\/p><p>I wish to comment briefly on the current economic situation and the Government's decision earlier today to re-engage with the trade union movement.  I support that decision because talk is better than confrontation.  However, we must be realistic in our discussions with the trade union movement and with the public sector unions in particular.  In that context, we must ensure that no one becomes removed from reality.  The Government must save &euro;1 billion on public sector pay and pensions.  We must ensure we have a public sector in respect of which we can afford a pay and pensions bill and which the economy can afford to sustain into the future.  There may have been difficulties with the deal that was previously on offer and perhaps it might be possible to consider a tweaking of that arrangement.  However, the message must go out loud and clear from those on the political side of the debate that the &euro;1 billion in savings to which I refer must come from within the public sector.  Taxpayers and those in the private sector can pay no more and those in the latter sector who lost their jobs can afford to lose no more.  That is the economic reality in which this country still finds itself.  That reality must be taken into account in the context of any negotiations which take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300010#J00200","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1366731900,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I completely agree with my colleague, Senator Mullen, that the Government's approach to legislating on the abortion issue is completely unsatisfactory.  I say this because the issue of health is not being addressed as part of the process.  I refer, in particular, to situations where young girls might be the victims of incest or rape.  It is absolutely unconscionable that people should try to force a young woman who might be in such a position to carry a baby to full term in order to satisfy their consciences and nothing else.  I was not surprised to hear distinguished medical experts refer to this matter.  One such expert indicated that what is going on is reminiscent of the Taliban, while another likened it to what happened during the Inquisition.  I cannot understand how anybody would want to proceed as has been suggested.  Of course, no young person would be forced to have an abortion.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen also indicated that he is not impressed with the Government's lack of communication with the stakeholders involved.  I support the Senator's call for a debate on this matter and I would like those stakeholders to be identified during any such debate.  I would like to know who those stakeholders are and who Senator Mullen believes are the people who need the information to which he refers.<\/p> <p>We have to be careful when we quote so-called experts.  I have not had the pleasure of reading Mr. Ferguson's analysis.  I am sure he is a highly distinguished man.  Certainly, he brought Pat Kenny to indignant life this morning on the wireless when Senator Mullen produced all this stuff.  Coincidentally, this morning I received a distinguished paper from someone on completely the other side.  I am supporting the call for a debate on this issue.<\/p><p>There are two other matters I wish to raise quickly.  Will the Leader confirm for me, if he can, the outrageous allegation - it is even more outrageous if it is true - that the ECB instructed the IBRC not to comply with freedom of information requests from interested parties in terms of the banks?  It is outrageous if someone in Europe was telling us that we cannot release information to our citizens under the Freedom of Information Act, which is domestic legislation.  This I find absolutely shocking.<\/p><p>I agree with everyone who spoke on the matter that it was immensely reassuring to hear those wonderful young people and to read their essays.  One or two of them were quite brilliant.  There was a note of real sadness - I am sure the Cathaoirleach detected it himself - in those who said that to their immense regret they were afraid that because of economic circumstances they might not find a future in this country.  I found that really troubling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300010#J00300","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366732500,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I wanted to raise the matter of the Marketplace Fairness Act, which has got the backing of the Senate in the United States.  It is designed to force online retailers like Amazon, eBay and such sites to collect state and local sales taxes.  This could mean changes for Ireland and I am keen to know exactly what it could mean for Irish consumers and businesses.  The intent is to ensure that online retailers and bricks-and-mortar shops are competing on a level playing field.  However, I am concerned about how exactly it will be implemented and the way it could potentially impact.<\/p><p>It is uncertain at this stage how it will operate for consumers in the EU.  All of us know how VAT is applied when an Irish consumer buys from the United Kingdom or France but it is not entirely certain how this would apply in the case of buying from the USA.  There is a possibility of our being charged US sales tax and Irish VAT.  This seems to me to be a distinct possibility.<\/p><p>From a political perspective any significant change such as this in US taxation policy needs to be watched closely by us.  Ireland has a great strategic interest in the US and given that the level of investment in both directions is at unprecedented levels, we need to monitor such Acts, which could have an impact on us.  I wish to find out with certainty what it means for Ireland, Irish consumers and Irish business, as it poses several questions for businesses which operate here and there.  Although it is not something I expect the Minister for Finance to come to debate as a full debate, I would be grateful if it could be included as part of a larger debate when he is next in the House.<\/p><p>I echo the suggestion of Senator O'Brien to have a debate on adult mental health services.

With water charges and the property tax coming down the line, a further &euro;2 billion or &euro;2.5 billion remaining to be taken out of the economy, although on which no decision has been made, and taking into account the &euro;300 million in savings that would have been made following the passage of Croke Park II, up to &euro;3 billion will be removed from the economy.

Second, the car scrappage scheme increased the number of jobs in the motor industry by creating an economic stimulus.  If the Government is seeking examples because it may be soft on this issue or because some of its economists are making flawed judgments, I have provided two perfect examples of stimulus packages working.

My interest was tweaked when, at the weekend, I read on a full page spread in one of the Sunday publications the news that the former Clancy Barracks development of 420 units was being sold by an international auctioneering firm, which I assume is operating under the instruction of receivers, themselves operating under the instruction of NAMA.  NAMA, an organ of this State that is obliged to accrue as much money for the State as possible, will effectively sell 420 dwelling units for a super value per unit, most likely to international equity investors.<\/p><p>As tens of thousands of young Irish people are struggling to get on the property ladder, this is a wonderful opportunity.  Be it in the form of a local authority, the Department of the Environment, Culture and Local Government or other established bodies, the State could purchase the units at the prices NAMA or the receivers will achieve and sell them as affordable housing.  The State has a magnificent history of providing affordable housing, mainly to young people starting their homes.<\/p><p>It is a scandal that we are going to give international investors the opportunity to double or quadruple their money.  How much they will receive is unknown because NAMA is forcing the sale.  At &euro;1,000 per unit, the development could be sold for &euro;420,000.  At &euro;10,000, it would be &euro;4.2 million.  At &euro;20,000, it would be almost &euro;9 million.  We would not collapse any market by buying at &euro;20,000 per unit and giving citizens an opportunity to buy an affordable dwelling.<\/p><p>We should debate housing, a matter that covers several Departments.

It makes no sense that people who worked for all of their lives and put some savings aside will end up with less money than those who sat on their proverbial rears and did not save anything.

As this process has not yet concluded, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to express an opinion at the institution's AGM.  However, it is a serious matter and I hope that we can revert to it soon.<\/p><p>In the past 12 months, the House has held three debates on adult mental health services, but we can arrange a further debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has spent a good deal of time discussing that and other matters in her portfolio in the House.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik and others who were present referred to today's excellent session with young people, who made bright, constructive, articulate and thought-provoking presentations.

I suppose people tend to forget such things.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett mentioned that heads of universities have been making disparaging remarks about young people leaving secondary schools.  I noted the Minister's comments on the issue and I share Senator Barrett's views on it.  Senator D'Arcy commented on the view that an &euro;18 million bridge project is being delayed by politics, arguing that politics are not causing the delay.  He called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, to provide a timescale and ensure that the project remains on schedule.

He also noted the wonderful young people we had in the House earlier today.  Senator Noone spoke about the regulation of online retailers in the US and how we should monitor the impact on Ireland and the EU.  I also note her comments regarding mental health.  I should clarify the position of the Deputy Leader for Senator Healy Eames.  She was the acting Leader last week when she was responding to questions on the Order of Business from the other side of the House.

From that point of view I am seriously concerned that, because of the population weighting and the geographical spread of the new configuration, my county and County Sligo will both lose out as has happened with every other regional organisation that I have been involved with, been aware of or have noticed in my part of the country.  Going way back to the regional tourism organisations, where there is a dominant county, it sucks in everything.  It is not something people set out to do or which is laid out in policy but it inevitably happens that the larger county will take over in terms of personnel, policy and a whole range of other things.  That is where my main concern lies.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot legislate just for Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim but he has already used his considerable intellectual powers and capacity to ensure a level playing pitch in other areas of this legislation, particularly regarding the representation at local authority level so I hope he will be able to do a Solomon-like judgment in relation to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300016#P00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1366735200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I support Senator Mooney 100% in what he has put forward.

I appreciate the costs involved in the current electoral system to VECs.  It is very costly, but all we are asking is that the Minister accept this amendment that the parents will be chosen through a ballot at local level.  It is the most democratic way for parents who have children attending schools under the control or governorship of the ETBs.  The parents of the young people attending schools under the control of the Cavan and Monaghan education and training board should be afforded the opportunity to pick their own representatives.  I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do.  All we are asking him to do is to accept this amendment and ensure that some mechanism, with as little cost as possible involved, would be used to give ownership to the parents and give the representatives a mandate to represent them at local level and not to pass it through to the national bodies.

On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il I introduced a series of amendments in this area.  The Bill now provides that the Minister of the day must specify at least one body that is representative of learners and which will have nomination rights to the ETB.  It also required ETBs to appoint five members along with the other 16 members, at least one of whom is representative of learners.  Where an ETB is centrally focused on adult learning provision, it is free to appoint a second learner representative, but not all VECs will be the same.  In establishing the ETBs this is unlikely to change, nor is it desirable that they be shoe-horned into a one-size-fits-all model.<\/p><p>I talked before in this House on the adaptability and the ready response to emerging need which this sector exhibits.  It is one of its best qualities.  Local needs are, by definition, different.  The better approach here is to ensure that learners are represented while allowing ETBs to tailor other aspects of their representation to the communities they serve.  We must also achieve this in such a way that the size of the new boards is not unnecessarily large.  We have struck the right balance here and I am not inclined to accept amendment No. 3.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 4, the existing legislation provides that two members of VEC will be elected by parents of students in VEC schools or centres for education.  In this Bill I propose that the two parent representatives must be parents of ETB students, something that is not a requirement now.  These two people will cease to be members if they no longer have a child as a student in an ETB school.  They will be appointed through a nomination process involving the recognised national association of parents.  The arguments have already been made around the need for there to be local voice of parents on ETBs, people who genuinely represent the needs and concerns of their community and I agree with this.  I see the merit in it.  To give life to such a commitment, it is vital that parents' representatives continue to have children in the ETB schools.  If the person no longer has a child in an ETB facility, an opportunity should be given to another parent, who has such a child, to serve on the board.  This is consistent with the approach taken to ETB members who cease to be local authority members or staff with the ETB.<\/p><p>On the question of elections versus nominations, from experience the reality is that elections for parents' representatives have proven to be cumbersome and costly.  The total estimated electorate is more than 100,000 people, each of whom must be written to twice under the current arrangements.  Participation rates in elections are not high, with an average turnout of 10%.  Some VECs have recorded turnouts as low as 1%.  While we are moving to a system of nominations we are strengthening the connection of parents with their education and training board, and the local dimension, by ensuring those appointed are parents of children in that ETB and not merely representative of those parents.<\/p><p>I have been anxious not to be prescriptive about how parents are to be nominated because I recognise that there are different approaches to this.  If a national association wishes to engage in an election-type process, it is free to do this.  The modalities of this, however, should be left to those recognised bodies and for these reasons I do not propose to accept amendment No. 4 in this primary legislation.  We have made provision to have representatives of business and the educational stakeholders and we can specify that in the statutory instruments and if there are changes in the landscape or circumstances, they can be changed.  To put this into primary legislation would be too restrictive.  If one is no longer a member of a local authority one can no longer be a member of an ETB board.  If one is no longer a staff member and represent the staff section on the board, one can no longer be on an ETB board.<\/p> <p>It would inconsistent if one's right to be a member was as a parent and one's child was no longer in the school to be treated differently from either a local authority or staff member.  However, there are two free spaces with only three dedicated to business, learners and educational stakeholders.  I am sure, therefore, that someone such as the Senator would be able to display not only his rhetorical skills but his lobbying skills with great effect.  I have been amazed by the strength of the enormously small population of County Leitrim in persuading larger congregations of thousands to recognise the quality of the representation from the county.  I have no doubt the Senator will find his way on to the relevant board in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300016#P00600","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366735800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I support the comments of my colleagues about the need to have local parental involvement.  The amendments are not prescriptive because we did not want to use complicated language in primary legislation.  They simply provide for a ballot of local people and this allows flexibility for the Minster and the Department to work out the best way of doing that.  It does not have to be a complicated or expensive process.  One day could be nominated on which people would have to attend to vote with the polls open for a few hours.  That is the reason the amendments are general.  We do not propose that the Department should run an overly expensive or cumbersome system but, at the same time, there is a need to ensure transparency and there is also a need for parents to feel an involvement in the process and an opportunity to take part and stand for election rather than nominating somebody.  That will not take away from the national bodies that do good work and that need more support.  Last year the parent's council organised a conference to which it invited its counterparts in Scotland to talk about the work they do.  They referred to the emphasis that has been put on parental involvement and education there.  We traditionally have not been great in Ireland at getting parents involved as active stakeholders in education.  This is one aspect of that and we deliberately did not make the language too detailed.  If the Minister accepted the amendments, it would be within his capacity and that of his officials to come up with a system with a local element.  It is important to insist on that local element.  I acknowledge the Minister's comment that some ETBs might do it this way but others might add an additional learner.  When a requirement is provided for, everybody takes it seriously and it would be seen as a signal from the Minister that he wants the boards to make sure that they make an effort to involve parents and that is the spirit in which we tabled the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300017#Q00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366735800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1366735800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<blockquote><br \/>In page 29, line 16, after &quot;parents,&quot; to insert the following:<br \/>&quot;who have been chosen through a ballot of local parents,&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300017#Q00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1366735800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300017#Q00500","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366735800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366735800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 5:\r\nIn page 32, to delete lines 3 to 10 and substitute the following:\r\n&#8220;(c) in the case of a person appointed under section 30(1)(c), and subject to subsection (2), he or she ceases to be the parent of--(i) any child who has not reached 18 years of age and is registered as a student in a centre for education or recognised school, or\r\n(ii) a learner in a children detention school, prison, education or training facility or other facility maintained by any other public service body where the board provides education or training.&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1366735800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>On Committee Stage, Senator Bacik raised a drafting issue.

I think we both agreed that the matter, a somewhat sensitive issue, was being dealt with as best as possible.<\/p><p>For the benefit of the House, I understand that there are three permanent full-time CEOs who will be surplus to requirements and who have been reassigned, but also, from my interpretation of the debate, that when any further vacancy arises under the ETBs they will be given priority.<\/p><p>Since that debate, I discovered that there are some 13 acting CEOs across the country, some of whom have been in their positions for in excess of four years.  But for a Government embargo - previous Governments introduced embargoes and I am not attempting to score a political point as it is an economic reality that a Government embargo is in place - it is almost certain that all of those 13 would have been given permanent positions.  I understand that they met recently where the matter and our debate arose in discussion.<\/p><p>They are being somewhat badly treated in the sense that the State is not getting good value for money in the manner in which it is adopting its approach.  These are staff who have been giving service but who have acquired enormous expertise, far beyond what was in their original positions.  Many of them were school principals but have now had two, three, four or in excess of four years' experience as administrative officers controlling significant budgets to a greater or lesser extent depending on from where they come.<\/p><p>I think we both agreed that this is not really something that can be dealt with in primary legislation.  All I ask is that there should be some reflection on their status and indication given as to how they will be treated if any of them is interested in pursuing any future vacancy and that, at the very least, they would be treated in the same way.<\/p><p>I have had this matter raised at VEC level where the counter argument is to the effect of why I should raise this because after all they have jobs to go back to.  In the current climate where employees are losing work and are finding themselves, to use that awful term, &quot;downsized&quot;, those 13 acting CEOs will revert in most cases to the positions they held.  I am not familiar with all of them, but my VEC's acting CEO - incidentally, neither he nor any other acting CEO discussed this with me - will revert to school principal.  He and the others will not lose their jobs.  I have had this raised by colleagues asking why I am complaining and why I should raise this when after all they still have their jobs and they will not lose anything.  However, they are losing and the State is also losing.  On suggesting that they would go back into the mix and will not be given any sort of acknowledgement of the expertise that they built up, the counter argument was that if there is a group of staff who apply for a future vacancy for a CEO under the ETBs, why should anybody be treated differently, everybody should be treated on their merits and every applicant should be treated on the basis of what he or she brings to the table.  I would counter argue that in this instance it is about a particular expertise, and where appointments have been made in the past, inevitably and rightly, their previous experience has been taken into account in appointing them to the particular position, be it a post of responsibility, such as deputy principal or principal, up to CEO.  Of course, the person's previous experience has been taken into account in assessing whether he or she is the person most capable of taking on a job.  Why should it be any different, particularly with this group of staff?<\/p><p>I do not want to labour the point.  The Minister is fully aware of from where I am coming.  I do not want to over egg the pudding other than to say that perhaps there could be some reflection within the Department of Education and Skills in the future, and with the Minister's intervention.  We are not patronising each other here.  The Minister has the intellectual capacity to be able to go beyond what I am raising here.  I do not have a particular solution for this.  All I suggest is that they should not be left swinging in the wind and that, if they are applying for a vacancy of CEO, they should be treated the same as the three CEOs who will be treated differently when those applications come before the relevant selection board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300018#R01000","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1366736400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>The Minister half-answered this question on the Bill on the previous occasion.

The previous Administration embarked on reform and rationalisation of a series of public agencies, including the VECs.  It was my predecessor, former Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who, in the process of anticipating a rationalisation down from 33, prudently, on the advice of civil servants, stated that the Department did not want to create difficulties where a vacancy occurs in a situation as would be normal in the public service and that position was likely to be amalgamated with another one.  It made sense to create an acting position rather than, as would have been the norm, a permanent one but they would, presumably, hold permanency in their previous job within the organisation for which they worked.<\/p><p>There were, from memory, in round figures, 20 permanent CEOs for 16 positions.  That was finally resolved through a seniority system based on length of service in that position as a CEO and choices were made on how applicants applied for different posts.  It took quite a bit of time.  There was much effort taken by both the representatives of the CEOs and the assistant secretary in the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>A resolution was found for those who took up the posts and for permanent CEOs who did not have the seniority to get what they would have liked.  A practical rational arrangement was made in the southern part of the country in anticipation of people retiring, which considered where people would ultimately end up, and in light of this put them in a particular position for five to seven years.  This was done in a very open and transparent way.  It was very sensible because if one is in a place for less than 18 months one will have less engagement with it than if one knows one will be there for a longer period of time.  All of these decisions were predicated on the basis that we want this fairly massive transformation to be successful and we want those in leadership positions to feel secure, respected and valued for what they can do.  Acting and full CEOs are in this leadership capacity.  This is a very big change.  Senators have seen the size of the legislation and know what they have dealt with, and on the ground its effect is considerable.<\/p><p>To reply to Senator Wilson, we envisage that all change will happen on one day and that when VEC X closes on a Friday, ETB X will open on Monday.  The telephones and banking systems will continue and nothing is disrupted.  The service to the public must be maintained.  A working group is actively examining these matters.  Of the existing VECs, eight have the same computer system.  Logically we want all of them to have the same computer system so they can talk to each other.  We are trying to transition from where we are today to a point some time in the future when this will happen.  The super-CEOs, if I can call them that, those who will become the CEOs of the new ETBs will only assume their legal powers once the legislation is activated.  Until now a location may have a sitting CEO and an acting CEO, with the new CEO coming from a different territory with no powers as such, other than persuasion and good manners, with regard to what is happening.<\/p><p>In these difficult times, when many in the public service feel unsure about where they are because of what has been discussed in recent times, I am conscious it is in everybody's interest to have the most accommodating and flexible type of response to the changes that will occur.  We are interested in success.  We have a vested interest collectively that this transformation is successful.  Those to whom the Senator referred are among those in key positions; they are not the only people in such positions but they are among them.  I have spoken at some length with the senior official involved and the Secretary General about the fact that we must make this transition and transfer seamlessly without disruption to the citizens deriving the service, the schools being managed through VECs and the staff themselves.<\/p><p>To answer Senator Wilson's question, it is my intention to commission the 16 new ETBs prior to the end of June, and sooner possible.  It will be predicated on whether the single ETB will work on the Monday as the separate VECs had worked on the previous Friday, in whatever shape or form this was.  It sounds easy to say but much must be done.<\/p><p>With regard to the statutory instruments we will examine whether we can accommodate the spirit of what was clearly articulated in the House on reconciling practical representation of local parents with the logistics I have put on the record of the House.

The school employs 36 people, of which 25 are teachers, seven special needs assistants, two clerical officers and two maintenance staff.  A large proportion of the enrolment of 479 students, or 149 of them, are being taught in prefabricated accommodation situated to the rear of the school building.  Only four of the 12 permanent classrooms have running water.  The annual bill for rented prefabricated accommodation is &euro;58,847.  The new enrolments over the past number of years are as follows: 2010 it was 57; 2011 it was 67; and in 2012, which is the current academic school year, there was 74 additional enrolments.<\/p><p>There is a major health and safety issue with the school.

Often there is a funeral, wedding or mass at the church when children arrive at school in the morning.  Recently I was at the school when children were being dropped off and there was an obvious hazard.  The school is doing everything that it can and its caretaker looks after the arrivals of cars, buses and so forth.  Safety is a critical issue.<\/p><p>With regard to school accommodation, I never agreed with prefabricated accommodation even when my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, was in government and there was lots of money being spent.  The money should have gone into bricks and mortar.  Children should have proper classroom accommodation.  That is not too much to ask.  The health and safety concerns, the prefabricated accommodation, coupled with close to 500 children playing on concrete at the back of the school at lunchtime and break times, a lack of running water, toilet and sanitary facilities and so on is totally unacceptable.  A new school on a new site would be an easy solution.  A new site has been identified beside the current Finn Valley sports centre which is a nationally renowned centre with a new swimming pool project under construction.  The centre also has a running track of European standard.  The proposed site across the road has planning permission and is being purchased by the Department.  All that is required is that the school project progresses to the capital programme. <\/p><p>Before my party left government the project had been placed on the capital programme.  I know that there are competing demands but there is no school in a similar position and St. Mary's deserves to be included.  Its omission means that I no longer know what school project deserves inclusion because this is an emergency case.  The project has been progressed so far.  I have been in written correspondence with officials in the Department.  To be fair to them, they responded and outlined the situation.  In the final paragraph of recent correspondence they outlined that the project could be included in the capital programme where funds are made available.  I call on the Minister this evening, but he may not have the answer but I plead with him, to consider including the project given its unique circumstances.  There are almost 500 children attending St. Mary's national school and they deserve to attend a school that is safe, fit for purpose, has running water and toilet facilities and where they are not in danger of being knocked down going to or leaving school.  That is what I seek.  This is a simple situation.  The project has been developed so all that is required is for funding to be provided over a period to build the project.  We live in an era where there is great value for money.  We can get value when building such a project because contractors are willing to offer a competitive price.  I hope that the Minister will give me good news this evening.  He is smiling and I shall take that as a good sign.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300020#T00800","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1366737600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I am familiar with the school.  Every by-election brings strangers to a constituency and one ends the campaign as an expert on every back alley and lane.  I know the school and church well.  I am glad for the Senator's illumination of the opportunity to build a decent school.  There is no question about the unsatisfactory nature of the existing school and I concur with everything that he has said.  I have received representations from other public representatives in Donegal about the school.<\/p><p>My problem, quite honestly, is the following.  We are blessed with a growing population.  However, I will not be blessed if the children born this morning are in four years' time looking into a field and not a school yard, even if it all is covered in concrete and littered with prefabs and substandard buildings.  I shall put on the record the related figures.  The pupil enrolment is currently about 515,000 in primary and 361,000 in secondary.  That figure, combined together, is expected to grow by 100,000 between 2012 and 2019.  In other words, an additional 70,000 pupils at primary level and another 30,000 pupils at post-primary level.  Enrolment will continue to rise at post-primary level up to the year 2024 at least.  I have heard what the Senator has said.<\/p><p>With regard to additional moneys in terms of the capital programme, buildings were taken off the capital programme, including this project, primarily due to analysis of the demographic growth of the area.  There was no dispute about the necessity for a replacement building.  If the population was static and in no way dynamic, or not exerting additional demand, then we had to reprioritise the school.  When I introduced the five-year capital programme the dominant criterion, and there was more than one, was population growth.  I will examine the case as requested by the Senator and I shall see where it is in that context.  I cannot give him any indication tonight.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300020#T00900","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1366737600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's response.

It is unfair to penalise a school simply because it has not got the standard of accommodation to attract new pupils and increase its numbers.  If a new school was built pupils would want to attend, given the nature of the adjacent sports facilities.  I understand where the Minister is coming from.  It may be simplistic but I plead with him to examine it again.  I am available to give him any assistance that he requires.

He will be aware that, unfortunately, Diageo has announced that it is ceasing its operations at the Waterford facility.  That news came as a shock to the workforce.  Some 35 direct and indirect jobs will go if this closure goes ahead.  It also came as a shock to the people of Waterford, a city with 25% unemployment, which is facing an unemployment crisis in a region with 19%.  We need to be creating jobs, not losing them.  Any announcement such as this one is bad news both for those being made redundant but also for the economy in the Waterford region.<\/p><p>The Diageo plant in Waterford produces the essence concentrate for Guinness which is exported around the world.  It is a top class, state-of-the-art  facility.  In 2004, the company invested &euro;40 million capital funding in its Waterford facility.  That was at a time when the company had downsized its operations in Waterford.  This was seen as its stake in the area to which it was committed, yet a short number of years later Diageo has decided to cease production despite the fact that &euro;40 million was put into the facility.  Less than &euro;1 million of that sum came from Enterprise Ireland but nonetheless it was a significant capital investment by the company.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to raise this matter with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  What steps have been taken by the Minister or his Department to safeguard jobs at the Waterford facility?  Has there been any dialogue or communication between the company, the Minister and his Department?  Has the company been asked to offer any rationale for its decision, given that it made such a big capital investment?  Can the Minister of State detail the total investment of public moneys which has been put into this site over many years?  Do any clawback clauses exist if the site is to be closed?<\/p><p>The trade union involved, SIPTU, is working hard to secure the jobs and is in discussions with the company.  We wish them all well and hope that the Minister and his Department will also become involved.  Hopefully that effort will be successful.  If it is not, however, and the company sticks to its plan to close the Waterford plant and move the operation to the St. James's Gate facility in Dublin, it is vital for Enterprise Ireland and the Department to consider some sort of replacement on that site in Waterford.  It is an iconic building at the entrance to Waterford city, containing a state-of-the-art facility that cannot be left unused.  It would be a travesty to abandon it.  We must find some sort of replacement industry that can retain jobs and keep production going in some shape or form, if Diageo cannot be convinced to keep the facility open.  For example, we could examine micro-brewing along with other options.<\/p><p>Is Enterprise Ireland alert to this matter?  Is it working with stakeholders or individuals who may have ideas on how to protect and maintain jobs?  I have raised this Adjournment matter to try to safeguard jobs.  We want to support SIPTU's efforts to protect the existing employment and hopefully change Diageo's mind.  If that does not prove possible, what steps can the Department and State agencies - especially Enterprise Ireland - take to ensure some level of continuing production and jobs on that site?  The building must not be left unused and vacant.  It must be utilised, so I appeal to the Minister of State to do what he can to make that a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300021#U00100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1366738200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Cullinane for raising this important matter.  The operations of the company referred to by the Senator have been under review for some time.  The company is expanding in St. James's Gate with a &euro;153 million investment which will secure the future of brewing in Ireland.  In this regard, &euro;16 million is being invested in concentrate technology.  While the expansion at St. James's Gate will have a spin-off effect of increasing barley purchases - all of which the company sources in Ireland, which I welcome - I was disappointed to hear of the proposed closure of the Waterford site at the end of this year with the possible loss of 21 jobs.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the anxiety that the proposed closure will create for the workers involved and their families, as well as for the local community.  As the Senator said, it is an iconic building in Waterford carrying on a traditional business.  It is important that the impact of the site's closure on employment in Waterford is minimised.  The State's enterprise agencies will make every effort to develop new employment opportunities for Waterford and to support the retention of existing jobs there.<\/p><p>While the decision on plant closure is a matter for the company, I understand that Enterprise Ireland is working with Diageo to find a replacement industry for the site.  It is important to work on that opportunity.  Clearly, while this is a real difficulty for Waterford, there could still be opportunities in this situation, such as micro-brewing to which the Senator referred.  In addition, other possibilities can be considered.  It is all about consultation between Diageo and Enterprise Ireland.  In this respect, I understand that a number of potential investments are being actively considered and I am hopeful that any new investment will safeguard employment at the site.  It is positive news that such investments are being considered.  <\/p><p>I note the commitment of Enterprise Ireland.  Last week, Enterprise Ireland announced the highest exports ever from Ireland of &euro;16 billion.  The agency is doing an extraordinary job and the potential for new opportunities is there, given that the Enterprise Ireland management team is talking to Diageo.   <\/p><p>The Government's top priority is to get Ireland working again.  The Action Plan for Jobs, published on 22 February, is the next step in the Government's plan to rebuild the economy and accelerate the transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, innovation and exports.  <\/p><p>This is all about innovation, enterprise and exports.  Ultimately, it is entirely Diageo's decision what to do but we must also consider community involvement in the region, along with the county enterprise board and local government.  As well as being part of the city's history, this iconic building presents an opportunity for Waterford and must be enshrined in the current discussions.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs, which contains 333 actions to be implemented this year by 16 Government Departments and 46 agencies, will build on the progress made in 2012.  It will continue to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove the barriers to employment creation across the economy.  Support will be given to every opportunity for expansion of any business idea.<\/p><p>These actions are additional to the 249 actions already implemented under Action Plan 2012, which have helped to support a net growth of almost 12,000 in private sector employment in the past year.<\/p><p>On foot of the job losses announced by TalkTalk in Waterford in September 2011, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, tasked agencies and stakeholders in the south-east region to come up with a set of actions to address the long-standing unemployment problem in Waterford and the region generally.<\/p><p>The specific recommendations contained in the south-east employment action plan, produced by Forf&aacute;s, are being progressed by a forum representing the agencies and key stakeholders in the region.  I strongly advise Senator Cullinane to participate in that forum, which is where this matter should be discussed.<\/p><p>I can assure the Senator that the full range of State supports will be deployed to support those Waterford workers at the appropriate time.  The company and unions concerned availed of the industrial relations machinery of the State in the context of the company's earlier decision to close the Kilkenny and Dundalk breweries.  The services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court will, of course, remain available to assist the parties if requested.<\/p><p>State agencies will continue to work closely with each other and with local interests to support an integrated approach to job creation in Waterford.  Enterprise Ireland's activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through continuing to work with established companies in its portfolio.  The agency is also supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally-traded services companies which are setting up high potential start-up companies.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland's approach in response to job losses is directed at assisting any relevant employees affected.  It seeks to enhance and facilitate the future employment prospects of the workforce concerned and to identify and support any individuals who wish to start their own business.<\/p> <p>In addition, anyone who has been made redundant or who is facing redundancy in Waterford and is interested in exploring options for setting up a business should contact the Waterford county and city enterprise boards for appropriate advice and assistance.  The boards are a valuable resource for those starting a new business.  In 2012, the boards funded a range of grant applications and softer supports such as training and mentoring of clients in the micro-enterprise sector.  These investments resulted in a net increase of 53 jobs in the Waterford area during the year.  IDA Ireland continues to actively promote Waterford for new investment and is actively engaged with its existing client base to encourage their transition to higher value activities and their continued commitment to Ireland.<\/p><p>Diageo Waterford received one grant package from Enterprise Ireland for capital equipment, totalling &euro;800,000, which was approved in 2002.  There is no grant liability and no clawback clause relating to this grant.<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, together with the activities being pursued by the State enterprise agencies in Waterford, will continue to support business investment and help to create employment opportunities both in Waterford city and the surrounding area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300021#U00200","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366738800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his lengthy and comprehensive response.

Basically, the request is that the Department replace a project that was serving this area up until the middle of last year.  There was a Howth-based project that was providing a service for Howth, Sutton, Baldoyle, Bayside and the surrounding areas but there were difficulties with that project.  Since it has closed, there is an enormous gap in services in the area, particularly in terms of prevention.  The proposal was put forward by the community council following a considerable amount of research done through the local schools and youth services as well as with parents and residents of the area, on the needs of the community in terms of drug and alcohol abuse prevention and diversion projects.  That research, which was submitted to the Department, showed clearly a gap in such services in that area.<\/p><p>The proposal was submitted in January.  Since then, the community council has been finding it very difficult to get a straight answer regarding what is happening with the proposal.  I wrote to the Department on behalf of the council and received a reply to the effect that the issue is a matter for the drugs task force.  However, the drugs task force has said that it has been given a very clear message from the Department that it is being funded on an existing services only basis for this year and that it cannot approve replacement projects.  It seems that this very worthwhile initiative, the need for which has been well established through research and analysis, may not be funded by the Government.  The community council has not been able to get a straight answer on this question.  Money was available in the past through a previous project.  Funding was allocated to this area but now it is being left without a service.  I appreciate that money is tight within the Department and that cuts have been necessary.  However, of all of the services that need to be protected, drug projects are one of the most important.  It takes so long to get the right services up an running in areas that have struggled for many years with drug misuse problems.  In that context, it is a shame that the budget in general is taking a hit and while it is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, it does reflect the broader priorities of Government.  All Ministers should ensure that this service area is supported.  The amount of money involved is relatively small in the greater scheme of things.  <\/p><p>I tabled this matter on the Adjournment in order to bring it to the attention of the Minister of State, who is already aware of the proposal.  I hope he can give me positive news today.  The community council, which carried out the research and submitted the proposal, is a very professional organisation and is representative of all of the community bodies in the broader community.  If any organisation is capable of getting a project like this off the ground and running it for a relatively small sum of money, it is the Howth Sutton Community Council.  I hope the Minister of State has had a chance to read the proposal and that he can give me a positive answer, rather than just saying that it is an issue for the drugs task force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300022#V00500","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1366738800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>On 7 January last, my Department received a proposal from the Howth Sutton Community Council for funding to establish a drugs and alcohol prevention project in south-east Fingal, which would serve communities in Baldoyle, Bayside, Sutton and Howth.  The council wishes to set up a project to address a gap in service provision, as outlined by the Senator, that has arisen as a result of the closure in June 2012 of a community-based drugs project serving the Howth Sutton peninsula.  Funding for the latter project was withdrawn by the HSE as a result of deficits in governance, financial control and accountability that emerged during an audit of the project.<\/p><p>The need for support within communities around prevention education for young people and support for families has been identified by Howth Sutton Community Council on the basis of findings from a strategic evaluation of projects conducted by Dublin north-east local drugs task force in late 2011.  This evaluation included the former project serving the Howth Sutton peninsula.  Supplementary research undertaken with local schools and community actors in late 2012 also informed the research findings.<\/p><p>The key recommendations arising from the research are that a project be developed in partnership with existing community and statutory agencies, which would work with schools, youth and family support groups to develop local strategies for substance misuse education and prevention.  The proposal envisages that the project would initially focus on prevention, education and family support, with expansion into client-case management to be undertaken in the medium term if resources become available.  The cost of the project, which would involve hiring a co-ordinator and a project worker, is estimated at &euro;79,000 per annum.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware drugs task forces play a key role in assessing the nature of the drug problem in their areas and co-ordinating action at local level so that there is a targeted response to the drug problem in local communities.  A total of &euro;29.951 million has been allocated to the drugs initiative in 2013, the majority of which contributes to the running of community-based drugs projects supported by local and regional drugs task forces.  This includes an allocation of &euro;988,234 to the Dublin north-east local drugs task force, LDTF, which has responsibility for tackling the drug problem in the south-east Fingal area.<\/p><p>It is a matter for each drugs task force to decide which projects to support based on agreed priorities for their area within the overall budget available to them.  The allocation to Dublin north-east LDTF was determined on the basis of the community-based drugs projects it recommended for funding in 2013.<\/p><p>I have been in contact with Howth Sutton Community Council and have advised it to submit the proposal to Dublin north-east LDTF for consideration.  I have indicated that my Department will consider the proposal if it has been recommended by the task force.  At this stage, the drugs task forces have been advised of their allocations for 2013.  The funding of any additional measures is contingent upon the resources which are available to me for the year.<\/p> <p> I wish to explain that to the House again.  I do not have a discretionary budget.  In general it is not a question of making an application to the Minister and for the Minister or departmental officials to review the project.  I can see that this is a project of merit and I agree there is a gap in this area.  I know the need that exists as the Senator has very carefully and persuasively outlined to the House.  However, I cannot deal with the matter unless it comes to me by way of a recommendation from the local drugs task force.  I have explained that to the local drugs task force and have also responded to Howth Sutton Community Council.  However, if we were to seek to identify funding - difficult as that would be - it would inevitably affect the funding that would then not be available for other activities because I have a limited amount of funding available.  While the Senator makes her case very well, there is a finite amount of funding.  I could certainly not reallocate for 2013 unless I took money from somewhere else.  We will need to see how matters are for 2014, but I also expect resources to be finite next year.  I regret that resources are so limited, particularly in this area where the need is so great.  However, we know why resources are limited and what has caused the overall financial situation the country faces.  I am trying to do my best, as are the local drugs task forces with the funding available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300022#V00600","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366739400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for acknowledging the merit of the proposal and that a gap exists.  While the Minister of State has advised it that it should make a proposal to the local drugs task force, at the same time the Department has clearly advised the local drugs task force not to recommend new projects.  My understanding is that it has been advised that its funding is only on the basis of existing services and there is no scope for others.  This project is purely a restoration and it is not looking for anything new.  The implicit suggestion is that if it wants to restore a project, it must cut other projects within the task force area.  Obviously that puts any local drugs task force in an impossible position because the needs across a wider area are so huge.  There have already been cuts in services so it puts it in an impossible position to suggest the only way to get approval is to cut other services in the area.<\/p><p>This is money that was taken out of the pot for the Dublin north-east area local drugs task force to be used nationally, so it is only fair that it should at least be back in the pot rather than be taken from other local services.  It is an impossible position for everybody involved.  It is a really worthwhile project, as the Minister of State has acknowledged.  At this stage we are almost half way through 2013 and I hope he will look at it again for next year.  If the Minister of State has time I invite him to meet some of the people involved and hear the case from them directly.  I know he has already acknowledged the merits of the project, but he might feel more strongly about it if he could see the professionalism of the people involved and the potential for the initiative if it could get off the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300023#W00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1366739400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I certainly would be amenable to meeting the people involved and seeing the project.

However, as the Senator has picked up correctly, we have said that the funding the local drugs task force has this year is its funding for this year.  Of course 2014 is a new year and everything will be considered afresh, but there will still be a finite amount of resources.  I know the history of what has happened here and I must have regard to that.  The local drugs task force has a new chairman and a new co-ordinator.  I am not saying anything about anyone who went before, but I think that is very helpful.  They are very well organised and are very good people.  We will do everything we can to assist but it is not a question of a dilatory approach on my part or that of the Department.

A large number of people were deemed to be living in unfinished estates and thereby got an exemption from last year's household charge.  These same people are now baffled as to why they are not included in the local property tax exemption list.  Many of them have a good case for feeling this way as in many cases the developer did not fully comply with the terms of the planning permission.  These people were bona fide purchasers of houses in the boom times and contributed handsomely to the Exchequer at that time.  They have now been let down and are living in estates which might be substantially complete but have residual problems.<\/p><p>People living in an estate in Craughwell, County Galway, made plans to move out because a sewage treatment plant had stopped working and there were other residual problems relating to the builders failure to build the estate.  Among a plethora of planning permission breaches by the developer, the final coat of tar was not applied and there was no proper demarcation of common areas.  This estate was developed in the early years of the boom.  I am baffled as to why the bond was not drawn down on time in order to ensure these works were completed.  The properties could have been taken in charge by the local authority.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance should outline the criteria being applied to unfinished estates in the calculation of the property tax.  Are the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners taking into consideration the underlying problems in an estate and not merely looking at outdated and obsolete valuations of properties?  Are they considering issues such as those affecting the estate I mentioned in Craughwell?  I hope they would apply a subjective valuation as a means of providing a just, fair and equitable system of property tax application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300023#W00500","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1366739400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  Section 10(2) of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides that a residential property shall be exempt from the local property tax, LPT, where it is situated in an unfinished housing estate.  Section 10(1) of the Act defines an unfinished housing estate as a development of two or more buildings that is specified in a list prescribed under section 10(3) of the Act by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the purposes of the Act.  Section 10(4) of the Act prescribes a range of circumstances to which that Minister shall have regard for the purposes of that section.<\/p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has recently prescribed and published this list, which is set out in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 and was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the national housing survey 2012.  The survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with local authorities and the housing agency.  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different from that used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the household charge.  That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development.  The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the state of completion of a development.  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &quot;seriously problematic condition&quot;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.<\/p><p>For the purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the LPT would apply, local authorities were asked by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to confirm or update the then existing list as appropriate.  The decision as to whether an estate is on the list of unfinished estates is in the ambit of local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and not in the ambit of the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>I understand the Senator is concerned about the criteria to be applied in the calculation of LPT for unfinished estates that are not on the list of unfinished estates published by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, that is, those which do not qualify for an exemption from LPT.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes.<\/p> <p> LPT is a self-assessed tax and it is a matter for the property owner, in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  While properties in a particular housing estate may not have qualified for an exemption from LPT on the grounds that the estate in question is not regarded as incomplete to a substantial extent, owners of residential properties in such estates should take all aspects that they consider relevant into account in arriving at an honest value for their properties.  Such factors would include the state of completion of roads, footpaths, lighting facilities, and water and sewerage facilities within the housing development concerned.  The charge to LPT is based on the chargeable value of the residential property and this is defined in the 2012 Act as the price that the unencumbered fee simple of a residential property might be expected to fetch in a sale on the open market were that property to be sold on the valuation date of 1 May 2013 in a manner that would secure the best possible price for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013042300023#W00600","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366740000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very detailed response.
