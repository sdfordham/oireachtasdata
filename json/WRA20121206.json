High Representative Ashton, on behalf of the EU, has also expressed her deep concern at the Israeli government&rsquo;s announcement in a statement issued on 2 December.  It is negative and highly damaging to any prospect of peace for Israel to announce this measure in response to an action at the United Nations which, while unwelcome to Israel, was an entirely legitimate political move, and one which was supported by the overwhelming majority of the nations of the world. The acceleration in the overall pace of settlement expansion is also deeply troubling with these settlement measures only the latest in a succession of major settlement announcements which have clearly been in planning for some time. <\/p><p>  It is also deeply troubling that, at a moment when the Palestinians were signalling that their success at the UN would permit them to re-enter direct negotiations with Israel, that the response of the Israeli Government should be such an action which directly threatens that prospect. It must be reiterated that not only is the entire settlement enterprise contrary to international law, but that the continued expansion of settlements is simply incompatible with the achievement of a comprehensive peace. It is very difficult therefore to do other than conclude that the Israeli Government is not genuinely committed to a negotiated peace deal, unless it moves at once to rescind these decisions.<\/p><p>  Following agreement on a concerted response at EU level, the Israeli Ambassador was invited in to my Department on 4 December and asked to convey to his Government our deep concern and disappointment at these decisions, and our view that they must be reversed. I understand that a number of EU partners have acted similarly. I expect to be further discussing this matter, and other recent developments, with my colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, 10 December.  In relation to settlement products, I have recently written to the Deputy and to all Deputies setting out in detail my views on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600072#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600072#WRA00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600072#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[54999\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600072#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the saving to the Exchequer that would accrue from including child benefit as taxable income.","asker":"977","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[54932\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600072#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the saving to the Exchequer that would accrue from including child benefit as taxable income; if the Revenue Commissioners have the capabilities to do if so directed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 9 together. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from taxing Child Benefit is fully dependent on resolving a number of significant and complex policy and legal issues before the question of implementing a charge to taxation on this payment can be considered. These policy issues include clearly determining who is the owner of the Child Benefit payment, whether by taxing the payment, there follows an entitlement to the PAYE tax credit, how the payment is treated for tax purposes in the hands of jointly assessed couples and legal issues surrounding the tax treatment of married couples and co-habiting couples. I understand that the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, established by the Minister for Social Protection, has considered these and other issues in relation to Child Benefit in the context of a report on child and family income supports which is being considered by the Minister. <\/p><p>  In view of the considerable legal and policy issues involved, it is extremely difficult to estimate the likely yield as a result of taxing Child Benefit. I am advised that the estimated full year yield, based on projected 2013 incomes, could be of the order of &euro;395 million on a 2012 basis, if the Child Benefit were fully taxable as the income of the assessable person in joint assessment cases, and that no new tax threshold, exemption, allowance or personal reliefs would be introduced to offset some of the tax.  <\/p><p>  Regarding the implementation of any decisions the Government might make, I am further informed that, were the legal and policy issues resolved and legislated for, there are very well established data exchange arrangements in place between Revenue and the Department of Social Protection that could be extended to facilitate the taxation of Child Benefit once there is a suitable lead-in time and resources to facilitate the ICT changes required by both the Department of Social Protection and Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600072#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[54824\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600072#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the different rates of tobacco duty for cigarettes and rolling tobacco; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Following yesterday&#8217;s Budget changes, the rate of tobacco products tax applicable to cigarettes is &#8364;237.69 per thousand together with an amount equal to 8.83 per cent of the price at which the cigarettes are sold by retail, or &#8364;271.91 per thousand cigarettes, whichever is the greater.

The second table attached provides a breakdown on a county basis of the number of appeals received to date by SUSI.<\/p><p>The waiting time for processing a student grant application by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) varies, depending on a number of factors including the volume of applications received at any given time, the complexity of the grant applicants circumstances, and time taken by the applicant to submit all the required documentary evidence to enable a final decision to be made on an application. Every effort is made to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications as soon as possible. Currently, SUSI has some 272 applications on hand which are awaiting provisional assessment - these are applications received after the closing date. The number of applications being processed has been increasing incrementally in recent weeks. SUSI has indicated that it is on target to progress all applications received to date with the necessary supporting documentation between now and the end of the year.<\/p><p>Appeals received by SUSI are dealt with in date order, and the waiting time for decisions on appeals can vary depending on the complexity of the grant applicants circumstances which are under appeal. SUSI aims to issue determinations on appeals as promptly as possible and within the specified timeframes defined in the Student Support Act, 2011. The county from which an appeal originates is not a factor which impacts on the waiting time for appeals.<\/p><p><pcenter><b>SUSI Applications - Processing Position by

In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, Minister Hayes signalled to the House his intention to bring proposals to Government on Committee Stage amendments dealing with issues that would include: <\/p><p>  Thresholds: In order to ensure that the legislation applies to the majority of Construction Contracts the scope of the legislation will be broadened by reducing or removing the current monetary thresholds contained in the Bill. <\/p><p>  Adjudication:  This issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors is a complex issue.  It is important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.<\/p><p>  When these and a number of other issues have been examined, Minister Hayes will bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage early in the New Year. This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600073#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600073#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[54988\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600073#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding local authorities and work contracts; when a local authority is in a position where they could actually carry out the works themselves, if his Department will allow that local authority to tender for the work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>The Local Authorities are subject to national procurement rules in the same manner as any other public body.

When I received the judgement, I quickly stated my aim was to ensure that an employer should not benefit from using an illegal contract of employment where he or she was a willing party to its creation. I repeated this assurance personally to the person concerned when I met him and a delegation from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and SIPTU.  The Deputy will note that the Government did not oppose Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill as it concurs with our objectives - to ensure that outcome of the High Court case will not arise again.<\/p><p>  The issue raised by the High Court judgement is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights. The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such workers should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. My Department has received preliminary legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General counselling that the judgement raises matters that are particularly complex. These matters are currently receiving priority attention with a view to identifying the best way in which the legislation may be amended.<\/p><p>  It is my firm intention to amend the Employment Permits legislation in a precise manner so as to ensure that an employer may not benefit from the illegality of the contract of employment where they are found culpable in not ensuring a valid employment permit was in place for the employee concerned.  To this end, I hope to be in a position to propose the necessary provisions in a new Employment Permits Bill, currently being drafted and which is anticipated to be introduced in the first quarter of next year. I believe that this would be the most appropriate method of dealing with such a technically specific matter. Decisions on the legal options will be made in light of further legal advice and in consultation with other Government departments. I can assure the Deputy that my Bill is a Government priority and I would expect a speedy passage through the Oireachtas after its introduction.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to stress that the judgement relates only to the consideration of the enforceability, or otherwise, of an employee&rsquo;s rights. It does not mean that unscrupulous employers can employ unauthorised third country nationals without running the risk of significant legal consequences. I would emphasise that an employer who engages in this type of activity is open to prosecution under the Employment Permits legislation and could be found guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both. Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Employment Rights Authority actively pursue breaches under the legislation and welcome information concerning possible breaches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600074#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600074#WRC00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600074#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[54856\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600074#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding training or work in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>The person concerned agreed a Personal Progression Plan with her case officer on 11th October 2012 in which many work and training opportunities were presented to her.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children.  Budget 2013 provides for a reduction in child benefit rates to &euro;130 per child per month for the first, second and third child in a family and to &euro;140 per child per month for the fourth and subsequent children. Although the gross savings is about &euro;136 million in 2013, some of these savings have been redirected towards services for children including after school childcare, an area based child poverty initiative and school meals which have the potential to improve outcomes for children generally.<\/p><p>  While child benefit is an important source of income for families, the social protection system also provides assistance to families with children through the payment of qualified child increases (QCIs) on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement (FIS) payment which both provide assistance which is linked with household income. Budget 2013 maintains both the QCI rate and the FIS income limit thresholds.<\/p><p>  While issues relating to changes in taxation policy are a matter for my colleague, Michael Noonan T.D., Minister for Finance, the taxation of child benefit would only address one of the main child income support payments and would not address the other child income support payments to low income families, which includes QCIs and FIS.  In this context the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare which I established last year was tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how income employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved. The Advisory Group&rsquo;s report on family and child income supports remains under my consideration and will assist in informing how reform in this area might be progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600074#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600074#WRC03450"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[55021\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600074#WRC03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 24th February 2012.

I would like to emphasise that the National Famine Commemoration is, and will remain, an inclusive event, which recognises the significant impact of the famine on all communities on the island of Ireland.  Indeed, in the context of the Deputy's Question, respected historians have pointed to the significant impact of the famine on Ulster as a whole.  The main objective of the National Famine Commemoration Committee is to ensure that all victims of the Great Irish Famine are remembered in a dignified manner and, as Chair of this Committee, I will seek to ensure that this work continues.  <\/p><p>  The National Famine Commemoration Committee has agreed that the annual national commemoration should revolve between the four provinces of Ireland.  The Deputy may be aware that the 2011 National Famine Commemoration was held in Ulster, in Clones, County Monaghan, at which President McAleese led the official representation.  Attendance at the National Famine Commemoration is wide-ranging and in this regard, members of the Legislative Assembly in Northern Ireland, as well as organisations and individuals both North and South of the border, were invited to attend.  In the two weeks leading up to the national event, the local community devised a programme of events which took place across Monaghan and Fermanagh.  In addition, schools, North and South, were invited to hold a minute's silence in honour of the victims of the famine.  <\/p><p>  Members of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly were also invited to attend the 2012 National Famine Commemoration in Drogheda, County Louth and, indeed, the Deputy First Minister was among those who attended, together with a number of Northern Ireland Ministers.  The 2015 National Famine Commemoration is due to take place in Ulster.  I and the officials in my Department will be working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Taoiseach and all relevant stakeholders, North and South, to ensure that this event will be a fitting tribute to those who perished in Ulster during the Great Famine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; Deontas","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[54958\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":" c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad deontas a ceada&iacute;odh do Chomhar Chuig&eacute;il &oacute; 2007 go d&aacute;ta, c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad deontas d&iacute;obh sin a &iacute;ocadh amach, c&eacute;n m&eacute;id den airgead a ceada&iacute;odh at&aacute; f&oacute;s gan tarraingt, c&eacute;ard a chaithfear a dh&eacute;anamh leis an airgead seo a fh&aacute;il; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.<\/p><p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides the main regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector and for the operation of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). The Act provides for minimum entitlements in relation to security of tenure based on four year tenancy cycles, known as a Part 4 tenancy. The Act also sets out the grounds for the termination of a Part 4 tenancy. However, the Act does not preclude a landlord giving rights to tenants in a tenancy agreement in addition to those provided for in the Act. Where additional security of tenure rights are given to a tenant in a tenancy agreement, the termination of those rights will depend on the terms of that agreement. The parties to a tenancy may refer any matter relating to the tenancy , in respect of which there is a dispute between them, to the PRTB for resolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRD02650"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[54993\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to increase the grants for group sewerage schemes; if there was any provision in budget 2013 to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>The rate of grant available for Group Sewerage Schemes is &euro;2,031.58 per house or 75% of the cost of the scheme, whichever is the lesser.

The Deputy may not be aware that the making of a deportation order against a person requires him or her to leave the State.

I can further inform the Deputy that the number of deportation orders revoked in each year in the period 2008 to end October 2012 was 25, 14, 21, 15 and 18 respectively.

Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the Direct Provision system.

During the same period, 757, 1,077, 1034, 1334 and 1,234 deportation orders were signed and a total of 161, 338 343, 280 and 246 persons have been removed from the State together with 529, 539 461, 475 and 387 who have voluntarily returned to their country of origin.  These figures do not include approximately 2,500 persons per annum who have been refused leave to land and are subsequently removed from the State. <\/i><\/p><p><i>  As outlined in my response to PQ Numbers 962, 968 and 971 of 18<\/i><i><sup>th<\/sup><\/i><i> April last, a total of 1,052, 512, 232, 1957 and 951 were granted leave to remain in accordance with the provisions of the immigration acts.

In addition, I am informed that a significant number of persons who are the subject of a Deportation Order will have left the jurisdiction.<\/i><\/p><p><i>The processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international law and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.   The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.  In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[54887\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which the Courts Service, as it embarks upon a detailed evaluation of the court venues at Achill, Ballyhaunis, Swinford and Westport, County Mayo, with a view to possible closures, has investigated the availability or otherwise of public transport to local persons in these rural areas which would impede on their ability to attend at a court venue outside their own locality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>As I have previously informed the Deputy, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of accommodation for court sittings.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  <\/p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  I can assure the Deputy that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.  The additional issues raised by the Deputy are being given consideration as part of the preparation of the legislation necessary to give effect to the establishment of the new agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[54823\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if further home help hours will be allocated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; if he will expedite a response as a matter of urgency","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Control Measures","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[54827\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason tar levels are not prominently displayed on rolling tobacco; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>The 2001 Tobacco Products Directive (2001\/37\/EC) relates to the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products in the EU.

While my Department has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis on this policy, the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health, advises that water fluoridation is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  <\/p><p>  Other countries which have water fluoridation schemes include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. Water fluoridation is less common in Europe, where fluoridated salt is often available as an alternative, although some populations are supplied with naturally fluoridated public water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG02350"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[54898\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Symphysiotomy Report","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG02550"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[54900\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600075#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a time frame for the publication of the Walsh Report; the reasons for the excessive delay in publication; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Professor Oonagh Walsh, independent researcher was commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer in my Department to draft a report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Report was conducted in two stages. The first stage is an independent academic research report, which is based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries.  The researcher experienced unforeseen difficulties in accessing information sources and as a result, submitted the first stage of the report behind schedule in late January 2012. The researcher informed my Department that this was due primarily to the challenges with accessing historical data from a time when records on the procedure were not routinely kept. The second stage in the research process, involved a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.  The researcher is currently finalising the report based on the consultation and it is also planned to have a peer review process.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  <\/p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  I can assure the Deputy that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.  The additional issues raised by the Deputy are being given consideration as part of the preparation of the legislation necessary to give effect to the establishment of the new agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600077#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600078#WRG00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600078#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[54823\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600078#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if further home help hours will be allocated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; if he will expedite a response as a matter of urgency","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600078#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Control Measures","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600078#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[54827\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120600078#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason tar levels are not prominently displayed on rolling tobacco; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>The 2001 Tobacco Products Directive (2001\/37\/EC) relates to the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products in the EU.
