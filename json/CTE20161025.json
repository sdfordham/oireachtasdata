He is accompanied by Mr. John Riordan, who is a deputy director of audit.  I am now dealing with the agenda.  No apologies have been recorded today.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings of 18 and 20 October 2016 agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise a point arising from the minutes.  We dealt with the Social Insurance Fund and the large issue of outstanding insolvency and redundancy payments last week when officials from the Department of Social Protection were before the committee.  I propose that we write to the Secretary General of the Department to get a breakdown of the companies or businesses that owe money to the Department and ascertain how many of them are still registered with the Companies Registration Office.  I accept there will be difficulties in the case of companies that have gone bust and no longer exist because it will be impossible to collect the funds.  I suggest we should seek the details of companies that are still trading after being restructured and are profitable, but owe money to the Exchequer in respect of statutory redundancy payments that have not been repaid.  We know we will not get the names of the individual companies but we want to get an analysis of the companies that are still alive and could possibly be pursued to get some of the almost &euro;500 million that is still outstanding.  We will send that letter and will get a reply back in due course.  I just wanted to raise that issue arising from the minutes.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence received.  This morning we received the opening statement from today's witnesses.  Is it agreed to note that?  Agreed.  With regard to correspondence from Accounting Officers, correspondence has been received from NAMA regarding the release of communications with Lazard on the loan sale process as requested by the committee.<\/p><p>We will consider the matter in a moment as part of the work programme because Lazard will attend soon.  <\/p><p> The next item of correspondence is 114B(i) and (ii), a letter received from Si&uacute;n N&iacute; Raghallaigh, chairperson of the board of TG4 regarding contract details of the director general as identified in the 2015 financial statements.  This issue appears to be resolved with a new director general in place in accordance with legislation.  Is it agreed to note it?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Item 115B is correspondence received from NAMA in follow up to a request for information.  It will be added to our folder on Project Eagle correspondence.  NAMA was here on 29 September.  We wrote to it the following week seeking correspondence and item 115B is the reply.  We sent NAMA a subsequent letter a week later for further information.  The reply will be received today and the members will get it when it is received during the course of the day. <\/p><p> The next item is 102C, an e-mail from Deputy David Cullinane enclosing correspondence from Nua Healthcare regarding concerns about public sector tendering for residential disability services.  We deferred the matter last week due to the absence of the Deputy.  Does he wish to comment?  No.  I propose that we write to the HSE on the matter and the Office of Government Procurement for a response, and come back to it when we get a reply.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next item is 116C, an e-mail from Ms Fay Buckle, clerk to the Welsh Public Accounts Committee, regarding the hosting of an inaugural public accounts network meeting on 10 June 2017.  If members are interested in attending, please contact the secretariat. <\/p><p> The next item is 117C, correspondence received from an individual regarding this committee's discussion on Caranua on the presentation of its accounts and governance questions.  The letter refers to comments made by the Comptroller and Auditor General but it is unclear to what the individual is referring.  I propose that we ask the Clerk to write to the individual to seek clarity.  We will come back to the matter.  We will consider Caranua as part of our work programme but we will not put a date on it.  I propose that we consider including it in our work programme.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The next item is 118C, correspondence received from Deputy Mick Wallace that includes documents released under freedom of information pertaining to NAMA's interactions with Lazard.  I appreciate the correspondence that he sent to us for our information.  Is it agreed to note it and include it in our files?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The next item is 119C, an e-mail received from Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran on behalf of Cerberus confirming attendance of representatives of Cerberus before the committee.  We have added them to the schedule and agreed the date of 17 November for Cerberus to attend here in public session.  Earlier, I mentioned that Lazard has agreed to attend as well and I will come to that when we discuss the work programme. <\/p><p> We have received a very considerable amount of documentation from the HSE on our hearings on sections 38 and 39 organisations.  With the committee's agreement, I will ask the Clerk to look at the correspondence before circulation.  It is very voluminous and we want to get it in a manner that will be helpful to us.  Following a little bit of work on it by the secretariat, it will be sent to us.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The next item is reports, statements and accounts of bodies received since the last meeting.  Members can see them on their screens.  Bord Bia has a clear audit account, Waterways has a clear audit account and the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, has a clear audit account.  <\/p><p> The next item is the Health Service Executive's patient private property accounts.  There is a statement here from the Comptroller and Auditor General that states, \"The statement of internal financial control discloses weaknesses in the HSE's control over the management of patient private property accounts and the steps taken by the HSE to resolve these\".  I  note that there appears to be a turnover of &euro;83 million, which is a big amount of funds.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General would like to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016102500002#D00200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477386000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The turnover on the account is quite sizeable because it represents, effectively, State pensions that are payable to persons in care, that are paid into the account, and then a deduction is made for their upkeep leaving them with a certain amount of their own funding.  The bulk of the funding is managed through a central account operated by the HSE but there are accounts separately,  if one likes.  They refer to it sometimes as pocket money accounts in the individual care centres and there are very many of those, possibly 100 or so care centres, where there are separate accounts.  In fact, for these particular financial statements, this is the first time the HSE has included a specific statement on internal financial control.  We did quite a considerable amount of additional work there to look at the controls.  The controls are being tightened up.

In that capacity I am responsible for the management of NAMA's residential development funding programme which is aimed at delivering on a commercial basis, through NAMA debtors and receivers, 20,000 new homes in Ireland in the period out to 2020.  Prior to this role, I held a number of senior positions in NAMA's asset recovery division, including the position of deputy head of asset recovery at the time of the Project Eagle loan sale.  As deputy head of asset recovery in 2014, I worked with the head of asset recovery and the wider NAMA cross-functional team which executed the transaction following the board's decision to initiate the sale of Project Eagle.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Michael Moriarty is head of asset recovery at NAMA.  At the time of the Project Eagle sale, Mr. Moriarty, like me, held the position of deputy head of asset recovery.  Mr. Moriarty and I and the teams we supervised were responsible for the case management of the Northern Ireland debtors, but Mr. Moriarty was not directly involved in the Project Eagle loan sales process.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Donal Rooney until recently held the position of chief financial officer, CFO, at NAMA.  Mr. Rooney resigned earlier this year to take up a role with another employer.  The involvement of the CFO division in Project Eagle was twofold.  The finance team in the CFO division provided routine baseline financial data on the portfolio which was included in various papers for the board.  The operations, systems, treasury and tax teams, which also sit within the CFO division, were involved in the cross-functional transaction team.<\/p> <p>  I am also joined by Mr. Alan Stewart who is and was at the time a senior divisional solicitor and a senior member of the legal team engaged in the Project Eagle transaction.  The legal team was involved in drafting and negotiating all transactions documents, the design and population of the legal section of the data room and dealing with legal due diligence queries.<\/p> <p>  Together with our external advisers, Lazard and Hogan Lovells, we were tasked with the detailed transaction execution work which followed the decision of the board to offer Project Eagle for sale in January 2014.<\/p> <p>  In 2011, NAMA procured European and US panels of loan sale advisers to be fully prepared to take advantage of deleveraging opportunities as they arose.  We anticipated that there would be opportunities for assembling and marketing single connection and multiple connection loan portfolios during NAMA's lifespan.<\/p> <p>  NAMA also formed an internal loan sales team with experience in corporate finance, accountancy, banking, property and law.  By the time of the Project Eagle sale, NAMA had completed a number of loan sales with total par debt of &euro;4 billion, and we were preparing for the sale of Project Tower.  We had also engaged with numerous international loan buyers as part of our strategy of developing a market for distressed property and loans in Ireland.  The purpose of this strategy was to attract investment into the Irish market at a time in 2012 and 2013 when there appeared to be little or no appetite for investment in Irish assets compared with what subsequently transpired during 2014 and 2015.<\/p> <p>  In 2013 and early 2014, the Irish loan sales market was at a very early stage of development.  The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, was placed into special liquidation in February 2013 and its loan books were the first large Irish portfolios to be brought to market.  From 2013, the market evolved significantly and quickly in a relatively short period.<\/p> <p>  NAMA has always sought to implement best practice in its loan sales in order to maximise value.  It continually makes changes to its processes to improve efficiency and to retain investor interest.  From 2014 onwards, there was a move by sellers to offer more vendor due diligence in an effort to reduce bidders' due diligence costs which for a large portfolio could be &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million.  This was a very significant outlay for unsuccessful bidders.<\/p> <p>  Since 2014, bidders have demanded access to a greater volume of information in loan sale data rooms.  However it is important to note that single phase data rooms are still in use and the concept of a two-tier data room like that used for Project Eagle remains commonplace.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to note there was, and is, no single correct way for NAMA or any other loan seller to market a loan portfolio.  Marketing approach depends on the size, value and granularity of the portfolio and the size of the potential investor pool.<\/p> <p>  Some sales are single phase and some are in two phases.  A two-phase marketing approach is generally used where there is a long list of potential buyers who have the financial capacity and credibility to be approached and that list needs to be substantially reduced before going into phase two.  In a two-phase process, the phase one data room has only very limited information and full due diligence is only provided to the short list of bidders, typically three final bidders who reach phase two.  By reference to the loan sale practice at the time, the data room for Project Eagle was appropriate for the portfolio.  As there was not a long list of potential buyers, a two-phase process was not appropriate.  Lazard identified nine potential buyers of which five decided to review the data in detail.  Accordingly, a single phase data room was set up so that the investors who sought access could get immediate access to full due diligence materials.  In the circumstances there was no need for a phase one data room.<\/p> <p>  Since the top 55 properties represented a significant proportion of the underlying value of the portfolio, we adopted a two-tier approach to vendor due diligence.<\/p><p>The legal section of the data room contained a vendor due diligence report and copies of loan, security and title documentation for each of the top 55 assets and also included all of their anchor leases.  The commercial section of the data room contained redacted November 2009 red book valuations and up-to-date tenancy schedules for the top 55 assets.  This provided the bidders with all the cash flow information necessary to make their assessment of value.  Extensive data tapes or schedules of information were also provided along with registers of receiverships, litigation and bankruptcies.  For the smaller assets, the legal section of the data room contained a vendor due diligence report on each connection which set out details of the loans, security and guarantees.  The commercial section of the data room contained November 2009 red book valuations for the smaller assets.<\/p><p> It has been suggested that some potential investors were discouraged from participating in the Project Eagle process because PIMCO had a head start.  That does not reflect our experience, generally or by reference to Project Eagle.  Loan sales are frequently initiated as a result of an unsolicited third party approach known as a reverse inquiry.  In fact, over 50% of our significant loan sales were initiated following credible reverse inquiries.  In assessing such approaches, our key consideration is whether the proposed transaction optimises the financial return to NAMA.  If it does, and if NAMA believes that the party making the reverse inquiry has the financial capacity to deliver on it, we will prepare a formal assessment and seek a decision to initiate a formal loan sales process.<\/p><p> To date, of those significant loan sales triggered by credible reverse inquiries, only about a third have been won by the party that made the original reverse inquiry.  This is strong evidence that PIMCO had no advantage over the other potential bidders.  Following its expression of interest in September 2013, PIMCO was given access only to the redacted 2009 red book valuations for the top 55 assets and some information regarding portfolio cash flows.  More limited information was provided about the smaller assets and no legal documentation of any type was provided to PIMCO.<\/p><p> The letter of offer from PIMCO, submitted on 4 December 2013, was based on its evaluation of the material provided on the top 55 assets.  Following the board&rsquo;s decision to market the portfolio, a single-phase data room was opened in February 2014 and six potential bidders signed non-disclosure agreements permitting them access.  As is normal in loan sales, documents were uploaded to the data room throughout the process.  The six potential bidders admitted to the data room were PIMCO, Oaktree, Cerberus, Lone Star, Goldman Sachs and Fortress.  The only distinction between PIMCO and the other five bidders in the data room was that PIMCO had already seen November 2009 redacted red book valuation reports for the top 55 properties in late 2013.  We do not consider that to have been a material advantage.<\/p><p> The committee has already heard from the chairman and CEO that, following the board&rsquo;s decision to market the portfolio, Lazard was appointed in January 2014 as the loan sale broker to identify all other credible bidders for the portfolio and to advise on and manage the sales process through to completion.  Lazard&rsquo;s role involved designing the bid process, initiating engagement with potential credible bidders, managing the due diligence query process in conjunction with legal advisers, engaging with bidders throughout the process, leading the commercial negotiations and managing the sale execution.<\/p><p> The identification of other credible bidders and the sequence for engaging with those bidders was based on Lazard&rsquo;s assessment of the loan sales market and we relied on its advice in that respect.  Lazard identified a bidder list and then engaged with potential credible bidders to ascertain their level of interest in the portfolio.  Based on detailed bidder engagement, Lazard confirmed to NAMA that all potentially credible bidders were given the opportunity to participate in the sales process.<\/p><p> Lazard worked with NAMA and our external legal advisers to design and populate the commercial and legal sections of the data room and decide on the detailed process.  Lazard engaged intensively with bidders throughout the due diligence query process.  Final bids were received on 1 April 2014 and Lazard evaluated the bids received from Fortress and Cerberus and recommended the latter&rsquo;s bid to the board.  Lazard confirmed to the board that there was sufficient competitive tension in the process until the receipt of the bids, and that the process was appropriate for a transaction of its nature.<\/p><p> Based on Lazard&rsquo;s advice, we recommended to the NAMA board that it accept the bid from Cerberus to achieve a combined &pound;1.322 billion for Project Eagle.  Lazard&rsquo;s role in this sale was similar to the role played by loan sale brokers in other NAMA sales.  A copy of the Lazard contract has been provided to the committee and it gives it a sense of the range of responsibilities involved.  In summary, Lazard was engaged to advise on the overall strategy, timing and tactics of the sale; identify prospective purchasers; advise on the data room and process letter; engage in direct discussions with purchasers - Lazard provided ongoing updates to NAMA on its engagement with prospective purchasers through weekly conference calls, update e-mails and formal reports; manage the ongoing sales process; assess submitted bids; make a final recommendation to NAMA; and manage the close-out of the process from the selection of the preferred bidder.<\/p><p> It has also been commented upon that Lazard did not have total control of the data room as loan sale advisers tend to do in most loan sales.  That is a technical point and is not material to how the process was managed.  Data room set-up varies from transaction to transaction.  Data rooms are typically provided by an external specialist company, such as Intralinks, with substantial IT security and tracking features.  NAMA and its legal advisers uploaded all the documentation to an Intralinks secure site.  Only the bidders who had executed the non-disclosure agreement, and their advisers, could access the secure data room.  Lazard had the same access rights as NAMA and maintained full oversight of all data room activity throughout the sales process.<\/p><p> Hogan Lovells was appointed as lead legal adviser for the transaction.  Hogan Lovells provided legal advice, project management and transaction management to NAMA in respect of the Project Eagle sale, and provided advice on all strategic legal issues that arose during the process.  Specifically, Hogan Lovells&rsquo;s role included the following: legal advice on all aspects of the transaction; design, collation and population of the legal data room; preparation of vendor due diligence reports; drafting and negotiation of all transaction documentation; co-ordination of all legal due diligence queries and responses; project management of the legal process across all jurisdictions; and post-completion delivery of documentation and transfers of security.<\/p><p> NAMA&rsquo;s engagement with Northern Ireland debtors had been difficult.  Progress on sales had been poor, as only &pound;112 million of Northern Ireland asset sales and loan redemptions had been achieved between 2010 and 2013.  While the enforcement rate, 39%, was the same as for the overall portfolio, it was clear that, if Project Eagle did not go ahead, there were a number of probable additional enforcements in the pipeline.  This is supported by an analysis of the credit grading profile of our loan book.  NAMA assigned a risk rating to each debtor connection on a credit grading matrix based on certain criteria.  The key criteria were mainly based on, first, the projected financial outcome or level of recovery of our debt; and, second, the overall level of co-operation, largely measured by debtor performance in meeting milestones.<\/p><p> Comparing the levels of co-operation by debtors within the Project Eagle portfolio with the rest of the NAMA portfolio, just 15% of Project Eagle debtors were graded as co-operating, compared with 28% on the rest of the NAMA portfolio.  Also, based on the limited number of sales achieved, falling asset values and increasing impairments, the percentage of Project Eagle debtors which attracted a credit grading of either 3B or 3C was 76%.  These are the lowest debtor credit gradings in NAMA&rsquo;s risk matrix.  These gradings relate to debtors whose case managers projected the worst financial outcome and, by definition, those that were projecting a loss greater than 20% below original expected recovery targets.  In addition, debtors with these gradings also displayed evidence of significant milestone slippage including missed sales, assets not being pledged to NAMA, difficulty in supplying documentation, etc.  This 76% credit grading for Northern Ireland debtors compares with just 36% for the rest of the NAMA portfolio and clearly demonstrates the scale of the challenge we were facing with these debtors.<\/p><p> I wish to comment briefly on the issue of the fair value of the Project Eagle portfolio as of the end of 2013.  The gross cash flows arising from the Project Eagle loans aggregated to &pound;1,675 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report has discounted these cash flows at a discount rate of 5.5% and has produced a net present value, NPV, of &pound;1,489 million.<\/p><p>However, it should be pointed out that this is not in line with the fair value methodology that was used in preparing information required as part of NAMA's financial statements for the end of 2012 and the end of 2013, both of which were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The fair value methodology for the 2012 accounts agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General was based on a discount rate of 10% and, had this fair value discount rate been applied to the Project Eagle portfolio, the net present value, NPV, would have been &pound;1.365 billion.  This was the prevailing fair value discount rate that applied at the time that the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio was being considered by NAMA in quarter four of 2013. <\/p><p> The fair value methodology adopted in the 2013 accounts involved the application of a discount rate of 5.5% for cash flows arising in the period 2014 to 2016 and a rate of 10% for cash flows arising during the period from 2017 to 2020, the blended portfolio rate.  However, the blended portfolio fair value rate would not, in our view, have been appropriate for the Project Eagle loans given the particular characteristics of that portfolio.  The Project Eagle portfolio carried higher risk and would therefore have warranted a discount rate higher than the blended portfolio rate and indeed, higher than the 10% fair value rate used in 2012 in order to derive its fair value.<\/p><p> When PIMCO expressed an interest in this portfolio, the board instructed the executive to assess the opportunity.  Following detailed assessment, the board took the view that the assets securing the Project Eagle loan portfolio did not have sufficient upside potential to justify a hold strategy and if NAMA could, in effect, lock down the value of the portfolio upfront by selling it in 2014, that would be the optimum commercial outcome.  The NAMA executives supported that view and remain convinced that the decision to sell and the method of execution were appropriate and that the price achieved was the best available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016102500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Collison","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1477386000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collison.

Then there was a follow on meeting which took place towards the end of October.  Again, PIMCO was re-confirming that it was very interested in proceeding.  It wanted to progress the sale on the basis of exclusivity.  PIMCO was proposing that it would be an off-market transaction which we told them, right from the start, we would have difficulties with and that our policy was to openly market.  There certainly were two meetings that I attended with PIMCO at that time.  There would have been further engagement with the company by e-mail thereafter.

I cannot say exactly that we would have shared that view.  We found it a very difficult market, a very small concentrated market.  I also certainly got the impression from PIMCO at the time that they were going to provide some capital expenditure, so they were going to invest in these assets.

I was at a number of the initial meetings with the parties that were invited into the process, and on at least probably three occasions the investors said they were living with short timeframes and with limited representations and warranties being provided as part of a loan sale process.

That was part of the evolving market that we mentioned.  It was also another context, in that we were keen to progress.  We were facing the prospect of - and spending a lot of money preparing to do so - taking on another large amount of loans if the liquidators did not sell them.  It was only in April 2014 that the Minister was able to tell us that we did not need to take on the loans because the liquidators had successfully sold them and repaid NAMA's debt.

The board had set a target that, by the end of 2014, NAMA would have redeemed 50% of the original bonds, which was quite a step up.

They have simply zoned in again on the figures of 5.5% and 10% and said once again that the Comptroller and Auditor General had inappropriately used a figure.  I am exasperated at this point because he will be coming back in due course to answer but from what we have read, he did not pick the figure of 5.5% out of the sky.  He picked it from the NAMA board and minutes and has made comments and drawn conclusions that NAMA did not justify its decisions, did not show evidence for its decisions, did not back them up and did not look at alternatives.  I will not waste my five or ten minutes going through all of that again but I have put it repeatedly to the different NAMA witnesses.  I would have thought that at this point, if they were coming in with ten pages, they might go through chapters 3 and 4 and deal with what the Comptroller and Auditor General raised - the Project Eagle loan sale process, the other chapter concerning the basis for the decision for the decision to sell the Northern Ireland debtor loans and the conflict of interest.  They are three major areas.  I would have expected the witnesses to go through all of that.  They have had five draft reports.  They have had ample opportunity and we are now at the end of the October and I do not see any of the concerns raised.<\/p> <p>  I will use my time to concentrate on the conflict of interest.

Is it possible that NAMA was not as diligent and strong in marshalling its debtors in Northern Ireland as it might have been with debtors down here?

First, we quoted the rate of enforcement on the Project Eagle portfolio at 39%, which is quite similar to the rate for the rest of the NAMA portfolio.  If NAMA had not concluded the sale of Project Eagle, that percentage would have increased pretty substantially.  I can think of at least three substantial enough connections that were being considered for enforcement in the run-up to Project Eagle.  They were certainly heading in that direction.<\/p> <p>  There were 17 debtor connections out of the 55 in the Project Eagle portfolio that had absolutely no sales whatsoever recorded in the period 2010 to 2013.  They had not generated one sale.  That stood out completely against the rest of the NAMA portfolio.  If one were to ask why the enforcement rate had not increased above and beyond the rate associated with the rest of the portfolio, I would contend some of these connections were later acquisitions.  We took them in at a later point, maybe a few months later than some of the other connections that NAMA was dealing with.  By the time we actually evaluated their strategies, we would have assessed all their business plans and put in place a strategy we felt might work.  We were probably a few months behind some of the other connections we were dealing with down here.  It was partly a timing issue, probably.  If Project Eagle had happened a year later, I believe the enforcement rate would have been a lot higher but I can assure the committee that we have a monthly review of all connections in NAMA, on which we report to our CEO.  Mr. McDonagh would be able to confirm this.  From looking back over our records of some of those engagements at the time, I believe there was a history across the Project Eagle portfolio of failed milestones, difficult negotiations and debtors just not co-operating.  I am not saying for a minute that we did not have difficulties with the debtors down here because we did.  As a particular portfolio, however, this was an extremely difficult one to manage.

Very quickly, I want to come back to the first issue I raised earlier about the discount rates.  I seek clarification from Mr. Collison.  We received documents on the discount rates but they are not what we were looking for.  Mr. Collison spoke earlier about documents that were floating around that were very specific to Project Eagle and the particular characteristics he spoke about in his opening statement about the higher risk involved that warranted a discount rate higher than the blended portfolio and so on.  They do not seem to be in the notice that we received, or that I received.  If Mr. Collison could float whatever notes are floating around in our direction, it would be very useful because we do not have them yet.<\/p> <p>  I seek clarification on one thing.  In Mr. Collison's opening statement, he said, \"The fair value methodology adopted in the 2013 accounts involved the application of a discount rate of 5.5% for cash flows arising in the period 2014 to 2016 and a rate of 10% for cash flows arising during the period from 2017 to 2020\".  We discussed this earlier.  He put a lot of stock in this in criticising the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The head of NAMA was also quite critical of the lack of what he called \"market experience\" within the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General as well.  Essentially, Mr. Collison is falling back on the 2012 and 2013 accounts and is saying that this was to do with fair value projections, calculations and methodology, which is actually market value.  Mr. Collison said that the fair value methodology for 2013 was a 5.5% discount for cashflows between 2014 and 2016 and a 10% discount from 2017 to 2020.  That was not applied in the case of Project Eagle.

It was offered the opportunity to leave the process ... If it refused, it would have to be forced out... It could not stay in the process.  <\/blockquote> <p>There is nothing in any of these recordings, or minutes, that would concur with that.  Let me give Mr. Stewart some examples.  I know he dealt with this with an Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, but I was not satisfied.  On the same page, on record 3, it states, &quot;[Tom Rice] TR said they did not want to continue in a process with any degree of impropriety for Pimco or NAMA and that Pimco was willing to withdraw completely.&quot;  It continues, &quot;[Ronnie Hanna] asked whether Pimco considered other options.&quot;  Mr. Stewart then justified that by saying there was a previous call the day before and there would have been some discussion about this.  Then the record states, &quot;TR asked what options [that Ronnie Hannah was talking about] and [Ronnie Hannah] asked if it could be shaped differently for the arrangement fee to come out.&quot;  <\/p><p>That does not sit with what Mr. Soffe said, which was that PIMCO had to go, that it was offered the opportunity to leave the process, and that, if it refused, it would have to go.  Nowhere in any of these minutes that Mr. Stewart took does it suggest that PIMCO was forced out.  It certainly does not confirm what was in the minutes, where they seem to want to acquiesce.<\/p><p>This was referred to by Mr. McEnery where he said: &quot;Following the recent disclosure by PIMCO Legal and Compliance units of the existence of a success fee sharing arrangement ... NAMA's acquiescence [was sought by PIMCO] to this which NAMA had not acceded to.&quot;  He went on to state, &quot;PIMCO said it had these arrangements and asked if NAMA would acquiesce but NAMA said &quot;no&quot;.&quot;<\/p><p>From Mr. Stewart's legal perspective, because this is very serious for PIMCO, would it be fair to say that PIMCO acquiesced to staying in the process despite the existence of the success fee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016102500002#DD00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477386000,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I think the question is whether it sought our acquiescence to stay in the process.

In response to a question from the board, it was noted that - notwithstanding the premeditated fee-sharing arrangement that had been put in place by PIMCO - the catalyst for disclosure of the arrangement to NAMA was allegedly the insistence of PIMCO's legal and compliance department.  I assume from the minute that it was Mr. Hanna presenting the information and Mr. Hanna fielding questions from the board.  The astonishing thing is that at the tail end of these phone calls, the approach having been made by NAMA, it was making it absolutely clear it was prepared to walk and it was deeply concerned.  It was not seeking acquiescence, as we have established.  At this point, Mr. Hanna reports to the board and it is faithfully recorded, allegedly at the insistence of PIMCO's legal and compliance department.

I am sure the Department will enjoy with it the same positive relationship that it had with the previous committee.<\/p> <p>  It might be timely to mention our new statement of strategy which we are finalising.  The requirement for a new statement follows on from the formation of the new Government.  The statement has been the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders and staff and will be submitted soon to the committee, as well as the Civil Service Management Board, CSMB, and the Department of the Taoiseach.  The new statement also follows on from an internal organisational review which we conducted during the past year.  Teams of departmental staff and senior management looked at the organisation's strengths and weaknesses on strategy, operations and staff development.  It was a forward looking exercise which produced a useful and practical plan for change in the Department, which we are implementing.  The review was carried out entirely by our own staff, without recourse to external consultants.<\/p> <p>  The Department is a complex organisation with a wide brief covering the development and regulation of agriculture, the food and drinks industry, forestry, fishing and aquaculture.  It has almost 3,000 staff and 12 agencies under its aegis.  It has five main business areas: food safety, animal and plant health, in which area approximately half of the staff are engaged; farm supports and controls - this area includes all of the big payment schemes; strategy and policy co-ordination; seafood; and corporate development.<\/p> <p>  The Department works closely with stakeholders on policy and operational issues.  Food Wise 2025, our latest ten-year strategy for the sector, the 400 plus recommendations of which guide many of our actions, was drawn up on this basis, as was our forestry programme and Harnessing our Ocean Wealth.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, chairs the Food Wise high level implementation committee, HLIC, in which the CEOs of the main State agencies and I participate.  This mechanism ensures joined-up State actions around the Food Wise priorities, as well as providing a platform for interaction with key stakeholders.  Of course, we also operate in close collaboration with other Departments, particularly in implementing the programme for Government which contains approximately 100 commitments of direct relevance to the Department.<\/p> <p>  Our work priorities for 2016 reflect the scale and breadth of our responsibilities, are published on our website and have been circulated to the committee.  For the sake of brevity, I will mention just a few key areas, but I underline the importance we attach to our many responsibilities.  I will touch, in particular, on Brexit; developments in key commodity markets; climate change; animal health; farm supports, both direct payments and RDP measures, and seafood development.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit, the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union presents enormous challenges for the Irish agrifood sector.  The main areas in which impacts are foreseen are currency fluctuations which have been quite dramatic, tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification.  The UK exit vote also raises complex issues for the fisheries sector.  Significant challenges are also foreseen from a North-South perspective.<\/p> <p>  My Department is engaged in detailed contingency planning and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking by way of an immediate response to the United Kingdom's decision, as well as feeding into the central contingency framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.  We are also continuing to deepen our own analysis of the likely impacts.<\/p> <p>  Among the early steps we took were the establishment of a Brexit unit within the Department, the convening of a consultative committee of stakeholders and the establishment of a contact group among the State agencies under the auspices of the Food Wise high level committee.<\/p><p>The Department is participating fully in the new sectoral work groups established under the auspices of the interdepartmental group on Brexit and chairs a specific agrifood subgroup.  There are ongoing contacts between the Irish, Northern Irish and UK administrations at political and official levels.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, had a discussion with the Northern Ireland Minister, Michelle McIlveen, at the North-South ministerial summit in July.  Senior officials have met on a number of occasions since then and are currently putting together a joint work programme.  Contact with the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is well under way at senior official level, with two meetings in recent weeks.  The Department is also working closely with Ireland's EU partners.  We are conscious of the fact that while we seek to continue our close relationship with our UK colleagues during this challenging process, we will be on the other side of the negotiating table as a continuing member state of the EU.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2017 financially underpins the Department's Brexit mitigation efforts through strategic investment in key areas of the Department, its agencies and the agrifood sector.  This includes access to an innovative low-interest cashflow loan fund, agri-taxation measures designed to address income fluctuations, increased funding of Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, investment in research and development and innovation and increased expenditure on the rural development and seafood development programmes.  The Department and Bord Bia are continuing their efforts to support companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to cope with the fallout from Brexit and the fall in sterling by providing advice at Bord Bia seminars, opening new markets and engaging in market promotion in the UK and alternative markets.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, led a successful trade mission to China, Vietnam, Singapore and Korea in September.  A further mission to Algeria and Morocco will be undertaken next month.<br\/><br\/>Some agricultural markets, notably in the dairy, pigmeat and fruit and vegetables sectors, had been experiencing difficulties for almost two years prior to the impact of the fall in sterling being felt.  This was due to a combination of increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU agrifood products and fluctuating global demand for dairy products in places, for example, such as in China.  The Minister and the Department have sought action at EU level.  The Commission has responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures under the Common Agricultural Policy, first in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner and subsequently in the form of two wider packages in September 2015 and March 2016.  The main elements of these packages have included the extension and broadening of more traditional support measures, such as intervention and aid to private storage.  In addition, more flexible and targeted direct aid has been allocated to member states to spend in accordance with their national circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in July.  The main component is a fund of &euro;500 million, which consists of two elements.  The first element of this fund is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure that will compensate farmers at a rate of 14 cent per kilogram for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.  Some 4,500 Irish suppliers who produce over 70 million litres applied for the first tranche of the scheme and 500 suppliers applied for the second phase this week.  The second &euro;350 million element of the package includes an allocation per member state, with Ireland receiving &euro;11.1 million.  In budget 2017, the Minister, Deputy Creed, announced a new low-cost loan fund for the livestock, tillage and horticulture sectors, which will utilise this allocation in conjunction with national funds to leverage &euro;150 million of low-cost loans for farmers.  These flexible loans of up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000 at an interest rate of 2.95%, are available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  While there has been some welcome recovery in dairy market prices, we continue to be vigilant.  Beef prices have been negatively affected recently by seasonal factors and the fall in sterling.  The opening of the Turkish market for live exports is providing some useful support to demand.  This underlines the importance of diversification of markets, which we will continue to emphasise in our work.  The emphasis in the tillage sector will be on efficient production, added value and the value of native grain.<br\/><br\/>Climate change has been a major area of policy work in the Department in recent years and this has intensified recently.  Ensuring food security for all and preventing climate change are two of the biggest challenges facing mankind today.  This was acknowledged by global leaders in last year&rsquo;s Paris agreement and highlighted within the sustainable development goals.  While Ireland is one of the world's most efficient food producers in terms of carbon footprint per unit of output, there is no room for complacency.  The Irish agriculture sector reduced emissions by 13% between 1998 and 2014, but it still accounts for approximately 33% of Irish greenhouse gas emissions.  It is predicted that Ireland will fall short of its emissions target for 2020.  All sectors will face significant challenges in meeting the national targets that are being negotiated under the EU climate and energy framework to 2030.  The Minister and the Department are deeply engaged with this process because of its importance for the sector.  In support of our national policy, we are undertaking a range of actions, including subsiding our afforestation programme, promoting best practice through new knowledge transfer groups, carbon-footprinting individual farms through the origin green programme, implementing the cutting-edge beef genomics scheme, supporting emissions reduction through the green low-carbon agri-environment and targeted agricultural modernisation schemes and promoting the carbon navigator tool through several channels.  We are far ahead of all, or almost all, other countries in this regard.  However, we are also much more exposed because the structure of our economy means that agriculture plays a much bigger role in our national emissions.  Climate change, water quality, which is a very important issue, and biodiversity will continue to be priority areas for agricultural policy and action by the Government, farmers and processors in the years ahead.<br\/><br\/>The Minister, Deputy Creed, launched a consultation process on the national farmed animal health strategy for Ireland, which is a new animal health initiative, last month.  It is vitally important for the agrifood industry, public health and animal welfare, as well as in the interests of protecting the environment, that we have a robust animal health strategy in place.  The draft strategy proposes a comprehensive set of actions for execution by stakeholders.  I will not attempt to summarise those actions here.  The main thrust of the strategy is to establish a comprehensive and co-ordinated plan for collective action by all stakeholders to support and sustain animal health, and to avoid losses or risks rather than being reactive to negative events.  In essence, it can be summed up in a pithy but well-known phrase, &quot;prevention is better than cure&quot;.  We have asked for submissions on the draft strategy by the end of this month.  It is planned to finalise and launch the strategy by the end of the year.We would welcome an input from the joint committee to the development of this strategy.<br\/><br\/>While I am on the subject of animal health, I must mention briefly our work on bovine TB.  The herd incidence of TB has declined from 5.9% in 2008 to 3.06% as of 10 October last.  Obviously, that figure could change by the end of the year.  The quality control measures that have been introduced, including interferon gamma blood testing, have had a significant impact on disease levels through earlier removal of reactors.  The significant reduction can also be attributed to the wildlife and badger removal programme.  At the same time, Animal Health Ireland is working on production or non-regulated diseases which affect farming productivity but are not significant from a public health perspective.  It is concentrating on a number of key programmes relating to bovine viral diarrhoea, Johne's disease, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, beef health check and mastitis.  The bovine viral diarrhoea eradication programme, which is led by the industry, has already resulted in a 75% reduction in the incidence of the disease.  This has led to an annual estimated return to farmers of &euro;66 million.  Animal Health Ireland has a vital role to play in enabling Irish farmers to access best international practice in achieving high standards of animal health.<br\/><br\/>A robust animal identification and traceability system is essential in the protection of animal and human health.  Bovine tagging is an important part of that system.  Following representations from interested parties, the Department decided last July to move from a single supplier system for the supply of ear tags, based on a competitive tender process, to a tag approval system whereby multiple suppliers would be approved.  Under the new arrangements, the tags will be objectively assessed for compliance with certain standards.  This is ongoing and I hope it will reach a conclusion in the next few days.  The current rules regarding the tagging and recording of sheep are widely acknowledged as being unduly complex.  The system is very labour-intensive at farm and factory levels.  Its considerable reliance on manual recording significantly increases the potential for errors.  This has the potential to undermine consumer confidence and puts Ireland at a marketing disadvantage.  The limited additional costs that would be imposed on farmers by the electronic identification of sheep would be very small relative to the &euro;25 million sheep welfare scheme that was announced recently.  Such a system would have a major advantage for farmers as it would significantly reduce the administrative burden relating to form-filling for sheep movements.  Therefore, the Minister has decided to initiate a consultation process on electronic identification of sheep.  This will commence in the near future.<\/p><p>Again, we would welcome the committee's input on this issue.<\/p><p> Turning to direct payments, the Department continues to prioritise the processing of applications for schemes such as the basic payments scheme and the areas of natural constraints scheme.  To date in 2016, some &euro;914 million has been paid to farmers under these schemes and pay-runs continue on a regular basis to ensure cases are paid once they are cleared.  The increase in online basic payment scheme applications this year to over 100,000 has helped the Department to introduce further efficiencies into the processing of payments.  For example, this year saw the introduction of preliminary checks for online basic payment scheme applicants which allowed certain types of errors to be rectified by applicants in advance of any possible penalty being applied.  As the Department moves towards 100% online application in 2018, further efficiencies will accrue which will have direct benefits for farmers.  Last year there were some problems with long delays for farmers and advisers in getting through on the phone to the Department on payment queries.  They arose principally due to staff shortages and the pressure of implementing new CAP schemes.  We have put in place new systems this year that are designed to deal with this and a significant improvement in service is already apparent. <\/p><p> Turning to rural development, in May last year we received EU approval for our &euro;4 billion co-funded rural development programme and since then the Department has successfully rolled out an impressive range of schemes under the programme.  It has been underpinned by the introduction of tailored on-line applications systems.  The rural development programme measures are a key component in our overall strategy for enhancing the competitiveness of the sector and achieving more sustainable management of our natural resources. <\/p><p> I will mention just a few of the schemes under the rural development programme, although I will not go through all of the bullet points in my written submission to save time.  On the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the committee will be aware that we now have a total of 38,000 farmers in the scheme and a third tranche will open next year.  Some of the commitments under the scheme are set out under the second bullet point in my written submission, including the protection of protection of 12,000 km of watercourses and preservation of 90,000 hectares of habitat and so on.<\/p><p> The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, consists of a suite of six measures, as set out in my written submission.  The scheme has been opened in three month tranches with the fifth tranche due to close in mid-January 2017.  To date, 8,900 applications have been received.  More than 5,000 applications were received in the first two tranches of the scheme alone, approvals have issued in more than 80% of these cases and a new online claim system is now open to applicants.  A new TAMS tillage scheme will be added shortly.<\/p><p> The six-year beef data and genomics programme is now in its second year with 24,500 farmers positively engaging with the scheme.  Compliance with all aspects of the scheme is very positive, with payments expected to commence in December.  I expect that the 2016 budget of &euro;52 million will be fully consumed by year end.  <\/p><p> The new organic farming scheme was launched in April and has been hugely successful since its launch.  When all applications into the new scheme have been processed we should have over 1,600 organic farmers in the system managing some 65,000 hectares of land.<\/p><p> The locally-led measure is a new approach to tackling some of the environmental and other challenges facing the agriculture sector.  This will empower local groups to develop new solutions to local challenges.  We will recruit projects by open call before the end of the year.  At the same time, we are also rolling out two new projects focusing on the conservation of the hen harrier and the freshwater pearl mussel.  These too will be locally-led.<\/p><p> We have submitted two amendments to the rural development programme in recent times.  The first was submitted in 2015 and the second in 2016.  The first was approved in June of this year and provided for some new measures under TAMS, including tillage and sheep fencing, and some adjustments to GLAS and the Burren scheme.  The second was submitted to the Commission in September.  It includes provision for the new sheep welfare scheme, support for beef producer organisations and some adjustments to GLAS and European Innovation Partnerships.  Our expectation is that, given progress to date, formal approval will be issued by year end, but we are dependent on the Commission in that regard.<\/p><p> The &euro;241 million European maritime and fisheries operational fund, launched in 2016, is being rolled out and will be rolled out further in 2017.  We will be spending approximately &euro;20 million this year and &euro;40 million next year.  This investment will fund a range of programmes including capital investment in the seafood processing, aquaculture and fishing sectors to foster growth in production and to enhance sustainability and competitiveness.  The Department also continues to develop the infrastructure at the fishery harbour centres with &euro;15.9 million allocated this year for the six fishery harbour centres and Cape Clear and &euro;4.5 million for local authority harbours. <\/p><p> In conclusion, the Department is a diverse organisation with a broad variety of skills and experiences providing a dynamic range of services to our customers.  We have engaged in significant restructuring over the past number of years.  In fact, the staffing of the Department has declined by more than one third since 2005.  This restructuring has been driven by investment in IT development and greater use of on-line facilities and facilitated by reductions in animal disease levels.  Currently IT technology across the world is undergoing a seismic growth, particularly in the areas of data analytics, social media, cloud computing and sensor technology, and the Department is currently compiling a new ICT strategy which will focus on these rapidly emerging technologies.<\/p><p> During the moratorium on recruitment to the public service, our staff levels decreased to critical levels.  However, our staff displayed great resilience and commitment and continued to deliver a high quality service.  We are now in the early stages of a rebuilding phase, which will see some increase in staff numbers, but within very strict financial limits.<\/p><p> Before I finish, I would like to mention our new Oireachtas liaison unit.  This was set up in June this year to assist Oireachtas Members with individual queries received from constituents.  To date, there are 73 Deputies and Senators using the system and it is expected that this will grow quickly.  We think it is working very well and hope that Members will find it useful and a more efficient means of getting relatively straightforward queries dealt with in a fast turnaround time.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with the committee as we continue our work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Driscoll for his comprehensive opening statement.

I have a few questions but, first, to follow on from his final point, I also commend his office on the Oireachtas liaison unit which I agree is very helpful.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll indicated that more than &euro;900 million has so far been paid out in direct payments in 2016.  An issue that has come to my attention in several cases recently relates to farmers who are audited on land eligibility.  Many of them are not aware that they are under assessment until such time as the payment does not arrive and they make inquiries and then find out.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll elaborate on why that is the case?  Could those audits not be brought forward and carried out in early or late summer, thereby ensuring farmers' payments are not delayed?  Is that a matter of staffing?  What exactly is the dynamic behind the delay?  <\/p> <p>  Slurry spreading is a particularly pertinent issue at the moment.  The issue is a local one to particular parts of the country where ground conditions were acute until two to three weeks ago.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll outline what the situation is for those farmers who were not able to get slurry on the ground in advance of the deadline due to extenuating circumstances?  A number of farmers have contacted me about this and there seems to have been quite a bit of confusion in the past two or three days in terms of feedback and the situation that they face.  Some flexibility has to be allowed.  This relates to a small number of areas but a number of people are affected by it. <\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll touched on product prices.  Beef, in particular, is under a lot of pressure at the moment.  I want to focus on the Department's role in the export trade and, in particular, trade with Turkey.  What does the Department expect the level of exports to Turkey to be, in particular over the coming weeks, but also over the coming months?  How many exporters have been approved?<\/p><p>I understand that one exporter has been approved.  Mr. Cahill might comment on that and whether there is potential for additional exporters to be approved, which would open up that market further and lead to an increase in the number of exports.  I understand three vessels have been approved.  Some of the vessels approved could be in business in other parts of the world, separate to the Irish export trade.  Does Mr. O'Driscoll believe the Department could play a role in addressing that matter?<\/p><p> With regard to the rural development programme, RDP, schemes and the level of underspend so far on the targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, what is the Department's assessment of that level of underspend?  The average spend is less than what would have been projected, particularly in the GLAS, and the numbers are less than the total projected in both cases.  Mr. O'Driscoll might comment on the level of underspend to date.  On the reopening of the GLAS, the removal of low input permanent pasture and hedge cutting as an option in previous GLAS schemes inhibited some farmers' ability to increase their level of payments.  What will be the position regarding those two measures when it is reopened in November?<\/p><p> What is the position on the old young farmers, which has been a problem since the current CAP programme came into play?  There has not been a resolution of that but is it an issue the Department is willing to look at again?  Is it possible, at national level, to seek to change that?  My understanding is that it is within our gift.  Could Mr. O'Driscoll confirm whether that is the case and, if so, what is his view on it?<\/p><p> I want to make two points, the first of which is on the need to provide sufficient resources to Bord Bia to meet the challenges of Brexit.  An increase has been provided for in the budget, but did Bord Bia make specific requests in terms of what it felt its resource need would be to meet that challenge?  Were those requests met in full?<\/p><p> With regard to the upcoming deadline for commonage management plans to allow farmers be paid their GLAS payments, that is a particularly acute issue in terms of all farmers, and particularly advisers, being able to submit those in time for payments to be made.  Can flexibility be shown regarding that deadline in order to allow farmers to make their submissions and planners to deal with the amount of work affecting them?  It would also ensure that the payments for farmers with commonage are not delayed as a result of the deadline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#G00300","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials from the Department.  I dealt with Mr. O'Driscoll for many years in a different role and it has always been a pleasure to work with him.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a number of points.  With regard to the major challenges Brexit poses for us, there is a huge amount of North-South trade.  Three million litres of milk a day comes from the North to the South to be processed.  Forty per cent of Northern Ireland cattle are brought South to be killed and processed.  What impact will that have on the quality assurance schemes we operate here?  How will that work into the future?  The United Kingdom can operate to different standards from the ones to which we operate here, namely, EU standards.  How will that be dealt with in the future?<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue mentioned the huge difficulties for the beef sector.  This is the perennial chestnut in that once our kill exceeds 30,000 head of cattle, market prices go one way.  Has there been a submission from the board of Bord Bia in terms of the extra funding it would require to lessen our dependence on the UK market with the upcoming Brexit?  Also, what level of resources is Bord Bia putting into live exports?  I sat on the board of Bord Bia for a number of years and I often felt that not enough funding was put into sourcing live export outlets for our cattle, and that there was a reluctance on the part of some members of the board to promote live exports.  However, we have a significant number of extra cattle coming on-stream.  We have had a kill for the past four weeks of 36,000 head but the reality is that next year we will have at least another 100,000 or 120,000 extra stock in the country, which will make a poor situation worse.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue made a point about live exports and asked about the number of vessels available to us to get the cattle out of the country.  While the Turkish market is open, they are taking a specialised, younger type animal.  In the short to medium term, they will not have an impact on the number of cattle killed.<\/p> <p>  The UK would be a significant market for forward stores.  We have found it very difficult to get our cattle killed on an even keel in the UK.  Can progress be made on that?  If we can export forward stores to the UK, can equal access be secured for them alongside UK cattle to slaughter units in the UK?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll referred to the uptake of the milk reduction scheme.  Applicants can apply for as much under this scheme as they want and no penalty is imposed if there is not full uptake of it.  I believe the uptake here will be small.  We have had a very good October weather wise and, thankfully, prices have started to recover but we have come through a difficult period of milk prices.  Has any analysis been done of when northern European countries will start to increase production again?  Prices have been driven up by the reduction in production in several parts of the world.  Germany and France have dramatically reduced production, as has the UK.  Argentina and New Zealand are having their own weather problems and that has also impacted on production worldwide.  With the price of grain at its current level, when will be the next curve that will see a milk production increase?  Our industry cannot afford another hit like the one we got over the past 12 to 18 months.  Some measure will have to be put in place.  Changes to the income tax system for farmers are proposed in the Finance Bill but that will not go any way towards allowing farmers to deal with the current volatility being experienced.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the afforestation programme, the hen harrier is referenced a number of times in the report we received from Mr. O'Driscoll.  If we are to have any hope of meeting the target set in that programme, the blanket ban on forestry plantation in special areas of conservation will have to be reviewed and analysed.  There is evidence that the hen harrier will thrive in areas where there are different stages of growth of afforestation.  I have been told that the special areas of conservation figures are decreasing where blanket bans are in place.  It is crucial that we meet the target set for the afforestation programme at this time of climate change.  That needs to be examined and researched.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the decrease in the incidence of bovine tuberculosis, TB.  If we were to talk to farmers in County Wicklow, we would not get agreement on that.  While we have made great progress on the vaccination of badgers - and where there was a breakdown in tackling the problems presented by badgers - we have ignored the problem of deer contributing to the spread of TB.  We have had a very bad outbreak in the past two weeks in my county, which has seen a decrease of 80% to 85% in dairy herds.  There would be forestries near those holdings.  We have to research whether deer numbers are contributing to the spread of TB, how they are contracting it and from which species are they being infected.  I saw figures for County Wicklow which show that 18% of deer that were captured had TB.<\/p><p>It will be an ongoing issue and the Department must address it.  We cannot ignore the deer population.  Recently, I met farmers from Wicklow who feel that the issue of the deer population must be tackled immediately.<\/p><p> The Secretary General talked about Animal Health Ireland and the progress we have made on disease.  In the bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, eradication programme, the non-compulsory removal of persistently infected animals, PIs, was inexcusable.  At the start of the scheme, we were promised it would last three years.  Farmers are getting worried that it will run and run.  I cannot understand how PIs were left in herds.  I know the rules have been tightened.  However, it should never have happened.  There should have been legislation with the scheme to specify that PIs had to be automatically removed.  Farmers cannot understand it.  The failure to remove PIs was unacceptable.<\/p><p> The Secretary General talked about tenders for tags.  We are moving from the single tender of the past to multiple tenders.  The standard of our tags cannot be compromised.  We have built up our reputation as producers of top-quality food based on our traceability scheme and our tags have stood up to much scrutiny over a number of years.  However the tender works out, the security of tags must not be compromised.<\/p><p> On the single farm payment issue, improvements have been made and there are not as many people waiting for their single farm or areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments as there were last year.  However, there are still too many, in a year when farmers incomes are on the floor.  I cannot comprehend that, with all our computerised systems, where an application is submitted in mid-May and money is due in mid-October, a farmer finds out there is a problem only when he or she does not receive the money.  It must be more streamlined and farmers must be told in mid-summer if there is a problem in order to allow time to resolve it so the payment can be made in time.  Farmers' cashflows are at a low ebb.  I have received a number of calls since the single farm payment was issued last week.  The satellite inspections should all be dealt with before the payment deadline.  It is not acceptable.<\/p><p> Approvals are still very slow to come from the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS.  We have dairy farmers who want to do work during the dry cow period.  A number have contacted me, and approvals are very slow.  It must be speeded up.  When an application goes in for approval, we need something.  There must be a turnaround period for the applications.  It is not fast enough and it must be improved.  Last Friday morning, I contacted my local office and they told me they did not have the computer system to issue payments for work completed.  I know farmers who have had their work done since last spring.  To be told there is no system in their local office to issue their payments is incomprehensible.  It must be sorted immediately.<\/p><p> The Secretary General mentioned organic farming.  When the quality assurance inspection is being done, there should be a section for farmers who want to seek organic status so they could be certified on the same day.  A couple of organic farmers groups have raised this with me.  There are different criteria for different organic organisations.  The Department and Bord Bia should get hold of the organic sector and make it part of the quality assurance inspection system.  We have a dairy side and a beef side.  It would be very easy to have an organic side for those who want to opt for it and have all the inspections done in one visit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#H00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>We will go back to Mr. O'Driscoll.

I thank the Deputies.  Both mentioned Brexit, in particular the North-South dimension.  The issues are complicated and stretch across a whole series of areas.  We are particularly conscious that there are companies that straddle the Border and take supplies from both sides.  This happens in dairy and in the movement of sheep, pigs and cattle for slaughter up and down between the two jurisdictions.  A hard Border could be extremely disruptive, to put it at its mildest.  We have been having detailed discussions with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and have set up a series of work streams with them to try to prepare as best we can.  There is a huge amount of uncertainty.  We cannot predict the exact outcome of the negotiations.  Members have heard the desire on the part of both the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that there will not be a hard Border.  Therefore, we have to imagine what it might mean when Brexit unfolds.<\/p> <p>  We are doing a couple of things.  We have a very strong engagement with all the stakeholders, by which I mean the companies involved, the farming organisations and so on.  We are co-ordinating with our agencies to provide assistance to companies which are trying to cope with the uncertainty.  Bord Bia has hosted a number of seminars, particularly for the smaller companies that are most challenged.  We are working with our colleagues in Northern Ireland to try to imagine our way forward under various scenarios and see how things might operate in practice.  We have a very close relationship with our equivalents in Northern Ireland and this work will prove useful, regardless of what comes from it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about land eligibility and the reason for the delay, as he put it, in audits.  While inspections are spread through the year, risk analysis must be done on what inspections to undertake, and this can be done only after applications come in.  The level of inspections is set out very clearly in the regulation.  In most cases, the level of inspection is approximately 5% for land eligibility purposes across most of the measures.  To try to reduce the burden on farmers, we try to stack inspections, where we can.  When we can do two inspections in a single visit, we do it.  This reduces the number of inspections for eligibility purposes from approximately 17,500 to 7,500.  It is a very effective way of reducing the burden.  Within this are included ground inspections and remote sensing inspections.<\/p> <p>  We are also trying to ensure that once a farm has been inspected, we process it to finalisation as quickly as possible.  One of the reasons for the high rate of payment and the significant increase in the rate of payment compared to recent years - higher amounts of money paid to more farmers - is the rapid processing of inspections and the results relating thereto.  Claims are moving forward to approval.  So far in 2016, we have paid &euro;735 million to 113,000 farmers under the basic payment scheme, BPS.  This is the latest figure.  It is a 13% increase on last year.  Likewise, we have paid &euro;179 million to 84,000 farmers in the ANC scheme, which is an 8.5% increase on last year.  Only four member states have paid at all.  Members have heard this from the Department before, and will have to forgive my saying it again.  We are so far ahead of the curve in our payments we are out of sight of all the other member states.  While I realise it is no comfort to those whose payments are delayed, it must be understood that we are far ahead of others.  We are processing the inspection cases as rapidly as we can in order that everybody will get paid.<\/p><p> The situation on slurry spreading here is pretty tricky.  Slurry spreading is directly the responsibility of a different Department but I will not hide behind that because it is a major issue for farmers.  If any confusion has arisen, we have said that if individual farmers have specific difficulties, particularly of an animal welfare nature arising from their inability to spread slurry, they can contact the nitrates unit of the Department and we will look into it.  We expect this will arise more when animals are housed than right now.  If issues arise that give rise to animal welfare concerns, we can look at it on a case-by-case basis but I do not want to make any promises here I cannot keep.  <\/p><p> On the general issue of the slurry spreading deadlines, we have a really big challenge here.  Next year we have to introduce our new nitrates action programme, which will determine the derogations we will have going forward.  The nitrates action programme is renewed every four years and our 7,000 derogations are up for renewal.  These derogations are extremely important to us as are the dates on which we allow slurry spreading.  In recent times, there have been a number of developments that give rise to some degree of concern.  The Danes have not had their derogation renewed because the Commission was not satisfied with the progress they had made on water quality.  The Dutch have been told they have to reduce cow numbers as part of their renewal.  I do not want to overstate this or cause any alarm but in very recent days, the EPA has issued new water quality assessment which indicates a slight decline - about 3% - in unpolluted waterways.  We have some of the cleanest water in Europe so it needs to be understood that we are starting from a very good base.  Nevertheless, there has been some decline in water quality.  The EPA has identified agriculture as being responsible for some portion of that.  In the context of all of that, we have to be very careful about slurry spreading deadlines.  From a purely agricultural perspective and in the interests of the agricultural sector, given what has happened in other member states, we have to be careful here.<\/p><p> Beef prices is one of the main issues concerning us at the moment.  As Deputy Cahill said, there has been very significant downward pressure on prices recently.  Beef slaughterings are up approximately 56,000 this year to date.  This tends to put downward pressure on prices.  In addition, there is the movement of sterling, which also has an effect on prices.  UK prices had been moving in the opposite direction but have taken a sharp downward turn in the last week or so.  They are now about &euro;3.95 per kilogram in the UK overall - slightly higher than that in Great Britain and below it in Northern Ireland.  A number of factors also are at work in the background.  In global markets, there has been a rise in world beef production, which is reflected in an increase in Brazil's exports and in a rise in production globally as projected by the USDA.  Furthermore, as Deputy Cahill correctly says, the general expectation is there will be an increase in slaughterings in 2017 also.  All of that paints a rather difficult picture.  <\/p><p> On the positive side, Turkey has opened its market and we have seen two movements there of 1,700 cattle and then 3,300 weanlings last week with a third shipment being assembled now.  The Minister is going to Algeria and Morocco in the next week or so.  One objective of that mission is on the live export side.  My impression at the moment is that boats are not a particular limitation.  I am open to correction on that.  We are always available to examine and approve boats.  I am not aware that it is a particular constraint at the present time.  Trade to Turkey is new.  There is one exporter involved in it.  It is putting some strain on the Department's systems because it is new and the cattle have to be assessed for health, quarantined, certified and so on.  There are about ten assembly centres around the country being operated at the moment.  It is a new burden of work for the Department but there is no hold-up there.  We see some potential to further develop that market.  We are also looking at other markets.  It is also important to say that in recent times we have opened a large number of markets for beef around the world.  It is part of a strategy of diversifying our markets as much as possible.  We have always said that a single dependence on the UK was very undesirable.  While the UK is and will remain one of our markets, we have opened a wide number of markets throughout the world -14 for Irish beef, four for pigmeat and four for sheepmeat.  The beef markets we have opened are in Singapore, Egypt, Japan, Iran, Lebanon, Namibia, Philippines, New Caledonia, Turkey, Oman, USA, Israel, Maldives, China and Canada.  We are working hard on China.  The significance of this is that the best risk mitigation measure we can take in difficult market conditions is to have as many market options as we can find.  That is why we have worked so hard in China and why we have worked on the USA.  Our main strategy at this time is to open the live export markets, facilitate them as much as we can and then to open as many markets globally as we can.  There is no point in me disguising that the movement of sterling, given that 50% of our beef goes to the UK, is very difficult.  This affects products across the board, not only beef.  The UK is a major importer of many of these products.  Past experience suggests that we should expect some pass-through of devaluation into prices eventually.  We realise we cannot depend on that.<\/p><p> I will move on a little bit more quickly on the other items.  Deputy McConalogue asked about the RDP scheme underspend.  The main point I would make is that the reason for the underspends is that we always make generous provision in the Estimates for our RDP schemes.  Our RDP schemes are, almost without exception, demand-driven.  If we do not make sufficient provision, we could find ourselves in a position where we run out of money, if we have very tightly estimated the amount of money required in any year.  It is always a difficulty.  These are multi-year schemes but we have an annual budget cycle.  It is an issue that in a previous life I tried to explain to previous committees because the interaction of those two things is quite complex.  It is important that we have adequate provision in the Estimate each year for our RDP schemes.  That is why it is so significant that the Minister has announced we will have over &euro;600 million for the RDP schemes in 2017, which is a record amount.<\/p><p> Deputies McConalogue and Cahill asked about resources for Bord Bia.  If my namesake Aidan Cotter was here, I have no doubt he would tell you he could usefully spend lots more funding.  I have no doubt that he could spend it usefully.  We have a continual engagement with Bord Bia on the resources it uses.  The Minister has indicated that in the Revised Estimates, Bord Bia will get a significantly increased allocation in 2017.<\/p><p>That will be used to deal with the marketing measures around Brexit.  It has already announced an interesting &euro;500,000 marketing innovation measure in recent weeks, which will assist small and medium enterprises which are struggling a little in the current circumstances.  It is a good initiative and shows that quite a small amount of money can be usefully spent.  We will be assessing what is required, in addition to the 2017 allocation.  Brexit, unfortunately, is not a one-year affair.  It will probably take a few years of uncertainty before we find our way through all this.  We will be assessing what additional actions are required on foot on Brexit and we will not hesitate to knock on the door of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the funding that we consider is needed.<\/p><p> Regarding commonage framework plans, we have introduced a measure to make it somewhat easier for advisers who are undertaking commonage framework plans under GLAS, recognising that they will have to accommodate farmers who are coming in under the third tranche of GLAS and who do not yet have their plans fully completed.  We have also appointed advisers where advisers could not be found to undertake commonage framework plans.  We have gone ahead and appointed advisers through Teagasc to provide that service to the farmers in those areas.  Our aim, very definitely, is to ensure, as Deputy McConalogue suggested, that 2016 GLAS payments should not be delayed for the want of commonage framework plans.  That is our intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Driscoll might also address the issue of old young farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>That issue is one that cuts across EU provisions.  There are EU provisions in place relating to the definition of a young farmer that we cannot change.  Built into both the direct payments and the rural development regulation is a definition of a young farmer that we cannot simply get around.  There is a significant EU element to that issue, which makes that difficult.    Deputy Cahill was right in what he said about the milk reduction scheme.  There were 4,400 applicants for the first tranche of that scheme.  There is no penalty in that respect so many of those applications may not follow through.  The farmers who applied for it were quite clever to do so and why would they not?  It was a free shot, as it were, at getting extra funding.  There is &euro;150 million on the table under that scheme and if farmers can get hold of it, why not?  However, as a country, we are not going down the milk production reduction route, rather we are going down the route of increasing milk production.  If some of our farmers find advantage in the scheme, there is no reason they should not take advantage of it.<\/p> <p>  I cannot say when grain prices will turn.  It is a very significant global issue.  We are introducing a series of measures that we think will benefit our tillage farmers.  The tillage TAMS, targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, will be introduced by the end of the year.  The agri-loan scheme, to which I referred - the SBCI scheme mentioned by the Minister in the Estimates - should be of significant benefit to tillage farmers.  There are measures under GLAS and so on that are very relevant to tillage farmers.<\/p> <p>  On the incidence of bovine tuberculosis, TB, Wicklow was specifically mentioned and it is regularly mentioned.  It is true to say that in west Wicklow, in particular, the incidence rates of TB are quite high.  Currently the incident rate is 11.9% in west Wicklow and 7.15% in east Wicklow and those rates contrast sharply with an incidence rate of a little over 3% nationally.  Therefore, we have a problem in that area, of that there is no doubt.<\/p> <p>  We are talking to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs regarding the deer population.  We are hoping to have a limited cull in the Calary area, working through the two Departments in the near future.  There is also a proposal to introduce a pilot deer fencing project, which may also help.  Every initiative helps.  Another proposal is to undertake a more comprehensive study of the incidence of TB in the county as a whole.  The deer population may be part of the issue in Wicklow.  My animal health experts tell me that it is not the whole picture by any means.  Therefore, a detailed examination of exactly what is going on in the Wicklow area is merited and, hopefully, that will provide a way forward but we are also undertaking a cull.  I read in a newspaper article today that over 4,000 licences for deer hunting have been awarded to hunters around the country.<\/p> <p>  We are making a good deal of progress on the issue of bovine viral diarrhoea persistently infected, BVD PI, animals, but as the Deputy knows, we have found that we have to make more and we have to continue tissue tagging.  I agree with the Deputy that it is very unsatisfactory for farmers to retain PIs on their farms; it is not acceptable.  The Department has made a great deal of effort to persuade farmers to cease holding PIs and it makes payments to farmers who do not hold them.  There are still approximately 200 herds that are restricted due to retained PIs and we are trying to reduce that number.  It used to be at a much higher level.  We are also notifying PIs to neighbours as part of that continuing effort.  In terms of addressing BVD, the estimated benefit to farmers is &euro;66 million to date from 75% reduction we have got.  If we got 100% reduction, that benefit to farmers would be more than &euro;100 million.  It would be money in farmers' pockets.  We have to press on with this and we cannot allow a limited number of people to hold us back.  I am completely at one with the Deputy on that.<\/p> <p>  I agreed that we should not compromise on standards in terms of tags.  We are moving to have multiple tags.  I imagine the evaluation committee may be sitting as we speak, but no tags are being tested independently and that process is ongoing.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of TAMS approvals, more than 80% of applications in the first two tranches have been approved and we are working through the approvals in the other tranches, but we have hit a completely different problem.  The Deputy was misinformed about the payment system or the information he got may have been somewhat out of date.  The payment system is in place now.  The claims system is in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>It is not entirely up to date, or it was not on Friday.

At present, our bigger emphasis is on urging people with approvals in tranches 1 and 2, who perhaps are doing the work, to move forward to claim stage so we can begin to see the expenditure on this.  When we did not have the claim system in place - it was put in place only last July - we were getting quite an amount of grief about it, with people saying that because the claim system was not in place there were many claims waiting.  In fact, there were not.  They have not materialised.  I understand there is significant paperwork to be completed around some of this and that people sometimes submit claims with the wrong paperwork and so forth.  However, there is a broader and more fundamental problem here of people perhaps not doing the work, not completing it or not telling us what they are doing and we will have to find a way forward on that.<\/p> <p>  On organics, there are up to 1,600 farmers in organics, which is approximately 65,000 hectares of land.  It is still tiny by EU standards.  I was talking to our staff in organics within the last week.  Organic payments in 2015 amounted to &euro;8 million and projected expenditure in 2016 is &euro;11 million.  There are 1,680 organic farmers in the system.  I believe there is a significant market opportunity here.  When we were in Singapore with the Minister we went to a massive, very high end supermarket.  The manager reached up and took a pot of Glenisk yogurt from the shelf and told us that in his supermarket demand for organic product is increasing by 30% per year.  It is all at the high end.  He was very flattering about the Glenisk product and said he could sell as much of this stuff as we could produce.  At the same time, we produce infant formula for a company that exports globally, but its organic infant formula in China is sourced in Denmark because the volume does not exist in Ireland.  We see a future for organic product.  People have different views about organic produce, but that is not the point.  The point is the market is there and we should just see it as a market opportunity, whatever one's view of the issue.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry for talking at length.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>There were many topics to discuss.

The &euro;150 million will be a huge benefit, if it gets out to the people concerned.  That is the issue, so let us not tiptoe around it.  If the pillar banks impose criteria that disallow the money from being disbursed, it is pointless.  What are the Department's plans regarding the criteria for the &euro;150 million and to what extent does it intend to be involved with that?  Chairman, I believe this committee should make a presentation on those criteria to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  If this money is going to replace farmers' other loans and the only benefit to farmers is that they will have a lower interest rate, that is not a real benefit for the tight cashflow scenario in which people find themselves.  That is one matter.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the TAMS and the breakdown, does Mr. O'Driscoll have data relating to the number of people who contacted the help-line with regard to slurry storage?  Will he also give the breakdown of the &euro;4.5 million for the local authority harbours?<\/p> <p>  On the pilot deer fencing project, while I am a Deputy from Wexford, the parish in which I live is bordered by Wicklow.  The wooded areas and forest land reach into north Wexford, so there is a huge problem.  There is no need to tell Mr. O'Driscoll about it as he is aware of it.  Where the information and research is available, there should be prioritisation in the deer fencing project for people who have wildlife problems, particularly when a person's livelihood is at risk.  It is really important.  I am a dairy farmer and most of us might go down in the test once or twice in our lifetime.  However, for people whose land bounds woodlands, going down every three years does not give them a viable livelihood.  This is something every member of the committee should encourage.  Those farmers are really stretched when they go down on that number of occasions.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 50% of our livestock beef goes to the UK market.  It is important not to over-sell the penetration into some of the markets Mr. O'Driscoll itemised.  We might have a presence in 60 different markets but the UK market might account for more than those.  Perhaps Mr. O'Driscoll could give us a breakdown in that regard.  I recall there was a benefit in getting back into the US market, but there were very few high end top cuts going there.  Does Mr. O'Driscoll have a breakdown of the value of the product per market?  I do not need the breakdown for all 50 or 60 but perhaps he could provide the top four or five if he has that information.

The main problem with the Department's staff being cut by a third is that it is reflected on the ground in the relationship between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the farming community.  At one time the Department was portrayed as always having somebody at the end of the telephone to give advice.  The further automation of the Department really concerns me.  In addition, there are no plans, now that the moratorium has been lifted, to increase the number of staff in the Department.  Farmers in rural Ireland want a relationship with a human being, not a machine.  That is a major concern.<\/p> <p>  Will there be a national reserve in place for 2017?  When will existing young farmers be paid?  With regard to dairy farming and the emergency fund put in place last year whereby dairy farmers received the same payment across the board, currently moves are being made to equate the level of payment to the amount of milk produced.  This would see the large producers gain more from the fund at the expense of small dairy farmers.  That is causing much hardship for small dairy farmers, particularly in the area from which I come in Mayo.<\/p><p>Is land with heather still excluded from permanent pasture measure under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS?  There was no room for this kind of marginal land in the previous two schemes.  Has it been addressed in the new scheme?  Restricting the maximum of permanent pasture and traditional hay meadow to 10 ha has greatly reduced income from GLAS.  Will that be increased?  When will GLAS payments for 2016 be made?<\/p><p> Beef prices are down to &euro;150 per head.

The ANC areas are up for review next year.  Many of the farmers in these areas, particularly those with marginal land, will be hoping they will get a bit extra out of it.  When will the criteria be set for this?<\/p> <p>  Some farmers are ineligible for the young farmer scheme because they have been farming for too long but are underage.  I accept the Department's point about how it breaches the EU guidelines.  Is there an opportunity to develop a solution to this?  It only involves a small cohort of farmers.  Naturally, they feel aggrieved they have been left out and nothing has been done.<\/p> <p>  In Sligo and Leitrim, there are many investors buying up land to plant it with forestry.  The fact a non-farmer can get the same level of forestry grant as a farmer has caused many problems as local farmers cannot compete when buying land.  It used to be the case the active farmer got a higher level of grant than the non-farmer.  Is there any scope to revert back to that system again?  The level of tax-free income a person can make from forestry is limitless.  Is there any possibility of reviewing that?  I accept the whole afforestation drive is to reduce CO2 emissions.  However, small farmers, particularly in my community, have seen this become a gravy train for wealthy people to make much money at their expense.  It is an issue which needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  Due to the recent wet weather, there is a possibility of a fodder crisis later in the year in some parts of the country.  That also relates to the slurry-spreading problem we have.  Farmers, certainly in the west, could not spread slurry anytime between July and September because of the wet conditions on the land.  However, the weather has been good this October but they were not allowed to spread slurry.  Farming by calendar rather than conditions on the ground is not working.  Is there any possibility of addressing this?<\/p> <p>  The fodder crisis would be greatly alleviated if there were a drainage scheme in place for farmers on marginal land.  The last time a grant aid for a drainage and reclamation scheme was back in the 1970s.  There is nothing for it now.  For example, one can get a grant of over &euro;3,000 per hectare to establish forestry.  If even half that amount was available for land drainage, many farmers would feel they had the opportunity to work their land better and appropriately.<\/p> <p>  There seem to be little supports for the equine sector.  I am sure I am not the only Member who has got e-mails from various groups, such as Connemara Pony Breeders Society, and other sectors, who feel they get little or no support for marketing, breeding and so forth.  While some of these may be niche industries, they could be developed with more support.<\/p> <p>  The mushroom and poultry industries rely considerably on heat.  North of the Border there is a grant scheme in place for farmers to use woodchip boilers rather than oil or other fossil fuels.  This scheme is partly funded through Europe but we do not have it here.  Our mushroom and poultry farmers are competing with farmers north of the Border who can produce at a much keener price because their input cost is lower because of that scheme.  Is there any possibility of looking at a similar scheme for here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#N00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll gave a fantastic and in-depth presentation.  One issue he raised was the TB eradication programme.  Margaret Good, who works in the Department, is the European, if not the world expert, on TB.  One issue that comes up is the eight-hour test compared to the 24-hour blood test and how they fit into the system.  I have heard of cases where a skin test, an eight-hour test and 24-hour test have been done but with different results and a different view taken after.  Then there are issues over different district veterinary offices, DVOs, taking issues regarding a reactor and when a neighbours' herd is locked up or not.  There are different approaches across the country.  Is there one straight view regarding this?  I admit I am a vested interest at the moment but that is another issue.  However, we need to work out in detail where the skin test falls into the 24-hour test, or the eight-hour test and what is considered to be a reactor afterwards.  If the animal goes to the factory and has lesions, how is this dealt with?  Farmers need clarity in this area.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll spoke in detail about the BVD, bovine viral diarrhoea, eradication scheme.  It has been a fantastic initiative which has worked very well.  Johne's disease is now another issue, particularly for the dairy industry, and how that fits in with what we do abroad and how we market our product.  Will Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll expand on where the Department is going with its Johne's disease programme, its long-term plan and how it will drive the initiative?<\/p> <p>  It is positive that direct payments have increased by 13% and 8%, respectively.  There is a question about the number of people who have not been paid and not been notified.  People have been phoning around asking others if they got the text and if they had been paid.  It is like the lotto.  There is a better way of doing this.  If there is an issue, people should be informed rather than waiting for a text.  If they do not get a text, they should be brought into the loop.  I never quite understood why we could not pay the 70% and then take the reductions out of the 30% payment in the second round.<\/p><p>People need that 70%, particularly this year.  If there is to be a reduction, unless it is a huge reduction, which rarely happens, the 70% should be paid automatically and the 30% can be worked on after that.  The number of queries on this issue is amazing.  The main queries I received this year, as opposed to other years, were from people who had two or three transfers, whether they were going into a company or leasing entitlements.  I am aware of four people who have gone into a company and are renting their own entitlements.  Those are the people who have been held up.  Is it that they are falling through the Department, so to speak, or are those cases just falling on my desk?  Is that an issue we are propping up, so to speak?<\/p><p> It would be remiss of me not to ask Mr. Paul Dillon about the position on the Haulbowline project, which is unique to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in terms of driving forward development in Cork Harbour.

That will result in a saving in their energy costs and reduce the carbon emissions.  I believe the initial scheme for the accelerated capital allowances was extended to the end of 2017 in budget 2015.  With regard to farmers who might like to buy a wind turbine or solar panels and engage in micro-generation or a district heating system to address issues of heat and contain those costs in an energy efficient manner, the scheme was previously extended for three years but is 2017 the window of opportunity for farmers to invest in such energy efficient equipment or has the scheme been extended further?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#O00200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Driscoll has a long list of queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>I have, but all of them are interesting.  I will deal with them as best I can in the order they were put to me.  I will start with Senator Conway-Walsh.  I take the Senator's point that farmers want human contact.  The Department tent at the ploughing championships is amazing in terms of the thousands who visit.  My colleague beside me, Kay Ryan, organises it and it is a sight to be seen as farmers come through in huge numbers.  They do that because they want to see a human face.  They come with all their problems, and the set-up in the tent is fantastic.  If they need to, farmers can go from one part to another to get various issues sorted out, whether it is animal health, payments, GLAS issues or whatever.  The Senator is right that they want the human contact.  At the same time, we are going down a route of increasing automation and online services.  Are they a contradiction?  I do not believe so.  Going down the online route means the initial trigger, the scheme application and so on, is done much more quickly.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what that has allowed this year, for example, farmers who previously submitted their claims on paper but on which a small error was made would have had them returned or the Department would called them to say it was completed incorrectly and the application might end up going back and forth and so on.  That is not a contact a farmer wants.  This allows pre-checks to be done before any penalty is applied on the basis of the online application.  The farmer submits the claim but if there is something on it that does not make sense, we can contact him or her to say that they may incur a penalty and to have another look at it.  That is a welcome development.<\/p> <p>  Where we have fallen down, and we fell down last year, which I admitted in my opening statement, was in terms of farmers who like to pick up a phone and call someone.  The days of going into the local office are over.  Farmers are busy and they do not have that much free time, but they like to pick up a phone and talk to a human being.  Last year, we were introducing over 20 new schemes in the Department.  Our staff numbers were way down and we were struggling.  My colleagues did a fantastic job but where we fell down was in the responses on the telephone.  Farmers could not get through to the Department.  Deputies and advisers could not get through either, and we were getting it in the neck, so to speak, from everybody.  A new system has been put in place and it seems to be working well.  Currently, we are getting about a 75% response rate on telephone calls.  That means when farmers ring, 75% of the calls are being answered on the spot while 25% of them go to voicemail and are answered within 24 hours.  Approximately half of the queries that come in can be dealt with on the spot by the person who answers the phone.  The other 50% are more complex and have to be referred to somebody who has more detailed knowledge, but the clearance rate on those is very high.  That is the human contact farmers want.  They want effective human contact.  They are not looking to have a chat.  The future is online applications and very effective telephone systems for people to follow up on their queries, problems, issues or whatever.  I hope it will also mean that the Senator will get better responses to queries brought to her in her clinics.<\/p> <p>  On the national reserve, that is a policy decision for the Minister; it is above my pay grade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>I will let that slide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#O00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>It is above my seniority level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>That is more like it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#O00700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1133,"content":"<p>With regard to the &euro;1,200 payment last year to dairy farmers, that was one way of doing things.  Obviously, it was very welcome.  Everybody likes to get a cheque in the post.  When we got the &euro;11 million this time around, we could have sent a very small payment to everybody but it would have been very small because the &euro;11 million was available to all livestock farmers.  The Deputy can imagine that it would have amounted to a few shillings.  It would not have been an effective thing to do, so we have gone down the other route of this loan scheme, which has taken some engineering.  We hope it will be available to everybody.  I will not go into all the technicalities but we intend it to be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  At the same time, there is another process going on in parallel, which is the payment for reducing one's production.  One could say that the bigger producer gets more from that, but I do not believe that is the way it will work out.  I believe that the producers who are reducing their production anyway will get it, which in this country would tend to be a smaller farmer.  The big guy is expanding, not reducing.  I do not see that money going to bigger farmers.  The position could be different in other countries.

It is also true that for 2018 we have to have an ANC redesignation, in other words a reclassification of lands available.  ANCs, or disadvantaged areas as they were known, have been around for a long time and farmers are very attached to their payments.  It is a huge issue involving 100,000 farmers.

There are eight very specific biophysical criteria as follows: low temperature, which probably does not apply in our case as it means really low temperature; dryness, which definitely does not apply in our case; excess soil moisture, which applies a lot in our case; limited soil drainage, which applies a lot; unfavourable texture and stoniness, which is a significant issue in some areas; shallow rooting depth, which is less of an issue in Ireland; poor chemical properties, which applies in some parts; and steep slope.  Those are the criteria and they have been fixed for some time.<\/p> <p>  Our scientists have effectively been mapping; it will all end up as maps.  They have been testing soil samples throughout the country for these eight biophysical criteria.  Out of that will emerge a set of maps to see what areas do and do not qualify under these criteria.  Obviously, this will be a huge issue and I have no doubt it will attract considerable political attention.  It will probably be early next year before we begin to see the results of that.  However, we need to finalise it in 2017 because it has to be applied in 2018.<\/p> <p>  While the technical work is quite scientific, I should mention a few additional aspects.  One is called fine-tuning.  If an area is deemed to qualify, we are required to examine that area in more detail to see if within that overall area parts of it may have been improved sufficiently that it should no longer qualify as suffering from a natural constraint.  If a former natural constraint has been dealt with, it is no longer a natural constraint.  That is how the regulation is written.<\/p> <p>  Second, there is a provision that if an area is falling out of qualification, it can be phased out over a number of years.  Finally, there is a discretionary provision for 10% of the natural land area of the country that we can add in.  The national land area of the country is approximately 6.8 million ha, with about 4.4 million ha of agricultural land.  That would allow us an additional approximately 680,000 ha.  I ask members not to hold me to those figures, but it is of that order.  That allows for a good deal of flexibility, which it is to be hoped will assist us significantly in all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>What is the rationale for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#P00500","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>Political, if I was entirely honest.

A farmer who has low prices, high borrowings and big outgoings could, hopefully, with this product refinance that borrowing and get the benefit of a lower interest rate but if he felt his circumstances were such that he needed to go on interest only payments he could do so.

I know that my colleagues on the marine side are actively engaged with seaweed harvesters and there is very significant potential there.  This has been discussed at several SeaFest conferences.  There is amazing potential in some cases and there are a few companies mining this resource.  It does lead into questions of foreshore licensing and so on, quite complex issues which have been troubled in the past.  To be completely honest, I need to swot up on this before I can give a more comprehensive answer.<\/p> <p>  Forestry in Leitrim has received some coverage.  There was some misinformation about the level of afforestation in some parts of the country.  We have very detailed figures for every part of this country.  I was looking at our remote sensing data and forestry mapping in the past few days with our colleagues in Wexford.  It has to be understood that farmers still enjoy a significant advantage over non-farmers in afforestation because they get all the other payments as well, single farm payment, green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS and all the rest that non-farmers do not get.  Over 80% of the planting in Leitrim is done by farmers, if I remember the data correctly.  That is quite significant.  The tax reliefs on forestry are generous.  What an economist would call the subsidy, the tax breaks, the establishment grants and premiums all lumped together represent an enormous level of subsidy to forestry and overwhelmingly that goes to farmers.<\/p><p>It is establishing a new crop on Irish land and a new option for farmers, so they can go into a profitable new crop - new for many of them - on their land.  In general, Irish farmers then plant only part of their land but there are exceptions.  They do not reduce their agricultural production as they squeeze up their agricultural production a little bit on the rest of their land because their production is often very extensive.  That is the pattern to date.  At 11% of our land, Ireland has one of the lowest rates of afforestation in Europe, where the average is 38%.  Some countries are 70% afforested.  We have a national aim of getting up to 18%.  This is an important measure.  It is hugely important in the context of climate change and for our agriculture.  As I said in my opening statement, it is one of the great challenges and it is not coming down the tracks; it is here right now.  It is a real challenge for us.  Forestry is a very important part of our strategy for dealing with it.  It is also creating a new industry.  I have been in some of the plants.  I imagine we will have more discussion about it but this is the way we see it.<\/p><p> Haulbowline is a huge project with &euro;61 million estimated as the overall cost for the three elements.  The priority is the remediation of the east tip of the island where all the stuff from the old steel plant is and where the environmental risk is.  The old steel plant factory area requires remediation also.  The factory is no longer there but there is a very messy site.

Heat incentives are the responsibility of a another Department, as Mr. O'Driscoll said.  Willow will grow anywhere, but for it to be commercially viable it needs to grow on reasonably arable land.  Farmers cannot grow and cut it in a bog.  There is competition with land that might be somewhat marginal but not quite marginal enough.  The crop has to be accessible.  Therefore, farmers are competing with pasture land, perhaps, or land that is being used for farming.<\/p> <p>  This was an issue when the former Minister, Pat Rabbitte, and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, were in office.  What conversations took place between the Departments?  There is only so much land in the country and there were objectives for energy crops and ramping up agricultural production.  Where was the crossover and competing interests?  How was that teased out?  Was it ever teased out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016102500002#S01600","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>That is true.  I take the Senator's correction on land quality.  She is quite correct.  If farmers planted willow on peat or very low quality land it would not work.  It requires a reasonable quality of land to grow.  In many marginal counties, there is enough land that is good enough to grow willow.<\/p> <p>  I cannot remember the exact figure for the amount of willow and miscanthus that has been planted.  It is something like 3,000 ha or fewer - perhaps 2,500 ha - in the whole country, out of a total of 4.4 million ha of agricultural land.  We are a long way from having some sort of problem in terms of land use.<\/p> <p>  However, we found another problem.  Willow has to be able to compete.  Farmers know willow is a new crop and is, therefore, risky.  From their point of view anything that is new is risky, which is a reasonable attitude.  Farmers who have the most skill in this kind of thing and would probably have the easiest access to equipment would be tillage farmers.  In the past, the returns they made were more than they would have made from willow or miscanthus.  A study carried out by Fiona Thorn of Teagasc on this some years ago showed that quite clearly.  Dairy farmers would not participate because they got more money from dairying, therefore they would not give over their land to grow willow.<\/p> <p>  At that time, the crop did not pay tillage farmers.  Given the current difficulties in the tillage sector, maybe they would be more open to it now.  Some beef farmers would benefit by giving over some of their land.  It is similar to the forestry sector.  It is not a matter of getting rid of a beef enterprise.  Rather, it is a question of a farmer tightening up his or her beef enterprise a bit.  As we know, a lot of beef farming is done very extensively on land.  A farmer could tighten up his or her beef enterprise on a smaller land area and then grow willow on the rest.<\/p> <p>  I repeat that the Government as a whole and all of us have to get our act together.  We all share responsibility.

I understand that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will undertake a consultation within a year even though the process has been ongoing for a while.  The Department seems to be proposing that the renewable heat incentive, that it is discussing, would only be introduced for boilers with a capacity of around 500 kW.  That type of boiler is higher than what it takes to supply a mushroom house.  It would be more suitable for a massive hotel with a leisure centre.  In normal regional towns there are not many buildings with that level of need.  An average farmer with a holding of 40 or 50 acres or 20 to 30 ha who is considering planting willow they would not, on their own, have sufficient capacity to keep such a boiler maintained and fed.  The Governments in the North and Britain provide funding for 100 kW boilers.  Unless the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will fund a renewable heat incentive for boilers with a capacity for 100 kW and 200 kW then the average farmer will not enter this market.  Instead, those boilers will be fed through contracts with Coillte, for example, rather than with farmers.  I urge the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to engage with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to bend the proposals so that there is a certain number of those boilers.

Colleagues from the agency will talk about the more detailed figures for 2020.  <br\/><br\/>The two proposals are for the new period, 2021 to 2030, and to replace the existing regulation on effort sharing.  In October 2014 the European Council agreed an overall target of 40% by 2030 for the climate and energy package, compared to the figure for 1990.  It is to cover three areas: the non-emissions trading system sector; the ETS; and, in respect of this discussion, the land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, proposal.  The conclusions in 2014 set out the general guiding principles for what the non-effort sharing actions would be based on.  This was mainly to see how the non-ETS sectors would be dealt with in line with a similar methodology used previously for the existing regulation.  It was important that the target setting for member states be done on a gross domestic product, GDP, <i>per capita<\/i>basis.  It was also adjusted to reflect cost-effectiveness.  The availability and use of flexibility mechanisms were to be considered, while the multiple use objectives of agriculture were to be considered in terms of land use and land use change.<br\/><br\/>The 40% reduction is the European Union's contribution under the Paris Agreement at United Nations level.  The ratification process for the agreement is under way for Ireland and will be discussed in the D&aacute;il on Thursday.  <br\/><br\/>To some degree, the proposal on effort-sharing follows the work done on the existing regulation.  It has a couple of new aspects, in terms of flexibility.  A headline figure of 39% was given as an overall target based on GDP, but it adjusted downwards by 9 percentage points to reflect issues of cost-effectiveness.  There is additional flexibility in the regulation, in respect of the LULUCF, of up to 5.6% of 2005 emissions, while there is a once-off transfer of credits from the ETS to the non-ETS sector up to the equivalent of 4% of 2005 emissions.<br\/><br\/>This might be an opportune time to hand over to the agency for an overview of the 2020 targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1255,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for inviting us to attend.

We also have responsibility for the development and provision of national projections for emissions which take account of the effects of national and European policies and measures.  We implement the EU emissions trading scheme and have responsibility for the associated permitting, monitoring and reporting verification activities.  We also manage the EU emissions trading registry in Ireland, including credit auction monitoring.  The agency also provides the secretariat for the Climate Change Advisory Council and other supports, funding for climate change initiatives and emissions research.  While we have statutory responsibility in these areas, there is very much a collaborative approach to inventory compilation and projection estimates.  We work in co-operation with other agencies and bodies that provide essential data for these inventories and modelling for the projections.  Many of these organisations are represented today - the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI; Teagasc; the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI; University College Cork, UCC; as well as the relevant Departments.<\/p> <p>  Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide which arises mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels, methane and nitrous oxide which arise from enteric fermentation in the gut of ruminants, gases from cows, in other words, fertiliser application to land, livestock manure storage and land spreading.  There is another family called the F-gases that mainly arise from refrigeration and air conditioning systems.<\/p><p>Each of these various gases has different global warming potential.<\/p><p> The current published greenhouse gas inventories are for 1990 to 2014, inclusive.  The revision of these is under way and will include data from 2015.  It is a complicated process but work will be finalised on them in the coming weeks.  They will be published as revised provisional inventories.<\/p><p> In the breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions by sector in 2014, agriculture was the largest with 33.1%, transport was the second largest with 19.5%, followed by energy with 19.1%.  Aggregating agriculture, energy and transport, they accounted for 72% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions in 2014.  In 1990, transport accounted for 9.1%, an increase of 10%.  At the same time, the residential emissions share decreased from 13% to 10% and the agricultural share from 37% to 33%.  If one takes the absolute values rather than the percentages, total emissions in 1990 were 56.17 megatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent.  In 2014, it was 58.25 megatonne.  In that period, it represents a 3.7% increase in total annual emissions.<\/p><p> Total greenhouse gas emissions comprise two categories, those that come under the EU emissions trading system, EU ETS, and those covered by the effort sharing decision, also known as the non-ETS sector.  The non-ETS sector includes agriculture, transport, excluding the aviation sector, the built environment, which incorporates residential, commercial and institutional, and waste, essentially landfills.  When ETS and non-ETS figures are combined, in 2013 and 2014 Ireland was comfortably within its compliance targets.<\/p><p> The current emissions projections to 2020 are based on the latest inventory reference year which is 2014.  They take account of the available energy forecasts at the time, based on macroeconomic assumptions supplied by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  They also take account of agricultural data provided by Teagasc in December 2015, such as projected herd numbers, fertiliser usage, drainage - all the elements taken into account in Food Wise 2025.  When one takes the projected non-ETS emissions and compares it to annual emission allowances to 2020, we will be in breach in 2016 and 2017.  However, the accounting rules allow for us to take account of overachievement where we have not admitted as much in greenhouse gases as we are actually allowed.  If this cumulative approach is taken, we are likely to breach those limits in 2018 and 2019.<\/p><p> We project forward emissions in two ways.  The first is with measures, and that takes account of established Government policies, incentives and regulations which are being implemented.  Examples of that are carbon tax, VRT, motor tax biofuels obligation scheme and building energy efficient schemes.  Then there is the additional measures scenario for projections which takes into account policies, incentives and regulations announced by the Government but not yet implemented.  These would include policies such as renewable energy targets or energy efficient targets set out in policy documents like the national renewable action plan and the national energy efficiency action plan.  This relates to targets about percentage renewable fuels in transport, deployment of electrical vehicles, renewables for heating and those sorts of policies.  Under both scenarios, projections show Ireland will breach its 2020 targets in advance at 2018 and 2019.<\/p><p> It should be noted these are projections.  There are always ongoing processes such as annual audits which revise both the inventories and the projections.  These will all be taken account in the new inventories and projections for 2017.<\/p><p> The EU Climate and Energy Framework 2030 sets targets to cut emissions in EU territory by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.  In the new effort-sharing regulation proposal for the non-ETS sectors to be agreed for 2021 to 2030, it is proposed Ireland will reduce emissions by 30% below 2005 by 2030.<\/p><p>The new system introduces certain flexibilities we can avail of potentially, two of which I will mention.  The first is the use of credits from carbon sinks, the LULUCF sector.  This is capped at 5.6% of 2005 emissions.  I will discuss LULUCF shortly as we were specifically asked to mention it.  The other flexibility is around the use of EU emissions trading system, ETS, allowances, and that usage is proposed to be capped at 4% of 2005 emissions.<\/p><p> To reflect on LULUCF, some members will be very familiar with what is a wonderful acronym; others not so.  It stands for land use change and forestry.  It is important in the context of climate policy because forests and agricultural lands cover a substantial part of the EU territory and hold large sinks of carbon, preventing that escape of carbon into the atmosphere.  On the other hand, draining peat land, felling forests or ploughing up grassland generates emissions.  Members can see that actions such as afforestation or the conversion of arable land into grassland can protect carbon stocks or result in carbon sequestration or carbon capture.  Members can see that policy choices around the LULUCF sectors can have a positive or a negative impact on greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p> Under current projections, Ireland will likely not meet the 2020 targets even under the banking mechanism and with additional measures.  We see in the data insufficient decoupling of economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions, which increases the challenge for us of meeting our medium European Union and long-term national targets, which demand an aggregate reduction in CO2 emissions of at least 80% compared to 1990 levels by 2050 across the electricity generation sector and the built environment and transport sectors, as well as carbon neutrality in agriculture and land use.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.

If we cannot answer them now, we would be happy to return with additional information in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan.

It would be easy to deliver a long presentation because there is much that could be said on this topic, but I have restricted myself to answering five key questions which I hope will be of most interest to the members of the committee.  These questions are on slide 1.  How fast is climate change happening?  Did Ireland get a good deal in this legislative proposal we are discussing today?  What would be the implications for the fiscal space of inaction?  Is responding to climate change possible given the fiscal constraints of today, and how can we bring citizens with us?<\/p> <p>  First, in terms of how fast climate change is happening, needless to say, climate change is happening.  Human intervention is the main drive; we are mostly agreed on that.  The impacts will be severe, pervasive and irreversible.  That much is generally accepted.  However, there is an unhelpful narrative which tends to present climate change as a problem to be dealt with 50 or 100 years from now, but the impacts are evident now in the world around us.  This year, 2016, is on track to shatter the global temperature record.  In fact, in an unprecedented streak, as members can see from slide 2, every month for the past 16 months has shattered the previous record for that month.  That is alarming even the gloomiest climate scientists, and there are plenty of them.<\/p> <p>  The negative impacts are already with us in the world around us, whether it be wet winters in Ireland, drought in Syria, forest fires in Canada or rising temperatures across Africa, South America and parts of Asia, which are putting millions of people into food insecurity.  One-off events cannot be ascribed to climate change, but these impacts are consistent with model predictions.  I discuss that in more detail in the article referred to in slide 3.  The world is fast approaching an inflection point where dangerous climate change becomes inevitable.  To summarise, climate change is here and now, and so too is responsibility for action.  It is not for future generations, nor is it for future D&aacute;ileanna.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the second question as to whether Ireland got a good deal - I am back on topic with this question - the answer is \"Yes\".  Ireland got an excellent deal in the proposal, and it is still only a legislative proposal on the table.  This is because first, because Ireland's proposed target is significantly lower than comparable wealthy countries, as members can see from slide 4.  That is a recognition of the high cost of reducing emissions in Ireland's agriculture sector.  Second, the Commission is proposing to wipe the slate clean after 2020, therefore, Ireland's lack of progress in meeting its 2020 targets, which was just discussed, cannot be carried forward.  We will not be punished for that post-2020.  Members can see this somewhat bizarre outcome in slide 5.  I describe this as the Harry Potter proposal, and members can see why if they look at the slide, where Ireland's 2021 target will be significantly less onerous than its 2020 target.<\/p> <p>  A third favourable aspect for Ireland is that forestry can be used to offset some emissions, as discussed, and some carbon credits can be purchased from the EU instead of reducing emissions at home.  In fact, when these flexibilities are included, Ireland's \"real\" target is only slightly more demanding in 2030 than it is in 2020, as members can see from the slide.  This is a very good deal.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the third question on the fiscal implications of inaction, when one sets the proposed target against our projected emissions, the scale of the challenge becomes immediately apparent in slide 6.  The distance to target, Nos. 1 and 2 in slide 6, and flexibilities, which is No. 3 in slide 6, all imply a cost to the Exchequer.  If Ireland took no further action to reduce emissions in the period to 2030, we estimate a cost of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion.  I should stress that in many cases the numbers are subject to considerable uncertainty.  However, I have had them checked since by many experts in the field, including a number of officials across Departments.  This analysis needs to be refined over time but it provides a good, solid starting point.<\/p> <p>  I stress that this is a \"what if\" scenario, not a prediction.  Given fiscal rules, billions of euro spent on fines and carbon credits mean less money for schools, hospitals, income tax cuts or other political priorities.  The question is whether this would be better spent by creating jobs and investing in the low carbon economy at home.  While the deal on the table is a very good outcome from an Irish perspective, there is an immediate imperative to achieve more rapid decarbonisation, particularly in the agriculture, transport and buildings sectors.<\/p> <p>  That leads to the fourth question: is responding to climate change possible given fiscal constraints?  It is sometimes argued that Ireland cannot afford to meet its climate targets.  I hope I have convinced the members, from the analysis I have given, that this needs to be turned on its head.  I am suggesting that Ireland cannot afford to not meet its climate targets, but that argument never held much water in the first place.  This is where we get into slightly more controversial territory.  That is because, first, there were billions of euro of investment capital available to the Exchequer but we often chose to invest in locking in carbon rather than reducing it.  If we take the Capital Investment Plan 2016 to 2021, &euro;10 billion will be spent on transport, almost two thirds of which will go on roads, including economically and environmentally questionable projects such as the Gort to Tuam motorway, which was inundated in several places in the recent floods and which, ironically, were linked to climate change.  Meanwhile, as members can see on slide 8, the National Transport Authority recently announced that several cycling infrastructure projects could not be progressed due to lack of capital.<\/p> <p>  I understand the capital infrastructure plan is due for review in 2017.  Deciding between competing projects always comes down to difficult political choices.  Nevertheless, there is a case for much greater climate proofing of infrastructure plans and other expenditure items in light of climate targets.<\/p> <p>  The second reason I do not believe this lack of resources is a good argument is because, as shown on slide 9, even if there was nothing in the kitty, which I do not believe to be the case, there are numerous ways emissions can be reduced without costing the Exchequer or society a penny.<\/p><p>For example, carbon tax can be increased steadily over time and offset by imposing lower taxes on work or funding energy-efficient investments.  This would boost economic growth and employment.  Vehicle registration tax and annual car tax could be further adjusted in a revenue-neutral manner.  Incentives in the agricultural sector in the post-milk quota era could be realigned to focus on climate-smart agriculture.  This would involve a move away from supporting emissions-intensive and loss-making sectors, which are not providing sustainable incomes to farm families in many cases.  Fossil fuel subsidies for peat could be used to support renewable resources that are generated and owned locally.<\/p><p> The committee might not agree with some or any of these policy proposals, but I hope it will agree with my central point that it is not fiscal constraints but political choices, which are made in response to the demands of citizens, that are preventing us from responding to climate change.  This leads to my final question.  How can we bring society and citizens with us?  A key challenge is to change the narrative from one exclusively focused on cost to one that considers benefits and opportunities, particularly for rural Ireland.  It is necessary and possible to socially and rurally proof low-carbon transition.  If we are to socially proof low-carbon transition, we must deal with the negative social impacts of implementing changes to incentives, such as increases in the carbon tax.  There are many approaches to this.  As I have mentioned, we could support energy-efficiency investments in fuel-poor households.  If we are to rural proof low-carbon transition, citizens can and must be incentivised as investors in low-carbon projects in their communities.  It must be possible for these projects to generate local incomes and local wealth.  I refer to projects in areas like on-shore wind, anaerobic digestion, photovoltaic solar, forestry and energy crops.<\/p><p> Low-carbon transition needs space and land in rural Ireland.  Incentives like the renewable heat incentive, which is currently under discussion, and the successor to the feed-in tariff for electricity generation are under consideration.  It is vital that they are designed with local communities and citizen investors in mind, as their preferences and needs are different from those of traditional professional investors.  The mobilisation of local citizens and communities has been achieved in many countries through targeted policy interventions.  For the record, this can be seen on slide 11.  I will spare the committee by not going through it.  While there is a perception that rural Ireland is threatened by low-carbon transition, I suggest it has the most to benefit.  It is possible to have a low-carbon transition that has rural Ireland at its core and is socially just.  It requires an openness to change in society and a willingness to consider new approaches and new sources of income and wealth.  There is a need to sell this narrative to citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Curtin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their contributions.

There was a great deal of discussion on them when the previous committee was drawing up its report on climate action.<\/p> <p>  There is concern that we are stretching the point as we argue that grasslands and forestry have a significant carbon sink value.  The value of peatlands as carbon sinks was not mentioned in the presentations and the documents we received.  One of the other arms of government - the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs - is rightly trying to get on top of the peatlands issue.  I would support the preservation of the peatlands we can preserve.  One of the reasons given by the scientific lobby when it has been making the case for the preservation of our peatlands in recent years has been their value as carbon sinks.  I wonder why that is absent from the presentation we have heard today.<\/p> <p>  There is concern about the figures and the financial implications, even in consideration of the new flexibility we are being given.  It has been suggested that the cost to the State of going off target could extend to &euro;6 billion.  Even though we have just had the warmest year on record, it is not the case that there is unanimous agreement in the Houses of the Oireachtas that climate change is due to human activity.  One or two Members of the House disagree with that.  I am not one of them.  I am not sure whether they have agreed yet that the earth is round.  I would say we are moving in that direction by now.

I have seen changes as I have observed weather patterns throughout my lifetime.

Ireland and other member states are trying to get behind the methodology the Commission used to arrive at the figures, not only as regards flexibilities but also on the cost efficiencies side.  We are not yet 100% certain of the basis the Commission used to give some member states a higher allocation in terms of credits.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that even though we have access to credits from the ETS side, these credits are not free, as we would have to forego revenue that would normally be taken from the auction of these allowances under the ETS scheme.

The flexibility that is on the table is available in respect of these four particular land uses between 2021 and 2030.  The flexibility available is 2.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum.  We estimate that net afforestation will contribute 2.2 million of the 2.7 million tonnes total, with the balance coming from cropland and grassland.  We do not regard afforestation as an offsetting mechanism but as an investment in climate change mitigation.  This will come at a cost, however.

On the granting of access to LULUCF, the Council conclusions of 2014 set out the terms on which the non-ETS targets would be based.  One of the principal targets on which this is built is paragraph 2.1.4 of the Council conclusions, which recognises the low mitigation potential of agriculture, together with the opportunities available in the land-use sector, in particular, in respect of afforestation.  The analysis in the impact study we have seen examined the best means of allowing access to new flexibility in this area.  Principally, our position is that this is not an offset but a means of accessing a new menu of options that was not available to us previously.<\/p><p>For a country like Ireland with a high cost of mitigating carbon, this sets out a new toolbox of options that helps to reduce that cost-effectiveness point for Ireland.<\/p><p> In terms of the LULUCF, afforestation is the key area where we will get most credits.  The LULUCF proposal also acknowledges that those with credits in managed grasslands and managed croplands can also get access to those.<\/p><p> On the managed grassland and cropland, the principal point highlighted is that there must be new and additional activities in those areas.  Therefore, it is not for the existing carbon pool which people identify with in grasslands, but for the new and additional work.  Again we are working closely with Teagasc to see what new and additional opportunities are available.  There are opportunities for better management of grasslands - better fertility of grasslands - to get a carbon credit for grassland.<\/p><p> The same is true of better management of arable silage; it is possible to build up that soil carbon pool.  That is a new and additional activity, as with afforestation.  It is new and additional, over and above the starting point.  That is the principal direction in which we are trying to take this.<\/p><p> Every year the EPA reports to the UNFCCC on peatlands under the wetland category.  It is then up to member states to elect to count for any potential credits.  Again the main point is new and additional credits.  We have not yet reached a stage where we can trust the science of our understanding to prove those new and additional credits.  There are many ongoing research programmes involving the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the NPWS investigating opportunities in that regard.  It can be looked at again in the future.<\/p><p> However, it is not totally excluded because peatland that is under agricultural management is covered by managed grassland or managed cropland.  Approximately 300,000 ha of peatlands are managed grassland.  If we can carry out activities on those that help to manage the water table in those managed grasslands that are peat-soil based, there are potential credits on those.  So there is crossover in how one looks at it.  The principal point to emphasise is that is it new and additional and therefore it is not an offset.  It is not seen to balance against emissions that arise from fertiliser or livestock emissions.  Livestock and fertiliser emissions have their own abatement options and we are also trying to address those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#F02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Muldowney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1287,"content":"<p>Mr. Curtin wanted to address a number of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#G00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1288,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked if forestry could be used as an offset.  Forestry sucks in CO2, and agriculture releases methane and nitrous oxide.  That may be where they are coming from.  As the others said, it is not directly offsetting the emissions produced by agriculture so it cannot really be considered an offset.  Slide 8 shows that even if we were to use all of our flexibility in forestry, there is still an enormous gap to target.  In the more literal sense, even if we were to maximise our forestry sink and maximise our purchase of ETS credits, we still have an enormous potential gap to target based on the current projections which may be on the negative side in terms of economic growth in the period to 2020.  There are many ways in which the Chairman's questions could be interpreted, but that may add something.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley mentioned the costs to 2020.  My analysis considered the costs to 2020 and then to 2030.  There are two aspects to the costs to 2020.  There is the emissions cost and the cost of our renewables targets, both of which are legally binding.  On the emissions target, I took the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or EPA estimates of carbon prices of between five tonnes and ten tonnes to produce a high-end and low-end estimate.

I had to ask a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; it did not indicate a lack of interest in this subject.<\/p> <p>  I read the presentations and saw the briefs and found it all very interesting.  I am not satisfied with the response from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to Deputy Stanley's question.  I am surprised at it.  I would like to get more detail.  As I understand it, most of our political capital in Europe in the past five years was put into getting a good deal in these negotiations.  Did we maintain complete neutrality as to whether peatland would be included in any land-use measure or did it just come at the Commission's own volition?  How did we negotiate on that issue?  I am surprised at the response that the amount of carbon we save on peatlands is uncertain.  There are various academic reports, including a very recent one from Rogier Schulte, formerly of Teagasc and others, showing in some detail that as he advocates it is possible for soil organic carbon or land-use management of wetlands to be a mechanism for carbon emissions reduction.<\/p><p>An earlier paper from O'Reilly and others set out 5.2 million tonnes per annum loss in CO2 equivalent from unmanaged degraded peat wetlands.  I am just perplexed as to why we have accepted this idea.  Has it been finalised and are we ruling out the possibility of using that massive carbon sink, which would surely come at a much lower cost than any of the other afforestation or equivalent options that could be considered?  I am interested to hear in more detail what was our negotiating position on the issue.  Is it closed and if not, can we not consider the option?<\/p><p> I will not get through all the questions.  In one of the papers, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, indicates we are not on target to meet our 2020 targets.  I understand we are only one of two countries - it is us and Luxembourg - that will not meet the targets.  I presume that is why we were given such flexibility on the credit side.  It cannot be a coincidence that Ireland and Luxembourg are the countries with the big credit mechanism, although as Dr. O'Neill indicated, it will cost us.  The EPA figures show us missing the target with two possible missed trajectories.  The first is \"with measures\" and the second is with \"additional\" measures.  I presume we are not taking the option with \"additional\" measures.  It is only in a year or two.  Is that a correct assumption?  Are we doing the additional measures or are we following the blue line demonstrated in the paper?<\/p><p> If we are thinking for the long term about this and moving to 2050, will we get the likely grace of a 9% lowering of our ambition because we argued that we have a particular difficulty making the transition or there is a particular cost problem?  Will that still be there in 2050 or is it expected that it will be massaged out over the course of subsequent decades?  Do the EPA or the others think that as we are signing the Paris Agreement, with an ambition to stay below an increase of 1.5&deg; C, the European 2030 targets set us on that trajectory?  Is it likely, if science is to be our champion in terms of policy approach, that there will be an increase in the likely targets for 2030 at some stage as we continue the ratcheting up of the Paris Agreement for 2020 and beyond?  If Europe is serious about this, do we expect that there will be increased ambition within the European process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#G01400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1301,"content":"<p>The Deputy wished to direct a question to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#H00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>Yes.

In terms of the EPA figures and others, we are constantly monitoring our trajectory against targets.  To summarise the renewables targets, we are about halfway there in our overall renewable energy standard, RES, target, which is legally binding at 16%.  At the end of 2015, we were at about 9.2% of that 16%.  Below the overall RES target of 16%, we have three sub-targets, one of which is the electricity RES, which is a 40% target.  At the end of 2015, we were at slightly more than 25% on that trajectory.  The second sub-target is on heat, RES-H.  The target for 2020 is 12%.  At the end of 2015, we were at just less than 7%.  The final target is in transport, RES-T.  The target is 10% by 2020.  At the end of 2015, we were at 5.7%, which is slightly below 6% for that target.<\/p> <p>  We see renewables, efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions as the three legs of the overall stool of climate change.  We keep our progress under close supervision with regard to how we are getting there.  Senator McDowell referenced onshore wind.  To put it into perspective, of the 2,700 MW of renewable generation capacity that was connected at the end of 2015, about 2,200 MW of that was in onshore wind.  Up to this point, wind has been the most cost-effective technology in terms of delivery.  However, the Senator is correct in saying that there is increasing resistance in many communities to turbines.  We are working very closely with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on how we can respond to those concerns and ensure that we are also doing it in a way that is in compliance with other directives around environmental impact assessment and all of that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator went on to mention Brexit.  While I am not leading our discussions around Brexit, it is clear that energy has a very significant part to play in the overall decisions that we will have to make.  As members are aware, we are highly dependent on the UK, particularly for gas, although with the Corrib gas field having come on line, that dependency is not quite as high as it was.  We also have an east-west interconnector.  Nobody knows at this stage how the Brexit negotiations are going to go.  Many of our arrangements are on a bilateral basis with the UK that pre-date our membership of the EU.  I would see no reason the UK would not honour a lot of those.  At the same time, we as an EU member state need to be mindful in our discussions at EU level.  There is a much greater drive towards what is called regional co-operation.  We are a part of a group I would term the north-western member states that is working collectively on things like offshore energy, grids, ocean energy and other technologies.<\/p> <p>  We in the renewables policy side of the Department are looking at a range of technologies beyond onshore wind.  Indeed, we are already supporting some of them, namely, biomass.  Ocean, offshore and solar energies will all have a part to play.  Like everything else, we just need to watch the cost.  The cost impact to the consumer by way of the public service obligation, PSO, which appears in everybody's bill, and the renewable portion of the costs of the PSO is on the increase.  That is offsetting the fossil fuel imports that we need to take into the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>I will bring in Mr. Curtin next because I know he wants to come in.

I recognise Deputy Dooley's questions and other questions about where we are on our renewable targets.  If we take the current trend, we are not going to get anywhere close to meeting our renewables target.  That is the answer to the Deputy's question.  If we presume a linear extrapolation, we will miss our target by about 3% or maybe slightly more.  If we make a really optimistic assumption and imagine an exponential trend where the line curves upwards, we only miss our target by 1% or 2%.  We are not on target to meet our renewables target.  The main reason for that is the heat sector rather than the electricity sector.  That is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  The key here is how we will build community acceptance and buy-in.  How are going to make sure that our climate policy is socially proofed and community proofed?  What has worked in other countries is to quite simply get communities involved in owning these assets.  Some 50% of renewables in Germany are owned by local communities in Germany and it is approximately the same in Denmark.  Other places like the UK and Ontario are rolling out a whole range of incentives to get communities involved as investors in these technologies.  That is the answer.  The renewable heat incentive is currently on the table and, notwithstanding the fact that we had an energy White Paper that put energy citizens at the very core, it does not mention communities.  It is focused on industrial applications.  I think that no matter what policy proposals we are putting forward, be it a replacement to the feed-in tariff for electricity which is probably not going to be a feed-in tariff but some kind of support mechanism, it has to be focused on getting communities and citizens more involved in low-carbon transition.  That is at the absolute heart of the resistance at the moment to many of these technologies.  As I said, there really is an opportunity here to get communities and citizens more involved.  There are roadmaps to draw upon from many different countries that have done this successfully.  I set some of those out in the last slide of my presentation.  Hopefully, that can inform the debate.  This is the focus of my research in UCC and I would be very happy to come back and talk to the committee in a little bit more detail if it had a further session on this topic.

We have had success with over 250 communities around the country.  We have seen what can happen when communities get together, with support and funding from SEAI, to deliver real action in homes and businesses.  With regard to moving that on, that gets the community involved and thinking about their energy use.  That sets the ground for considering what to do in terms of renewables, which is another related problem, as it were, but must also be tackled.  We are doing some work in the coming months, on behalf of the Department, to examine the different models we have discussed here for how to engage communities in renewable energy projects, be that a benefit fund that they can avail of or opportunities to invest in renewable projects which will take many different forms, and also how to engage communities from the beginning and through the planning stage rather than imposing solutions when, really, it is too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eimear Cotter"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1324,"content":"<p>That is an important part of this debate.

One question that bothers me is how we see joined-up thinking on climate change and reaching our targets.  I was alarmed when I read the EPA report, and I am sorry I missed that presentation.  The report clearly showed that it is estimated we will be between 9% and 14% below targets by 2020.  On the one hand, that is very serious.  On the other hand, I attend sittings of the D&aacute;il and committee meetings and hear, for example, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine boasting about looking forward to having the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada so we can beef up our beef trade with Canada.  In addition, we are delighted that we have just done a big deal for live exports with Egypt.  That does not make sense.  On the one hand we are trying to reach a position where we can reduce our CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions but on the other we are flying ahead with policies that will clearly increase them.  It is farcical to say that one should out-balance the other.  If what the EPA says is true, and I do not doubt that it is, and given that many other organisations have said they are very concerned about the low level of the targets being reached not just here but globally, surely we should take a more proactive approach not just to finding ways to use our land better but also to keeping down our emissions in general.  Every sector in our emissions production should be examined.<\/p><p>I was thinking about buying an electric, carbon-free car.  Very few of them have been bought in this country.  The target is over 5,000, but only approximately 560 were bought up to Christmas last year because they cost a hell of a lot of money.  None of that makes sense.  On the one hand we are saying, &quot;here is this great report and this is how we do it&quot;, but it appears that we are swapping CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions in order to pretend that we are keeping up with our targets.  The reality, and all of the reputable organisations continue to say as much, is that we are hurtling towards a very serious climate disaster if we do not take this seriously.  I do not believe this Government takes it seriously.  It is just shuffling the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>when it does not challenge sectors such as transport and agribusiness in a serious way.  Clearly, transport is a problem.  Every morning cars are bumper to bumper for miles on the M50, with one person in each of the cars.  There are many disused railway lines around that country that we must put back in use.  There should be big investment in getting railway infrastructure in place and improving public transport to take cars off the roads.  I do not see any of this happening.  In fact, recent arguments with bus drivers and current arguments with Bus &Eacute;ireann show that the investment in public transport is going down rather than up.<\/p><p>This is all mad.  One side of the head is thinking a different way from the other side.  There is no joined-up thinking in this Government.  This committee, in some ways, should oversee joined-up thinking if we are to tackle the CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions problem and reach our targets.  Otherwise, these are just lovely reports which are very interesting, but where will they go and where will it all end up?  It is a very serious issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#K00700","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1326,"content":"<p>I will refer that to the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016102500002#K00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1327,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a wide range of issues.

As I mentioned earlier, the key part of that will be trying to align policies within that national plan to ensure that the plan is coherent and is relevant to the targets at EU level and our broad overall commitments under the Paris Agreement.  This is challenging.  There is no getting away from that.  It raises the questions that were raised here earlier.  It will raise questions for the Government in terms of the choices it must make in policies and measures into the future and in terms of the fiscal space, to use that term, with regard to how certain policies and measures get funded to the exclusion, perhaps, of other measures in different sectors that do not get funded, be they in education, health and so forth.

All 28 Heads of State agreed in October 2014 that European policy to 2030 should examine the best means of encouraging sustainable intensification of food production while optimising the sector's contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration, including through afforestation.  How do we respond to demand?  Let us be clear: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations will make it clear where the world population is going as far out as 2050.  That is something of every country has to be cognisant.  Ireland is not going to feed that demand on its own.<\/p> <p>  There is another key aspect to this.  The joint research centre of the European Commission undertook a detailed survey of various agricultural systems throughout the 28 member states.  The survey was published in 2011.  Ireland and Austria were found to have the lowest carbon footprint per kilogram or per litre of product.  We were joint fifth on beef, something we can improve on.  If Ireland opts out of seeking to feed these markets, the gap will be filled.  Will it be filled by a producing country as efficient as the Irish system?  The answer is open to conjecture.

We have set up an environmental sustainability committee that includes the various Departments and agencies that have an involvement.  The aim is to try to monitor and oversee progress on sustainability targets.<\/p> <p>  In the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine significant measures have been put in place under the rural development programme.  These are driving sustainability at farm level.  A sum of &euro;1.4 billion is in place for the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme.  Farmers participate in GLAS to try to encourage better land management and fertiliser use on the farm.  Another headline scheme is the beef data and genomics programme to try to drive down the emissions intensity of our beef herd.  The average beef herd owner in Ireland is no rancher; the average herd is 14 cows.  This is the type of farming system we are trying to foster in the rural landscape in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  People might argue about the merits of growing more cereals or more arable production, but that would be at the cost of our significant carbon pool in the grasslands.  The average carbon pool per hectare in grasslands is approximately 200 tonnes.  In tillage, the corresponding figure is 50 tonnes.  That will be released over a number of years if we convert to that type of land use.  Again, there is the question of balance in all of this.

The committee will be aware that the Centre for Cross Border Studies was established in 1999 to support and promote cross-Border co-operation on the island in the context of the imperative for cross-border co-operation embedded in the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the areas where such co-operation can lead to positive outcomes for the two jurisdictions on the island is economic development.  This is also an area that will face significant challenges in light of the outcome of the UK's membership of the European Union, in regard to which we may not have too many solutions today but some issues to raise.<\/p> <p>  The magnitude of the challenges will depend on the nature of the UK's post-Brexit relations with the EU and the extent to which Ireland's specific needs can be accommodated by the Commission and the other 26 member states, as well as the Irish economy's capacity to reorientate its exports focus from the UK market.  The importance of the British market specifically to the economies of both parts of this island is such that any significant downturn in consumer confidence in that market arising from Brexit will have negative impacts North and South, including job losses.  We have already witnessed the closure of several agrifood businesses this side of the Border due to the steep fall in the value of sterling in the wake of the referendum result.  It is to be welcomed, therefore, that the Irish Government has identified the risks posed by Brexit to the economy, trade and investment and that its contingency planning includes the proposed introduction of measures to develop market diversification and strategies to tackle variations in the value of sterling.<\/p> <p>  Given our organisational focus, the centre notes in particular the Irish Government's inclusion of the need to monitor closely the impact of the UK's decision to leave on enterprise and trade in the Border counties, that how Border counties may be affected by a prolonged sterling devaluation will receive special consideration and that the relevant regional action plans for jobs will be revised accordingly.<\/p><p>Whereas Brexit will have consequences for the wider economies in both jurisdictions, it will perhaps be in the counties immediately North and South of the Border where we will witness the true nature of the post-Brexit environment in which businesses and those involved in economic development will have to operate.  <\/p><p> In view of our particular focus, I would like to simply identify three challenges that the post-Brexit environment is likely to pose specifically for cross-Border economic activity and collaboration.  These challenges, which we can discuss in further detail if members wish, assume that the UK does not opt to retain access to the EU's internal market and, therefore, will no longer be bound to accept the principle of freedom of movement of EU citizens.  Currently, both the public and private sectors have the ability to widen their pool of labour and skills to include both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland.  While there is no definitive data on the number of commuters who cross the Ireland-Northern Ireland Border to work, based on the available estimates, we think somewhere between 23,000 and 30,000 people are cross-Border workers.  The UK's exit from the EU, particularly if the UK does not retain access to the Single Market, could have significant impacts on the situation of these cross-Border workers and on the continuing ability of businesses to employ workers from across the Border.  We run an information services for cross-Border commuters and the number of hits on that website on 24 June was double its daily average for the previous month.  There are a lot of worried cross-Border workers and commuters.  It could have a real impact on employers' ability to employ workers from the other side of the Border.  The current body of cross-Border workers also includes quite a significant minority of people who are EU citizens but not citizens of the UK or Ireland.  This raises all sorts of issues, whatever the result of the negotiations, around some version of a common travel area might be.  <\/p><p> The imposition of customs controls will not only have obvious consequences for businesses involved in cross-Border trade but will also reduce the effectiveness and even viability of all-island supply chains.  This is something about which many businesses would be concerned, particularly those within the agrifood sector.  All-island supply chains may also have to face the possibility of policy divergences between the two jurisdictions in areas such as animal health, plant health, food labelling, state aids, competitiveness and veterinary restrictions.  The risk these challenges pose is that in some cases, supply chains will be shortened to within the confines of one jurisdiction with the consequent loss of economic activity to the other jurisdiction and the island.  <\/p><p> Policy divergences and the loss of access to relevant EU funds for businesses and research institutions in Northern Ireland will also create additional difficulties in the area of innovation.  This would also apply to universities, which I know are very concerned.  A 2013 OECD study on cross-Border collaboration in innovation noted that the all-island dimension would be the most profitable way for both jurisdictions to support innovation and enterprise.  However, Brexit could disrupt the potential for all-island co-operation in innovation and thereby undermine the ability of businesses to increase their competitiveness and bring new products to market.  These are just some of the challenges that Brexit presents us with and they are certainly ones that apply to this committee.  A collective failure to rise to those challenges risks an insularity that is fatal to economic development and that is particularly detrimental to a Border region that is already peripheral in the pre-Brexit context<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ruth Taillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1343,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Taillon for her presentation.

It is a privilege for the institute and for me personally to address the committee.  As a small country, strong rules-based arrangements with our neighbours are an eternal Irish interest.  For more than four decades, the EU has provided such an arrangement with our closest neighbours.  The departure of the UK from the Continent's most important political and economic institutions will bring to an end to a period in which the external environment has been as close to ideal for this State as could ever realistically be imagined in international affairs.  Brexit will result in Ireland being pulled between the State's closest neighbour and the continent which is vital for our prosperity.  The consequences are multiple, almost all of which are negative, not least for employment.  Even if the opportunities are maximised, they will only partially offset the damage caused by the others. <\/p> <p>  I will focus on three issues in these opening remarks: currency, trade and investment.  Irish exporters, and in particular indigenous Irish exporters, watch the euro-sterling exchange rate very closely because an adverse movement can wipe out their profits and threaten their businesses, as has happened to some companies already.  Many things determine exchange rates but over the longer term, the economic outlook of an economy is among the most important factors.  As there is overwhelming agreement among economists that Brexit will be bad for the British economy, the fall in sterling since the June referendum is unlikely to be reversed over the foreseeable future.  This will make Irish made goods and services more expensive in the UK and require even more effort by businesses here to cut costs and remain competitive.  This will negatively effect Irish employment levels and the only real question is by how much. <\/p> <p>  Brexit will reduce Ireland-UK bilateral trade over the longer term.  Again, the only real question is by how much.  Economists are almost universal in their agreement that the more barriers that exist to doing business, the less business that ends up being done.  The UK's departure from the EU will mean new barriers to cross-Border commerce between the EU and the UK.  If, as is increasingly likely, the UK leaves the single market when it leaves the EU, these new barriers will be considerable.  This will impact much more on Ireland more than the other remaining 27 EU member countries, something illustrated by the relative importance of Irish trade with the UK.  In 2014, before a very significant revision of Irish GDP, the value of Irish goods and services exports to the UK amounted to 17% of Irish GDP.  This was the second highest among the EU-27 in respect of exports to the UK.  For most other EU countries, exports to the UK  are in low single digits relative to GDP.  If Brexit was to result in a one-quarter decline in Irish exports to the UK, it would cause a very sharp slowdown in the economy here.  If the economy was already growing slowly when the impact is felt, a recession would be all but inevitable. <\/p> <p>  Brexit will cause companies to change their investment decisions.  This will result in both Irish jobs moving to the UK and British jobs moving to Ireland.  Among the most traditional motivations for foreign direct investment is to jump over trade barriers that exist between countries.  Rather than exporting from, for example, the US to Europe and paying tariffs, US companies over the decades have set up subsidiaries on this side of the Atlantic.  This has allowed them to service European markets while avoiding costly tariffs.   The higher the new barriers to trade between the UK and Ireland are after Brexit, the more likely it is that companies based in Ireland that service the UK market will have reason to relocate at least part of their operations into the UK.  Such barrier jumping will lead to job losses in Ireland.  Yet again, the only real question is how many.<\/p> <p>  However, jumping trade barriers works both ways.  While Ireland stands to lose some jobs, it also stands to gain jobs from the UK as a result of Brexit.  This is the only real upside for Ireland from the UK departing the EU.  There are two broad potential sources of jobs.  They are British companies that service the EU market and foreign companies in the UK that service the same market.  As the UK has the second highest stock foreign direct investment in the world and much of that investment is EU-focused, there are considerable opportunities for Ireland.  Both types of companies are likely to look to Ireland as an EU location into which investment and jobs can moved to secure Single Market access.<\/p> <p>  There are many other dimensions to Brexit that will be damaging to Irish economic interests.  For instance, it is likely to make the EU less open to the world, something of particular concern to Ireland given its unique place in the transatlantic economy.  It is also very likely to make the EU less liberal internally.  The loss of a large partner with similar interests and perspectives on many economic policy matters will make the EU a less comfortable place for Ireland. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, despite the opportunity to attract jobs from the UK, the other foreseeable changes flowing from Brexit are negative for the Irish economy and employment.  The net costs, if indeed the UK does leave, will be large and felt over the very long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1345,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for his presentation.

Even before the referendum on UK exit from the EU took place in June, the impact on Ireland of a possible \"Out\" vote was being analysed at the ESRI with an initial scoping study published in November of last year as part of a joint research programme with the Department of Finance.  This covered the areas where the most significant economic implications would be expected - trade, foreign direct investment, energy markets and labour movement - and pointed to the important issues to be assessed in more detail.<\/p><p>In the aftermath of the result, these topics are being investigated in greater depth reflecting the very considerable risks that Brexit brings to the Irish economy.  Given the focus of this committee on jobs and enterprise, I will concentrate my comments on the trade and foreign direct investment, FDI, effects.<\/p><p> It is important to emphasise before discussing any particular issues that there is considerable uncertainty about the path that a UK exit from the EU might take and the nature of the relationship between the UK and EU that will replace full membership.  Projections about the impact on Ireland can have quite wide ranges depending on the assumptions made about the exit negotiations and subsequent agreements on trade and migration.  Already, before negotiations have even begun, we are seeing a negative impact on Irish exporters to the UK due to exchange rate movements.  Whether these are short-term reactions to the uncertainty generated by Brexit or a more permanent adjustment in currency levels is too early to call. <\/p><p> Access to the EU market for non-members can take a number of forms ranging from free trade deals like European Free Trade Association, EFTA, to an individually negotiated deal such as the one currently being finalised between the EU and Canada to a more complete form of exit resulting in the application of the tariff schedule that the EU applies to non-members without a specific trade agreement under the World Trade Organization, WTO, rules.<\/p><p> Of these three broad scenarios, the EFTA model, which exists between the EU and countries like Norway and Switzerland, would have the most modest effect on trade as it is the closest in form to full EU membership.  However, as this comes with significant obligations in the form of contributions to the EU budget and freedom of movement, the political feasibility of this option in the UK is open to doubt.  An individually negotiated Canadian-style deal may be the most likely in the longer run but will be extremely challenging to have completed by the exit date of March 2019.  This leaves the fall-back position, at least temporarily, of WTO tariffs being implemented on EU-UK trade.  These would have considerable negative impacts on EU-UK trade overall and this effect would be particularly large for Ireland.  <\/p><p> On average, the WTO tariff rates may not appear particularly onerous but the variation is considerable and, as a result, a WTO arrangement would impact trade quite differently across the current EU member states and across different sectors within each country.  More than 5,000 individual products are listed with the WTO and tariffs applied by the EU on non-members without a specific trade deal range from 0% to 80%.  To give an example of particular relevance to Irish trade, the tariff on fresh or chilled boneless bovine meat is 12.8% of the value of the product plus &euro;303 per 100 kg shipped. <\/p><p> Our estimates suggest that Brexit is likely to reduce bilateral trade flows between Ireland and the UK by 20% or more.  A more detailed look at the differing WTO tariffs by product type shows how unevenly spread these negative effects would be.  Given the current structure of trade between the UK and EU, an application of WTO tariff rates on exports from the EU to the UK would result in an average tariff of 5.7%.  The tariff on Irish exports however would be almost double this at 11.7%.  The reason for this is that the tariffs are consistently higher on agricultural and food exports, which account for a much higher share of Irish trade with the UK compared to the trade of other countries. <\/p><p> Sectors such as agriculture and food would be most severely affected, both because the tariff rates on these sectors are higher and because these sectors tend to be more reliant on the UK as a main export destination.  To give another example, average tariffs on meat exports are close to 50% and this sector accounts for 8% of Irish trade with the UK compared to 1.6% of total EU trade with the UK.  On the other hand, some sectors such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals, which make up a large share of Irish trade with the UK, would face relatively modest tariffs.  This variation across sectors, and therefore EU member states, will be important in the negotiation of a new trade agreement as there will be significant divergence in the priority areas of the 27 remaining countries.  Encouraging greater diversification across export markets will be critical in mitigating this risk to Irish exporters. <\/p><p> In addition to the impact on exports, there are important implications for imports.  The share of merchandise imports to Ireland originating in the UK is greater than the share of Irish merchandise exports destined to the UK.  This is due to the heavy reliance of Ireland on energy imports from the UK, mainly natural gas and fuels, and also retail products.  Importantly, UK retailers have a very significant presence in the Irish market and many products in the Irish retail market are supplied through UK based wholesalers, as the Irish market is relatively small.  Trade barriers could result in higher prices and thus have an inflationary impact. <\/p><p> On a somewhat more positive note, there is an opportunity for Ireland to build further on its favourable reputation as a location for FDI in the wake of Brexit.  The UK is likely to be less attractive to FDI because of the uncertainty of the Brexit process and reduced access to the EU Single Market once the exit is complete.  The activities of the financial sector have been raised as a major issue for post-Brexit negotiations with the EU as current passporting arrangements to give financial firms in any member state the right to do business in any other member state would be in question.  The loss of, or restrictions on, these rights could result in some firms deciding to move operations out of the UK.  Some of this FDI may be attracted to locate in Ireland if access to the EU market is an important consideration.  This upside should not be overstated however.  The size of the UK&rsquo;s domestic market will still make it an attractive location for some FDI projects and, for those that do decide to go to a different European destination, Ireland will have to compete with a number of other potential locations.  Continuing the Government's strategy of low corporate tax rates and the cultivation of a business friendly environment will be key to maximising this potential positive dimension of Brexit, as would addressing any infrastructural deficits that might constrain firms interested in locating or expanding in Ireland. <\/p><p> One final important issue to which to draw attention regarding comparing the negative trade effects of Brexit with the potential FDI gain is that, even in the fairly unlikely scenario that the aggregate effects of these two impacts balance out, the timing and distribution of the effects are likely to be very different.  The trade fall will have an immediate impact with potentially large negative employment effects disproportionately affecting Irish-owned small and medium enterprise exporters.  Given that food exports are particularly vulnerable, the impact is likely to be hardest felt in more rural areas.  On the other hand, the benefits of an increase in FDI are likely to take much longer to become apparent - firms may start to divert some new investments but not to reduce their current UK plants or to wind them down only gradually.  There is also the possibility that if a large share of the diverted FDI is in financial services, it will be drawn to locate in larger urban centres leading to increases in regional disparity.  <\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention and we are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Lawless","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1348,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lawless for her presentation.

One of the reasons I did not mention mitigation is that it is very difficult to do much to mitigate this.  We are a small country.  It will be extremely difficult for us to do anything about whatever changes come about.  As my colleague said before we came in, the best mitigation is to have no Brexit.  That brings me to the Deputy's second question.  I think everyone agrees, even the pro-Brexit people in UK, that this would be an enormously complex operation; to take a country out of the EU and unscramble all of the eggs that have been scrambled over the past 40 years and have a completely new arrangement with the EU is an unprecedented thing to do.  The falling back on the WTO position is also uncertain because of the nature of the WTO and the uncertainty and unprecedented nature of an EU member state which is a member of the WTO but whose membership has only been in the context of EU membership for so long.  It is even unclear how that option would play out for Britain, given the complexity of that and the economic costs, which will become more apparent as the months passed and as the Article 50 process takes place over the next few years.  We can also take a reading of UK domestic politics in terms of interest groups, which did not run a very good remain campaign.<\/p><p>As happened here after the referenda on the Lisbon and Nice treaties, the second time around interest groups ran much better information campaigns when they realised just how big the consequences would be.  There are also the regional constitutional dynamics within the UK.  It would be easy to foresee, two years down the line, a situation whereby, due to their sheer complexity, the negotiations run into the ground, the costs of leaving become much more apparent to British public opinion and momentum grows for a second referendum either to reverse the result of the first or to have a vote on the actual exit options that are agreed, namely, either to stay in or to accept the options.  There is quite a high probability that it will not happen at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>Does anybody else want to take up that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>On how we should plan and what our contingency is, certain things are possible including how well we work together.  For example, the conversation at national level needs to involve the public sector, Government officials, the private sector and civic society.  The structures to run the conversation will be quite important.  As has been alluded to and as everybody knows, this is a massively complex series of matters for us all to consider in the weeks, months and years ahead.  It is not like anything else that has been done in recent times and, therefore, thinking about how we will have the conversations necessary to source information, to inform negotiators, to feed back, to test scenarios, to get impact analyses, etc. will be very important.  Now would be a good time to think about the structures for those conversations.<\/p> <p>  As an example of one of the myriad line items that will come forward, in the education sector there is a significant opportunity now for Ireland to think about the loss of EU-funded research currently done through UK universities - including universities in Northern Ireland - which are at risk of losing significant funding straightaway rather than in time as a result of what has been determined in the referendum.  Those universities have an opportunity to partner with other universities so that the opportunities are not totally lost.  There is a strategic opportunity for Ireland to think how Irish universities might pick up some of that very valuable work.  That is not without many operational issues and concerns, but now is a good time to run the scenario planning over what it might entail, how it might work and who would need to work with whom both in the sector itself and in other areas surrounding the sector.  The Cassels report on how the university sector is funded in the long term suddenly takes on a new importance because there is no point in us telling the world we are open for new research business in universities whose future funding base is not yet assured.<\/p> <p>  All of that speaks to a national strategic approach to dealing with the short-term, immediate great burdens on exporters, for instance, but also beginning to think in the medium and long term about a change of regime for this country that is as big as when we joined the EU or indeed when we gained independence.  This is a massive project and we need massive project management to deal with it very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McGrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>I would like to pick up on those points as well.  On the issue of the UK not leaving, Mr. O'Brien is right in pointing out that this is a very complex area and when the implications are clear to people, they may change their minds.  However, there is also a danger that the negotiations when they start, because they are so wound up in detail, could be quite acrimonious.  In fact, we could by accident end up with no agreement and default to a WTO situation.  There is considerable scope for things to go one way or the other.<\/p> <p>  The scope for mitigation is limited but there are opportunities, as we have already pointed out, for example in the area of FDI.  There are also opportunities in the area of education as Mr. McGrane has pointed out.  There is scope for Ireland to attract additional students, on which the UK seems to be changing its mind.  In the past it has been very strong at attracting highly talented students from around the world.  Those could potentially be attracted to Ireland, which would be an obvious benefit to us.<\/p> <p>  We know from the data that SMEs are much more exposed to the UK market, with a greater share of their exports going there.  They tend to operate in sectors that are likely to be more affected.  There is some scope for policy to help them diversify their markets to help reduce that effect.  There is a little bit of time to play at this point.  We do not have a Brexit yet; it will be two years and a bit if it is going to happen.

We need to be careful with that opportunity because, as has been mentioned, Ireland will also be competing with other EU member states to try to attract FDI that is either being invested in the UK already or that is planned to invest in the UK.  In competing with other EU states, we need to be careful that it is not a race to the bottom in trying to attract that FDI.  I agree that this is an opportunity for investing in higher education to increase universities' capacity to drive innovation in the economy.  There are opportunities to draw down EU funds precisely for the purpose of innovation within universities, and also for universities linked with SMEs in particular, on which the EU is extremely keen.  There may be opportunities there.<\/p> <p>  I totally agree with having a national, cross-sectoral conversation involving business and civic society as well as the public sector and Government.  That cross-sectoral conversation is needed in order to avoid the possibility of a race to the bottom or seizing opportunities which end up affecting certain sectors thereby increasing economic disparities.  It is particularly important that this cross-sectoral conversation happens.<\/p> <p>  On the urban-rural dimension, a recent Department of Finance report indicated a large proportion of jobs in four of the five sectors most exposed by the consequences of the UK's decision to leave the EU are in the Border region and in rural areas more generally.

We can take mitigation action on two different levels.  At the level of the negotiation with the UK, obviously Ireland will be represented as part of the EU.  A strong priority there should be to have the relationship remain as close as possible and try to avoid any acrimonious disputes.  It would be better for Ireland to maintain the maximum level of integration of the UK with the EU.  I agree with Mr. O'Brien that Brexit may not be 100% guaranteed but that it is most likely.  We certainly need to avoid the hard Brexit scenario and the WTO default by conducting the negotiations in the closest way possible.<\/p> <p>  There is exposure for Irish-owned SMEs and, in particular, those in food and smaller products.  There is still a role for policy to encourage greater diversification of these firms to a wider range of export markets and to do the latter at as early a stage as possible in order to make big firms aware of a wider range of export opportunities.<\/p><p>Wider export diversification is probably a positive thing for these SMEs in any event because over-reliance on a single market, particularly one with a different currency is always going to be slightly risky.

On the assumption that we will have some version of Brexit, hopefully we will not but it looks increasingly likely, one thing the Irish Government could do in the diplomatic discussions is consider the particular impact of the loss of EU funding, not just in economic terms but in terms of the isolation factor, of having our links to our European neighbours cut off.  We were considering some of the possibilities for potential replacement funding streams or ways to go about this.  It depends very much on the UK Government's attitude to putting money into the budgets.  The European neighbourhood partnership initiative has been shaped very much like a Brexit for external borders.  That could have great potential if the UK and Ireland came together and set up a programme which not only allowed us to co-operate with Wales, as the southern side of the Border has done with an EU initiative for inter-regional co-operation, INTERREG, programme.  We have been able to bring Scotland in to work with the rest of the island.  Given the new circumstances and the political upheaval we would like to have some version of a programme that allowed us to reach out to other sectors of the UK.  INTERREG in particular has been innovative and allowed the universities get in.  There has also been the peace programme.  If there was some way of keeping the Horizon 2020 and the financial instrument supporting environmental, nature conservation and climate action projects throughout the EU, the LIFE programmes going between these islands could be very important for us, whichever way Brexit goes.  We are considering it from the point of view of the social impact, on jobs and so on, and of the relationships we will lose through being cut off from EU civic society networks.

Enterprise Ireland and others do very good work in this area.<\/p> <p>  A total of 40% of the exports of our indigenous exporting firms goes to the UK.  That is significantly more than the exports of our international foreign direct investor friends who export only 16% to the UK.  Those indigenous firms are in many cases family businesses, not only in the urban metropolitan areas but all around the country.  Those indigenous firms create more new jobs in the economy annually than foreign direct investment firms.  They are very important at every level.  Encouraging them to diversify their markets, to open up new lines of sales into France, Germany or China, for example, is good advice but it is extremely difficult for the firms involved to put into effect at any kind of reasonable pace.  That takes a long time to do.  Ireland exports less to the UK now than it did 20 years ago as a proportion of our total exports but that is because we have been very good at developing other lines of business more globally, including with the help of our EU membership.  It is not realistic to think that many Irish firms can simply switch to other markets.  In the short term the solutions are hard work for some of those firms, they have to concentrate on being more innovative to find other ways to reduce their costs.  Some will need to respond by thinking about moving some of their cost base to a sterling cost base.  In the simplest terms, a call centre in Dundalk has the operational choice to unplug the phones in Dundalk and move them to Newry.  That is not a facile example because a call centre works on margins of less than 15%, which are pretty good margins but the currency has slipped by 17% so those call centres are losing money and they need to think about their options to save the business and such jobs in Ireland as they can save by diversifying into the sterling area.<\/p> <p>  Some of the firms that rely on exports to the UK can be helped to stomach the reduction in the unit value of their sales to the UK because of sterling collapse by opening up additional sales into the UK.  That is slightly counterintuitive but they may be able to compensate for reduced unit margins by increasing overall volume, depending on other factors in their cost formula.

Therefore, it is a question of tactical flexibility after the invocation of Article 50 at diplomatic and Government levels.  It will be about looking at specific issues and prioritising issues.

A number of issues could arise.  IDA Ireland has always had a regional balance objective as part of its work in attracting FDI and in its negotiation with FDI companies.  Given that we see the trade impact falling heavily on rural areas, perhaps these efforts need to be redoubled.  Perhaps IDA Ireland needs to ensure that any additional FDI is reasonably balanced and to try to compensate areas that are hard-hit by the negative trade effects.<\/p> <p>  More generally, there are issues of capacity.  Even in Dublin, there are issues with office space, residential space and broadband structure.  If we were to go after a large increase in once-off FDI that might be relocating from the UK to Ireland, then it is important that the capacity is in place in terms of physical infrastructure and links with the university sector, a point to which Mr. McGrane has adverted.  Other relevant factors include human capital or labour availability for FDI companies to maximise whatever potential gains exist for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  This applies to financial companies in particular but also to FDI companies more generally looking to move from the UK and perhaps those no longer considering the UK as a location.  Some companies may be deciding to move somewhere else in Europe.  We need to have Ireland at the forefront of alternative locations.<\/p> <p>  FDI companies coming from the United States may have been looking at the UK or Ireland as a location because of language, education and cultural similarities.  Ireland is well placed to get a share of any relocated FDI, but it is important to continue all the Government policies that make Ireland an attractive location.  Ireland has always had a disproportionate amount of FDI facilities relative to other European countries because of our business environment, language, education facilities and so on.  It is important that we are not held back from taking the greatest possible advantage of the opportunities by not having the capacity in place in the areas where companies are considering relocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Lawless"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1372,"content":"<p>I have a follow-up question.

They are claiming their locations as the best alternative locations for UK businesses and agencies that now have a business need and a franchise need to find an assured base inside the European Union.<\/p><p>Nationally, we were shy about this in the early weeks post referendum, but people now understand clearly that there is a need, not necessarily to exit, but to find additional bases inside the EU and that it is legitimate for Ireland to present itself as the best alternative or additional home for such businesses.

A common strand in this discussion is that of a national strategic approach, even prior to knowing all of the detail.  We should have a national strategic approach to this matter more widely to determine whether we are ready for the next phase of Irish national development.  It would be applied to questions about, for example, what the Government has done to address housing capacity issues, ensure that office space comes on stream without delay, introduce baccalaureate programmes for international students and schools and, critically, ensure beyond any ambiguity that the financial services regulator is not in the marketing business, but the supporting business in respect of an industry that is set to expand significantly on the back of some of these developments.<\/p><p> It is important that we be ready for Brexit in Dublin and the regions.

I will address two issues.  I will admit that I have not thought about the Common Fisheries Policy, so I cannot comment on it.  Regarding jobs, something that does not get enough attention is the question of small and medium-sized British companies of 200 or 300 people that export into the EU.  They are a potential target and may wish to move a part of their operations into the EU.  There tends to be a major focus on finance and the large multinationals that we have traditionally got, but there is a considerable opportunity in respect of small to medium-sized export-focused British companies that depend on the EU market, in that they will be interested in jumping over barriers, avoiding customs problems and moving.  A British company that is not a multinational already will not be used to working in another country, so coming to a common law jurisdiction where English is spoken would be particularly attractive to a 200-person British company.  Even more than the Netherlands, Ireland is by far the most obvious place.<\/p> <p>  On a slightly less negative note, the WTO mechanism has a liberalisation bias.  One can unilaterally cut tariffs, but one cannot unilaterally increase them.  In the 1830s and the early days of the industrial revolution, Britain decided to opt for a cheap food policy.  At the time, there was a large debate in Britain about what it should do with tariffs.  It went down the cheap food route.  Dr. Lawless discussed how high the tariffs could be, but it could also go the other way and Britain might decide to opt for a cheap food policy and cut tariffs for everyone.  There would be many complexities involved in reaching that point, but if Britain leaves the customs union when it leaves the Single Market, which seems likely, it will be in a position to reduce tariffs on goods and services unilaterally.  In particular, it could choose a cheap food policy as a way of mitigating the other costs of Brexit.  The cost of New Zealand dairy and Latin American meat relative to the prices in Europe is much lower.  That would pose an even greater, perhaps even existential - it is an overused word - challenge to the food industry in Ireland, given the importance to it of the UK market.  It could present an even larger risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1379,"content":"<p>I mentioned the potential to attract students to the third level sector.

Mutterings around immigration might make people reconsider the UK as a potential location, so there is clearly an opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Picking up some of the UK's lost market share in Europe may be more difficult.  Ireland exports a great deal of food product into the UK, but the UK does not export a great deal of food product into the rest of the EU.  There will not be a large market to be gained.  There will be considerable action in the negotiations around the car industry. The car industry is the top merchandise exporter in approximately 20 of the EU's 28 current member states and the supply chain linkages are extreme.  Ireland does not have a significant presence in that market.  There are some firms, but not many.  There is probably little opportunity in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There may be scope in the engineering sector, in which respect the UK is still strong.  Opportunities could be pursued and the enterprise agencies are well placed to identify and take proactive measures in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I must also admit that I do not know much about fisheries.

Business has a political element and it responds practically right away to the circumstances.  I can give a characterised example around an Irish project management firm working with a UK construction firm.  The UK construction firm is seeing a fall-off in local demand for major projects, including civil and other elements.  Arising from that firm's scale in the UK, it also has the ability to perhaps contract for business in the Middle East.  Both of those firms are now working together in the Middle East on contracts outside the EU.  They already have a successful partnership and they both responded to uncertainty and reduced demand in the near market by travelling further afield together.  I would not underestimate the inventiveness and skill level of many of our great businesses in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The UK gets 53% of its imports from the EU, which is a very substantial amount of product coming into the UK from EU countries, the greater part of which is not from Ireland by definition but from other EU countries.  There will be very good opportunities for Irish businesses who establish a base inside the UK to replace some of that EU import business in areas where we have a competence..  There are many ripple effects from what has been happening already.  For Irish businesses that are ambitious, reasonably funded and intent on building good relationships to extend their businesses, there are opportunities to work inside the still very large UK market of 60 million people to pick up the business the UK will still need to be provided for, to replaces others who may lose that business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McGrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1381,"content":"<p>This comment may be beyond the remit of the committee but as the Centre for Cross Border Studies, the nature of our organisation means we work on both sides of the Border, in both jurisdictions, and we also work within an east-west relationship.

The organisation has more than 210 affiliated organisations, which work on issues ranging from unemployment and community development to disability, Traveller and other issues, and over 2,000 individual members.  They are people who are either unemployed, some in receipt of a payment and others not, or are on a variety of working age payments.  The organisation works on providing training and welfare rights information services, analysis of Government policies and related advocacy work, and works with a range of other organisations on issues of common concern.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious that all the headline statistics are moving in the right direction.  There is an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.  However, we are keenly aware, from feedback from individual members and affiliated organisations and from our other work, that many people are not experiencing this improvement.  Looking at the breakdown between full-time and part-time employment now and the pre-crisis period equivalent, when employment was at its highest level, it is striking to see that 82% of people were in full-time employment before the crisis while the current figure is 77%.  The feedback we get from affiliates and individual members indicates that in their area or line of work, much of the work on offer or available to them is often part-time or piecemeal.  That is an issue of concern.  Given the debate and uncertainty around Brexit, people feel this could be exacerbated in the coming period.<\/p> <p>  One statistic one always wishes to bring to people's attention is the potential additional labour force.  It captures the number of people who have not answered in the affirmative to the two questions one must answer in the affirmative to be classified as unemployed.  One question is whether the person has been actively seeking work in the past four weeks and the second is whether the person is available to take up work in the next two weeks.  If one has not been looking for work because one has lost heart, one will answer \"No\" to the first question.  If there are child care, transport or other logistical issues to be resolved, one might not be able to take up work within a two-week timeframe so one might answer \"No\" to the second.  A person might answer \"No\" to both questions.  The potential additional labour force stands at approximately 40,000 people.  It is a figure to bear in mind, because it often denotes people who are more distant from the labour market or have other challenges that must be addressed.  Among the challenges, as the Oireachtas is keenly aware, are issues with child care and transport.  They are considerable issues in rural areas but they are also issues in urban areas of disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  The striking aspect of the debate about Brexit and the reality of Ireland's trading position is the fact that Britain is still such a huge trading partner for Ireland.  Even though the percentage is down, the income generated and the value of the exports still amount to considerable sums of money.  The challenge facing Ireland is how to preserve that or, if that is not achievable depending on the nature of the Brexit, how to substitute for it.  How do we plan for that and what must we do to ensure that happens?  One of the striking features of some of the reports Enterprise Ireland has produced is that it is usually the firms that were more open to being innovative and co-operative that often had the better results and better employment results.  We note that because many of the changes that have taken place in employment services, education and training services and in activation supports and policy do not lend themselves to innovation or co-operation across a range of providers.  Being innovative and collaborative in the approach to public policy making and the roll-out of services will be critical to trying to address the challenges we currently face and are likely to face as Brexit is rolled out, if there is to be a positive result.<\/p> <p>  Most of our concerns are around the impacts on people who are unemployed or people who could be facing unemployment.  For a long period of time this State has relied on emigration as a safety valve for unemployment.  Even though Irish people travel to all parts of the planet, the main outlet for our people is often the country next door.  That will be a consideration, depending on the nature of the Brexit we face.  From our perspective, we would like to have a very good analysis of enterprises and jobs, the assessment of those that will survive, manage or thrive and, for those that will not, how to plan for their employees either creating their own jobs in a different enterprise or being able to seek employment elsewhere.  How do we map out those journeys for all those people who could number many thousands?  One exercise we must undertake as a nation is to examine how to address that.  In the meantime, we must not lose sight of those who remain unemployed.  Among the feedback we receive is feedback from people who are older and unemployed.  They find that although many of them might have good skills and experience, getting back into work once one is beyond a certain age is very difficult.  As one individual said to us, being unemployed, over 50 and living in rural Ireland is no joke.  Many people living in urban disadvantaged areas would echo that sentiment.<\/p> <p>  As we plan for the potential negative impact of Brexit, and perhaps for the opportunities it will throw up, and try to ensure that those who are unemployed or become unemployed are not left behind as these developments take place, we must build services that have the capacity to ensure that we do not lose sight of the issues and inequalities currently in our labour market for those who might be facing structural unemployment, long-term unemployment or who come from families and communities where it has been a while since anybody has been in work.  How to address that is among the challenges that face us.  Also, when rolling out plans such as the Action Plan for Education and the Action Plan for Jobs, how do we ensure that those policies are truly equitable and inclusive and that we plan in a way that does not leave others behind?  It should be borne in mind that even at the height of the Celtic tiger economy many people were left behind, with many people in jobless households.  They were in particular communities and came from particular backgrounds.  We must ensure that does not happen again.<\/p> <p>  We believe it is important that there is good planning and good cross-agency and cross-departmental co-operation and interaction.  We must get a good handle on it and plan it out well, and ensure that the supports and services for unemployed people are meaningful, well informed, good and proactive whereby people can feel that they can make an informed choice and have a secure future in Ireland.  One of our concerns about the recent budget is that in many respects no additional resources were put into some of the educational and other supports unemployed people access.  Depending on the nature of the Brexit that takes place, ensuring that there are alternative education and training supports and that they have the capacity to engage with those who are unemployed or are likely to become unemployed will be critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1477411200,"counter":1388,"content":"<p>Thank you.

My colleague, Mr. Paul McFlynn, who is Belfast-based, cannot be here today.  I will speak briefly about the issues of jobs, employment and trade, which have been highlighted in the document presented jointly with the ICTU.  This very much reflects our thinking and analysis at the moment of the risks, as well as the opportunities, in respect of economic matters.<\/p> <p>  The first key point is that we need to diagnose the scale of the problem and the scale of risks.  Some analysis has been undertaken by the Department of Finance on sectors of manufacturing that are vulnerable.  That includes agrifood and many other sectors.  Perhaps surprisingly, the pharmaceutical industry, which is not generally Irish owned, is also vulnerable because of the extent of its trade links with the UK.  There is also the issue of energy, as we are reliant on imports of oil and gas from the UK.  In so far as the Government is in a position to begin to respond to some of these challenges, it is vital that we know the scale of risks and problems, and that we map the extent of exposure and risks across the sectors.  There could very well be a role for many actors, including employers, unions and Government, to assess what needs to be done in the short term in particular, if there is a risk of redundancies and firm closures.<\/p> <p>  The second key point is the important of retraining and equipping workers at risk of redundancy.  There is surely a role here for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has been successful to some degree in respect of transitions in the past.  Brexit is potentially a major shock to the labour market, especially in particular regions.  My sense is that the Republic may well gain in areas such as financial services but there is no automatic mechanism by which workers in the mushroom growing industry in County Monaghan, for example, can be transferred painlessly and seamlessly to the IFSC in Dublin.  That would be generally recognised and, therefore, this represents a major challenge.<\/p> <p>  The third message is investment.  In so far as we will need to equip firms to divert trade to non-UK markets and to develop new product and service lines, there is a need for strategic investment in new and existing enterprises.  There ought to be an expanded role for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to interact directly with enterprises to equip them not only with finance, but with advice and strategic marketing support, where appropriate.  Clearly, the work of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are also crucial in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, the wider debate in the EU about fiscal rules needs to take into account the potential shock of Brexit for manufacturers and producers across the Union, especially the island of Ireland, which is most vulnerable.  There is a cogent argument here for adapting the fiscal rules to accord some flexibility in capital investment.<\/p> <p>  The final point relates to energy.  There is a role for the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government to ensure the single energy market for electricity is safeguarded and energy supplies in so far as is possible are secured into the future because we are very much dependent on fossil fuel imports, much of which come directly from the UK.<\/p> <p>  All this uncertainty and challenge throws up an opportunity to rethink our long-term enterprise strategy away gradually from one of over-dependence on foreign direct investment to a much stronger export-oriented indigenous economy.  This challenge has been posed for countries such as Finland, which went through an enormous economic shock in the 1990s, not least associated with the collapse of the USSR, to a relatively successful economic performance following many years of difficult transition.<\/p> <p>  The final shape of Brexit will determine outcomes for the Republic of Ireland.  By far the most preferable outcome would be some form of customs union for the UK and the EU.  If that were possible, then it is not impossible that Northern Ireland could remain within the EU whatever the precise constitutional arrangements in the long term there.  That would be hugely beneficial to people across the island of Ireland, in the absence of which the complications in respect of free movement of people and goods, services and rules of origin would be extremely challenging.  It would not be at all in our interest if such were the outcome of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1390,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Healy for his presentation, which is one in a series of presentations to the committee.  The trade union movement has a valuable role to play as a social partner in the Brexit discussion in terms of informing us and we welcome Dr. Healy in that context.  It is an obvious statement but it is a worrying time for workers but, equally, it is a worrying time for workers in the UK because over the past 40 years, the EU has set a high bar in respect of employment standards and how they should be applied.  There has been a significant contribution at that level.  With the advent of Brexit, have ICTU and NERI discussed with their colleagues in the UK the threat it may pose and the implications for Ireland?  Will it drive down costs in the UK?

We are, of course, in contact with our colleagues in the TUC, STUC and WTUC because there are circumstances for the TUC that it never expected to be engaged in.  The general secretary of the TUC had a meeting here with us and then the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade also met her.  One of the key issues is how hard-won rights and protections, mainly derived from EU legislation and directives, will be maintained.  There are worrying signs in this regard.  First, the British Prime Minister has indicated the big repeal Bill.  What happens when all the current legislation is repealed?   What will it be replaced with?  Clearly, there are issues and there is huge uncertainty but people are guessing.<\/p> <p>  Submissions are being made in Ireland, particularly related to the manufacturing industry, by IBEC.  In its view, an average manufacturing worker - and it links itself to the National Competitiveness Council for these figures - earns &pound;6 more than his or her counterpart in the UK.  It is arguing that labour cost is one of the key pieces for it in terms of competitiveness and if its members are to continue to trade with the UK, as they wish, this issue will have to be dealt with.<\/p><p>IBEC reference labour and capital costs as the two major issues, however, in any submissions it majors on labour costs.  IBEC relates it greatly to currency fluctuation.  During recent weeks, there has been much fluctuation.  While it may be settling a little during the past week, in the previous weeks it has been volatile.  IBEC judges that if the currency went to a value of 90 cent, we would be talking about an hourly rate difference of approximately &pound;7.50.  We know where this is going.  Workers will probably, in some cases, be involved in a race to the bottom.  The only way companies will be able to continue to trade and do business will be at the lowest possible price.  These arguments are being made.<\/p><p> Dr. Healy made a point about displacement.  However, while the financial services may produce jobs, they are no use to those who are losing manufacturing jobs in one part of the country.  All the statistics point to the fact that the jobs we are talking about, in many cases, are in indigenous industries and regionally based.  Particularly in manufacturing, we could face a very strong shock, depending on how it pans out.  It was very early in the day when we met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, with the TUC general secretary.  We made the point that we needed the Minister to say he would argue on behalf of Irish workers, that part of the deal is not to produce a race to the bottom, that EU directives will have to continue to apply here and that it will not be delivered on the backs of people who will either lose their jobs or have their incomes reduced as a result of it.  From our perspective, it is very worrying.<\/p><p> Deputy Niall Collins said he felt the trade union movement had much to say on this and indicated that it was proper that we be involved.  This is not necessarily the practice.  There is a consultative stakeholder consultation committee in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I have had to write to this committee.  Everybody is involved in the consultation committee, except anybody who represents a worker.  Thousands of unionised workers in the food and beverage industry, who are covered by collective agreements, are being talked about at the consultation committee.  They have farmers, producers and representatives of small firms, but not a sign of a worker.  We were not alerted that the consultation committee was being established.  We found out in the usual way one does.  I have contacted the Secretary General to ask the Department's intentions about inviting us.<\/p><p> As has often been the case in history, when companies get into severe difficulty, very often the trade union is the only group that goes in and tries to save the day.  I have been involved in a number of them over the years.  This is not an empty or vacuous claim.  Only for the collective agreement which the trade union movement hammered out, Bausch and Lomb would have been gone, which would have been a major loss to the country in terms of jobs.  I was involved in it and I know the details of it.  Given that the people most likely to lose are the workers, I do not understand why the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has taken this approach.  We hope we have something positive to offer.  Dr. Healy mentioned retraining.  Manufacturing is strongly unionised, we have very good insight into this, and why people would not want to tap into our insight is beyond me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1393,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King for her comments.  I am shocked to hear the trade unions were not invited to the committee.  It is a deep concern of mine, given that the jobs that have already been lost are in this sector.  Small farmers and food producers are the ones under major pressure.  IBEC's first statement after Brexit was that wages would have to be considered, which is a deep concern and I will appeal to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure all the unions are represented, not just in the consultation committee but in every group.  Workers are the ones who will be most affected by it.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Healy spoke about strategic investments in infrastructure as a result of Brexit.  I presume he referred to housing and schools, not just roads and buildings.  He also referred to the fiscal rules and how they limit our ability to respond to Brexit.  Could he elaborate on it?

We are vulnerable in renewable energy, given that EU climate change regulations will probably no longer apply in the UK in the long run, and this may affect our trade in renewables.  We need to invest more in renewables and this will require a State-led investment initiative.  The overall level of public capital investment probably needs to be doubled, as a percentage of GDP.  We need to invest more than 4% of GDP instead of just under 2%.  The EU fiscal rules in this regard are not helpful, given that they treat investment in exactly the same way as Government consumption.  The inflexibility of the rules on the composition of investment needs to shift.  For example, much construction activity in the health and education sectors must take account of new EU regulations on energy consumption.  For example, the regulations on school construction are much more rigorous, and this is probably adding up to 20% on costs in addition to recent estimates.  This is an example of where fiscal rules need to allow member states to operate on a much longer timeframe and take a view that this upfront expenditure will have an economic return in the long run.<\/p> <p>  Although my comments are very much focused on the economic and employment implications of our response to Brexit, I underline the importance of the challenge for all of Irish society and the need for a whole of Government approach.  It crosses all Ministries and requires careful consideration from an economic, social, legal and constitutional point of view.  It is probably the most significant challenge we have faced in many decades and, I am afraid, it will be with us for many more years.  The upside is that we have an opportunity to question the existing economic and social model we have and this may be a very good opportunity - the best of times and the worst of times - to make a new departure and a real difference in the way we do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016102500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1477411200,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>Dr. Healy mentioned an early warning system, establishing a retraining fund and investment in education and training.

Local employers and trade unions representatives often have excellent insight into and knowledge of the way companies operate at local level.  The reason this is urgent and requires that scale of co-operation and input is that when redundancies are threatened, it is almost too late and we are then dealing with a liquidation situation.  There is a role here for State agencies, perhaps not unlike the role of the Industrial Credit Corporation when it existed to anticipate trouble and to get out early and identify problems.  It may not be possible to avoid closure in some cases but we can then prepare and make the necessary adaptations and training efforts.  It might also be possible in some cases to keep companies open for a while with the agreement of all concerned.  That approach was used in Germany successfully during the intiial period of the recession in 2009.  It involved co-operation in terms of shorter hours but also government subsidies, in effect, to keep the firm open.

The trade unions have much to offer under that heading for the simple reason, as Dr. Healy said, that we would be very engaged at a local level with the employer.  The current scenario is very imbalanced.  We have consultations, discussions and considerations of these matters but we do not want them to be devoid of positivity.  People want to keep their jobs.  They want to know what type of restructuring and retaining needs to happen.  People who find themselves in that situation are very intelligent about those matters.  They want to make the moves that will ensure they will retain their careers, continue in their jobs, have their incomes and that their company stays in business.  It is not only about tapping into a fund of &euro;25 million or &euro;50 million; this is much more holistic and, therefore, it requires a holistic approach.

Northern Ireland has suffered over a very long period from a run down of manufacturing industries.  That is a long-term trend.  They have been major cyclical shocks, some of it related to energy prices and to jobs losses in companies like Caterpillar and others.  There is a concerted campaign now in Northern Ireland involving Manufacturing Northern Ireland which represents manufacturing enterprises and a number of unions, in particular, the Unite trade union.  Underpinning that is an indepth analysis of the role and potential of manufacturing.  I emphasise manufacturing, which while it accounts for only 10% of the workforce in Northern Ireland, is a crucial part of economic recovery there in whatever will be precise outcome of Brexit.  Manufacturers and exporters in the food sector are very vulnerable.  They are exporting to the Republic.  It may be that currency volatility is working to their advantage at present but there are long-term downsides and risks.<\/p> <p>  An enterprise strategy for Northern Ireland needs a number of elements.  It needs a strong emphasis on infrastructural development and investment.  Northern Ireland is very behind in terms of key infrastructural investment.  This is evident with respect to roads and public transport and also in other areas.  A second aspect is energy costs which are quite high on both parts of the island, especially in Northern Ireland.  They need to be tackled.  A third aspect is workforce skills and training, and equipping companies and the workforce to perform at a much higher level.  There is evidence that productivity shortfalls especially impact on more traditional manufacturing companies outside the food sector within Northern Ireland.  All of that calls for a strategic input and co-operation, including from the Northern Ireland Executive, notwithstanding the limitation of powers, but there is a continuing role for an all-island perspective and co-operation.

A striking feature of what it found was that once people pass the age of 45, progression into employment dramatically drops.  The feedback we have received is that this very much depends on the sector.  Some people feel that once they go past their mid-40s, depending on the sector, securing employment is difficult and, for others, they find that to be the case when they are older than that.  When we have discussed this issue with employers and employer representatives many of them acknowledge this to be case.  There are a range of factors at play.

We are likely to be in a 27 member European Union without the United Kingdom and in which severe pressure will be applied in areas across the spectrum of social and fiscal policy, not only on corporation tax.  We will have to make a decision on which broad model we will pursue.  If we try to proceed at two levels by approximating the sterling cost base - the Deputy referred to this crucial point - I am not convinced we will be able to do this in conjunction with moving towards a more European norm of taxation and enterprise policy and the way this will play out in the labour market.  Our costs are below the average for the EU-15 countries, that is, the developed, traditional EU economies in the eurozone.  In some cases, our costs are higher than in the UK.  When I refer to labour costs I also mean employer social contributions, which are a big element in other European countries.<\/p> <p>  We have a very painful choice to make.  In some cases, it may mean moving away from dependence on UK markets and moving towards higher scale and higher costs, albeit equilibrated by higher productivity, and, in the long run, taking a different strategic position in the market.  This will require very careful planning.  It is understandable that significant pressure will be applied by some sectors and producers to follow the UK downwards in terms of costs and taxation rates and the recent budget illustrated responses to that.

Since then, I believe we have taken part in one meeting in the Department of the Taoiseach and we have not been engaged in any more in-depth discussions elsewhere, nor have we been invited to any such discussions.  If I was asked whether such discussions are taking place, we suspect they are taking place and we probably even hope they are taking place.  We do not know where or with whom, however.

I note that all other members rearranged their schedules to make sure that they were here.  It is not just a run-of-the-mill meeting.  The issues that were raised before the committee previously by the West Cork Development Partnership and Comhar na nOile&aacute;n are very prevalent.  There is a timescale factor involved.  They are under severe pressure.  The board of Comhar na nOile&aacute;n has put two employees on protective notice because of the uncertainty over Leader funding.  Those two people are to be let go at the end of the month.  That is why we needed an urgent hearing.  The Minister is not taking it seriously and if she was otherwise engaged, the Minister of State and the officials should have been made available to come in and explain what is happening on the ground.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the budgetary process, we know that there is a lot of horse-trading going on post budget over the allocations that are going to be made.<\/p><p>We in the Irish language community are very unhappy that there has been such a severe cut to Irish language funding.  There has been a &euro;6 million cut in capital funding.  We wanted to make that case to the Minister today.  It is totally unacceptable that she is not here.  She should make herself available.  She has been dodging media interviews on the Irish language issue as well stating that she has devolved those responsibilities to the Minister of State.  If that is the case, the Minister should have known that when she got the invite and the Minister of State should have been made available to appear before the committee.  It is totally unacceptable and shows a bit of drochmheas on the committee that she is not here.

It leads to transparency into the administration of that Minister if the Minister is open with the committee.  That is good governance and, as such, it is a central element to the committee that we would have the right to discuss what has happened to the Irish language over the past number of years.  This also concerns the partnership issues.  This does not apply to west Cork alone.  West Cork has had a particularly unusual experience recently and there are many questions to be answered.  I know there are many questions to be answered with regard to the contracts that have been won by a partnership in Meath in recent times also.  We just want to get to the heart of how money is spent by the Government on behalf of citizens.  We need to be able to ask the questions on behalf of the citizens that elect us.
