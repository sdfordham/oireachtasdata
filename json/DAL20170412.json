Their work is truly heroic; it is the personification of true Christian values.  Their simple objective is to relieve the hardship endured by homeless people.  However, their work gives crucial insights into the failure of the various housing strategies and interventions to date to resolve the crisis.  They are at the coalface and they see the daily realities of this failure in the context of the number of people turning up for breakfast, lunch and food parcels and, in particular, the extraordinary number of children in emergency accommodation who also attend the centre.<\/p><p>Their story at the coalface is one of a scandal that is becoming worse, especially for the children.<\/p> <p> Some years back the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People was told that the emergency accommodation crisis for children would be solved.  I will give the Taoiseach an insight.  In 2013, there were 2,747 children attending for lunch.  In 2016, there were 8,353 children.  This is a 76% increase and a shocking indictment.  They are extremely worried about the overall well-being of these children who are forced to attend the centre and the debilitating and damaging impact that emergency accommodation environment has on the children's development.  It is heart-rending and the State is failing these children right now.  Total presentations at the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People are close to 400,000 a year to avail of the various services.  The costs are about &euro;3.5 million.  The State's contribution is &euro;450,000, which is embarrassing relative to the scale of the crisis and the response of this centre to it.  Ministers have visited the centre and the Taoiseach has visited the centre, and yet there was a social worker who retired in 2012 and that person has never been replaced.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has acknowledged the urgent need for a child welfare officer, particularly for child protection issues, but nothing has happened in this regard, and there have been a number of other demands and requests made.<\/p> <p> The key point is that there is an enormous disconnect between the reality at the coalface, as evidenced by the daily work at the centre, and the official rhetoric about strategies and interventions.  Housing policies are not impacting on this daily reality, which is getting worse.  It is a fact that we are not building enough council houses.  There is some ideological opposition across the system to that.  It is appalling.  Houses are not being built quickly enough and the emergency accommodation crisis is getting worse for children.  This should be our overall priority.<\/p> <p> I want the Taoiseach to recognise and acknowledge this reality and to work with the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People to attend to its immediate needs in recognising the reality of the emergency crisis for children and work to provide the officers the centre requires and the assistance the children require.  This reality is not going anywhere soon.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the interventions to date have not made any dent on this appalling indictment of State policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491995100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>This is part of the challenge we face as a society and as a Government in delivering and providing services for people in a various categories who have real problems in this regard.  I have been down to visit Brother Kevin at the centre on a number of occasions.  He is an extraordinary man and he has been doing this work for years.  Obviously, the numbers who turn up at his centre speak for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  It is not all without inactivity.  The Government has allocated serious resources for tackling homelessness in the budget for this year, with &euro;100 million being spent on homeless services.  This is not an insignificant figure.  In addition, the overall housing budget for this year is &euro;1.3 billion.  Deputy Martin and I have discussed this before and the issue is how quickly the necessary houses can be built.  The Minister has set out targets for not having people in emergency accommodation and targets for providing accommodation for people who are homeless and sleeping rough or who are in hostels at various locations in Dublin.  Some of the projects have been extraordinarily successful.  In 2016, there were 3,052 households that exited homelessness, which is the highest level ever.  The ambition is very high this year.  Deputy Martin spoke of building houses, and work is under way on advancing 650 rapid-build homes in 2017.  There will be another 500 units in 2018.  O'Devaney Gardens is up the road from Brother Kevin's centre.  That site has lain there for years but work is now under way.<\/p><p>There are places like George's Place in D&uacute;n Laoghaire with 12 homes, St. Aidan's off Brookfield Road with 71 homes, Poppintree in Ballymun with 22, Cherry Orchard in Ballyfermot with 24, and so on.  Construction is under way in quite a lot of places.  I agree it is by no means perfect and there are always gaps in the level of services that are provided.  These issues are being addressed constantly, as Deputy Martin is well aware.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has a special unit which meets regularly.  It has provided incentives, opportunities and shortcuts for private enterprise to be able to build houses on public property and for local authorities to provide houses.  The development of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme has made an important contribution, as has the provision of homes and services for those who have particular difficulties.<\/p> <p> The Dublin Region Homeless Executive confirmed a minimum of 142 people on its last count at the end of the year.  Developments have taken place to provide beds in what are very good hostels.  I have looked at a number of those.  Brother Kevin does an extraordinary job.  This is part of the enormous range of challenges the Government is trying to meet.  We must have the engine that can drive our economy to provide these services, be it chiropody or dental or whatever, down in those centres.  Deputy Martin may shake his head.  It is not as perfect as one would wish but these matters are receiving real priority, not just from the HSE but from the different agencies to try to provide in the best and most effective way possible for many of these people.  Part of that is putting &euro;100 million on the table for services and &euro;1.3 billion this year for housing for the homeless, social housing and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200004#B00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491995400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I ask all speakers to try to adhere to the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200005#C00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491995400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>That response - &euro;100 million - is meaningless.  The hotel money is an appalling waste.  The Capuchin centre gets &euro;450,000 and the Taoiseach is talking about &euro;100 million for children in emergency accommodation.  I will give the Taoiseach the figures again.  In 2013, 4,747 children attended for meals at that centre.  At the end of last year, 8,353 had attended.  That says it all.  There is a terrible disconnect between the official rhetoric and the reality.<\/p>  <p>  The census figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, give the truth as well.  A total of 2% of all houses and apartments occupied nationwide at the moment are new, built between 2011 and last year.  Some 11,572 new houses were built in Dublin during that time.  The Taoiseach knows the big difference between the CSO figures and those of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in terms of actual new builds.  In no way is the response commensurate with the scale of the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  One lesson that I took away from the Capuchin centre, which they wanted me to bring back to Leinster House, was the enormous psychological impact on the children in terms of the stigma of homelessness and the lack of any stable, permanent anchor in their lives.  No officers have been appointed.  The very least the Taoiseach should do is recognise the reality for those children and give additional supports and officers to the centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200005#C00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1491995400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>There are children who have challenges and particular difficulties from different parts of the country.  Every local authority has at its disposal finance and services to provide in the best way possible for those children, and there are some with very particular difficulties, as the Deputy is well aware.  The Government has made the decision to provide &euro;5.3 billion to deliver social housing between now and 2021.  The Deputy says there is a disconnect between that figure and the reality of what is happening on the ground.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing have told every single local authority: \"There is your money.  Show me your sites.  Build your houses.  Here are the incentives.\"  Years ago, local authorities were very active in building houses.  They range now between approved housing bodies and local authorities.  The money is on the table.  The housing assistance payment this year will accommodate 15,000 households and will help to keep people in their homes.<\/p><p>Last year, nearly 18,500 housing supports were provided from a housing budget provision of &euro;935 million.

The Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services was on the verge of agreeing a report that would have comprehensively addressed the demands for which so many people have protested and marched in recent years.  However, the Taoiseach was not having that.  The Taoiseach could not listen and accept the will of the people.  The Taoiseach still clings to the hope that he will finally have his way.<\/p>  <p>  The antics of the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to save the Government's rejected water policy have been truly a sight to behold.  The political choreography was set.  Senior counsel came to the committee and delivered legal advice that completely contradicted the legal advice offered only one week before.  Conveniently, the legal advice delivered yesterday was in line with the Government's needs.  It tore through the agreed position of the committee and gave the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il a way out.

I came into the D&aacute;il in 2011 and brought in with me, probably for the first time, dozens of families and individuals, including children, who were facing housing emergencies at that time.  I warned the Taoiseach that his policy of moving away from direct council housing construction towards reliance on the private sector would generate a crisis.  Today, again, there are approximately 25 households, individuals, families and children in the Visitors Gallery.  They are just the tip of a very dire and desperate iceberg of misery, anxiety, insecurity and suffering because of the abject and total failure of the Government's policies on housing and homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  I want the Taoiseach to look those people in the eye and tell them that his housing policies are working.  Tell Sinead and her three year old daughter, who was told a few weeks ago to go 12 km into town with her children to a hostel where there are active drug users.  She then had to fight to get into a hotel and last week was taken into hospital with stress because she is still homeless.  Tell James and his family - a mother and their five children - who have been homeless for the past six months, whose daughter has special needs and who are being pushed from one hotel or emergency accommodation to another.  Tell Richard, who is recovering from addiction and who is only offered hostels where drug use is rampant despite letters from his doctors about his mental health issues.

Tell Carrie, who has been homeless for a year and is forced to share a room with three people who are smoking heroin.  Tell Tom, who has been homeless for five years and who had to lodge court papers against South Dublin County Council because it took him off the housing list and took away his time.  Tell Amanda and her two children, Sarah and Eamon and their four children, Samantha and her three children, all of whom had HAP tenancies - the Government's great solution and the centrepiece of its housing policy - and who are all now being evicted by landlords who want to pull out of the HAP arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200008#F01100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1491996900,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200008#F01200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491996900,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Tell Antonia, whose father has motor neurone disease and who - along with her father - is about to be evicted at the end of this month and has nowhere to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200008#F01300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1491996900,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I call the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200008#F01400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491996900,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Tell Anna, who is living in a boxroom at her parents' house, sharing with her 14 year old niece, her two year old daughter and a three year old son.

He mentioned that particular case before.<\/p> <p> There are lists of houses that are currently under construction and for which taxpayers' money has been put up.  Money has been given to local authorities to get on with building.  Quite recently, &euro;200 million was allocated by this House in order to obtain access to sites so houses could be built for people such as those the Deputy describes.  Nobody wants to see the situation continue.  This Government is working very actively on this.  That is why there is a senior Ministry for housing and a special unit in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  That is why an unprecedented amount of money has been provided to all local authorities to buy, renovate or build houses.

Two of those branches are located in Ardara and Raphoe in my constituency of Donegal.  Once they are closed, it will leave these rural towns without any form of banking facility at all.<\/p>  <p>  Ulster Bank claims the restructuring of its services is required to meet the ongoing cost challenges of RBS, yet this is a flawed rationale.  Ulster Bank had a recorded profit of &euro;280 million in 2016 and paid a dividend of &euro;1.5 billion to RBS.<\/p>  <p>  The truth of the matter is that the banks are not interested in addressing the needs of communities.  They will always be driven by profit margins, but while private sector banks restructure their businesses and move online, communities still need banking services to survive.  How does the Taoiseach expect rural communities to restructure with them?  They cannot, and rural communities will suffer as a result.<\/p>  <p>  Banking services are vital to the survival of towns.  Reports and studies have shown the consequences of banks retreating from rural communities, not only for customers but also for small business, which Fine Gael loves so much.  In the UK, lending to SMEs has reduced by 64%, and the reduction is as much as 104% where the town has no bank left.  A town received on average &pound;1.6 million less in lending the year after a closure.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will reply to me that Ulster Bank is not an Irish institution and the Government cannot intervene.  I have already got that from the Minister for Finance.  Let me remind the Taoiseach of the consequences facing rural Ireland because the Government refuses to intervene: an ongoing transport crisis, including the latest Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute, Garda station closures, post office closures, delays in rolling out broadband, continued emigration, and banking closures.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government may not be able to intervene in the latest bank closures, there are issues it can influence.  In rural Ireland, we have a network of community banks called credit unions.  The Government continues to hide behind the regulator who is doing nothing to facilitate them to develop in a way that can assist their communities and meet the needs of rural towns, for example, funding social housing projects or providing a range of banking services.  It is as if, like Ulster Bank, the Government does not care about the needs of rural communities and the Government's policies reflect that in prioritising private sector banks over credit unions.<\/p>  <p>  As well as Ulster Bank's announcement last week, we heard from An Post, in last night's \"Prime Time\", that it has identified 265 post offices as non-viable.  No doubt we will see plans crystalising over the coming months seeking to close these too.  Interestingly, McKinsey was consultants to both Ulster Bank and An Post and was the author of their strategies for nationwide closures.  No wonder these strategies look so alike.<\/p>  <p>  It is over two years since the Kerr report on the future of the post office network was published.  What implementation have we seen by the Government?  None.  The Government has merely allowed the crisis to deepen.  The Taoiseach can avoid taking any responsibility for Ulster Bank and the communities that are being devastated by the bank, but he cannot wring his hands and claim no responsibility for the destruction of the post office network and the continued stifling of credit unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200010#H00500","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1491998100,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

Two reports on credit unions were produced.  The Government has implemented them and is fully supportive of the credit unions all over the country.  It is not true for the Deputy to say that the Government has no interest in rural Ireland - far from it.  In fact, many of the major policies of this Government are focused directly on giving opportunity and incentive to rural Ireland, not least the recent announcement by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment regarding the roll-out of national broadband.  The review of the capital programme for the next number of years, which will provide opportunities for infrastructure throughout all parts of the country, including the Deputy's area, is under way.  As a result, I do not accept at all his suggestion that the Government has reneged or is reneging on its commitment to rural Ireland.  Every single regional sector has shown a growth in employment.<\/p> <p> In respect of the Deputy's opening remarks about the way people do their business now, he should appreciate - as I am sure he does - that &euro;14,000, I think, is now spent online every minute by people doing their business.  The way people do their business has changed and it will not go back to the way it was.  I cannot speak for Ulster Bank, but we do support the credit unions and the opportunity to provide basic banking facilities in post offices and to give them whatever services can be given.  Post offices will not survive unless they are used by people.  They cannot be locked away if everything is dealt with online.  If they are social centres, which they are, and very important for communication, they must have a range of services that people will use and want to use because that is the lifeblood of business as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200010#H01500","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491998700,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Regarding the rural action plan, there is much plan and no action.

How does this reflect on the Government's action plan?  It shows that no action is taking place.  People cannot use post offices if the latter cannot provide services.  That is the bottom line.  Two years on from publication, the Kerr report has not been implemented.  All the Government does is open up more consultations.  Nothing actually happens, and that is the problem.  The Government needs to take action.  I have met the Registrar of Credit Unions.  The Registry of Credit Unions gives the perception of being helpful but it does nothing except place obstacles in the paths of the credit unions.  The Taoiseach's Government can change that policy and engage with and direct the registrar to be a facilitator of the credit unions providing services, not a blockage in their path.  The Government can take action but, unfortunately, is not doing so.  It can take action to strengthen the post office network and the credit unions and allow them to facilitate and help people and business in rural areas but it is too slow in dragging out the roll-out of these plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200011#J00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1491998700,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thought the Deputy might take the opportunity to say that people with the challenge of cystic fibrosis in rural Ireland are very encouraged today by the decision made by the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE in respect of Orkambi and Kalydeco.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200011#J00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491998700,"counter":143,"content":"<p>That is for another day-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200011#J00400","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1491998700,"counter":144,"content":"<p>They live in rural Ireland as well.<\/p><p>The Deputy mentioned Cockhill Bridge in Inishowen, which is now in receipt of several million euro as a consequence of interest in rural Ireland.

That is just a little observation when all the outrage and rhetoric is made.  There was a reason for that.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government said funding would be increased for home care packages and home help every year.  A research project was carried out, I think by the Health Research Board, HRB, on the overall situation pertaining to resources for home care packages, home help and nursing homes.  There was some suggestion that a means test would be introduced for home care.  Will the Government fulfil the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a uniform home care service in order that all recipients can receive quality support seven days a week, where possible?  That is in the programme for Government.  Is that a real commitment?  Could the Minister indicate the follow-up in terms of the HRB report?  One of the biggest challenges facing us, thankfully, is that people are living longer in Ireland than did any previous generation but that will require far greater end-stage-of-life interventions, in particular in the form of home care packages, home help and nursing homes.  The fiscal side of the House has never quite come to terms with that demographic reality and there is a need for some intervention in that regard to try to marry the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200012#K01300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1491999300,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister for Health to respond to Deputy Martin's question on home care packages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200012#K01400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1491999300,"counter":166,"content":"<p>He should confine his response to a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200012#K01500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491999300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin made a fair point.

Despite that, these clinics remain unregulated, whereas those clinics which give factual, proper health information are regulated under the 1995 Act.  Some of these clinics were inadvertently funded by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  We recently saw the exposure of yet another clinic giving bogus information to women in crisis and stressful situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200014#M01900","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000500,"counter":208,"content":"<p>We are on promised legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200014#M02000","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1492000500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>That has to be dealt with urgently.

The Government is conscious that the commission has made no findings to date regarding abuse or neglect and believes it would not be appropriate to deal with the questions of redress in advance of any conclusions that will be reached by the commission.  In addition, the redress scheme that was there was complex to administer and often difficult for applicants.  The Comptroller and Auditor reported recently on the 2002 residential institutions redress scheme and highlighted the cost to the State, the diminution in the value of the offers made by the congregations, the need for evaluations and lessons learned.  The focus will now be on assisting those who were unaccompanied as children in the mother and baby homes with a view to offering very meaningful supports that will be of genuine and practical value to them.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will consult with representatives further about this.  We want to do this in a way whereby the State will help and support these people - through the provision of appropriate services - in respect of this aspect of their lives.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is working with Tusla to support the provision of information to assist former residents who may wish to establish when they resided in a mother and baby home.  This might involve very painstaking work on a matter that is obviously very personal for some people who want to find out where their mother was or who she was.  Dr. James Gallen from Dublin City University has been asked to assist in the design of a model of transitional justice as a means of giving voice to former residents of mother and baby homes and county homes.

The reason I believe this is urgent is because the Taoiseach has said that he does not interfere in industrial relations but we have an ongoing dispute, which is a national crisis, in our public transport.  It is now in its 20th day and as we speak, the parties are in the Workplace Relations Commission meeting.  I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact, as already outlined by Deputy Boyd Barrett in the D&aacute;il last week, that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, now has &euro;100 million extra from VAT that it had not calculated for and was not expecting.  A figure in the region of &euro;18 million or &euro;19 million could sort out the deficit in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that this money is lying there and if it could possibly be used to save the company?  When the issue was raised of the &euro;17 million that could be saved by paying Bus &Eacute;ireann the equal amount of social welfare subsidy for free travel as is paid to the private operator, I noted that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, responded by stating this was like comparing the price of free travel with the price of subsidising Coca-Cola.  This indicates to me the utter class snobbery driving this Government.  The Government - and especially Ministers such as Deputy Varadkar who were born and bred with a silver spoon in their mouths - does not understand ordinary working-class people and the needs of the poorer and more vulnerable people in the State for free public transport and for public transport that works and delivers for the most marginalised.

It would seem that this would also seriously undermine Bus &Eacute;ireann's ability to provide an essential public transport service to communities and towns right across the State.  The Government's refusal to engage constructively in the dispute has contributed significantly to the duration and impact on the travelling public.

While the transport portfolio has been held by various high-profile Ministers over the last six years, the Government's only strategy is to try to get through the latest crisis.  There is no sense that there is a policy on what level or quality of public transport services should be available or what the State subvention levels should be.  Each of the public transport companies is being defined by what it can do without going bankrupt, rather than working to implement an overall vision for access and quality.  If we had that policy framework in place, we may have never seen this Bus &Eacute;ireann strike.  The workers have gone through an awful lot of sacrifices and have lost a lot over the last four weeks.  Belatedly, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has said he will convene a forum and that the free travel scheme and the public service obligation will be applied differently.  It is past time for the Government and the Minister to produce a formal statement of Government objectives and resources with regard to public transport provision in Ireland.  The overriding feeling of people on the ground is that had this dispute been in Dublin, it would have been resolved a long time ago.

It is not for me to comment on the court's independent way of, we hope, bringing about a resolution.  Things are not at a standstill in rural Ireland.  I pass through large swathes of it every week.  The Government is expanding the public bus service in rural Ireland by increasing the amount of public service obligation money pumped in there and increasing funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann and to the rural transport programme as well.  Bus &Eacute;ireann got a 21% increase in its PSO funding in 2016.  Total funding for both PSO and rural transport will amount to approximately &euro;277 million this year, which is a substantial amount and a &euro;28 million increase on last year.  Will the Government subsidise the Expressway routes?  No.  They are commercial services operating in competition with other commercial services.  As with any other commercial operator, Bus &Eacute;ireann cannot receive taxpayer funding for those services.  Taxpayer support is available for public service obligation services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann receives taxpayer funding for those socially necessary but financially unviable services that form part of its legally contracted PSO network with the National Transport Authority.  I am sure Deputy Brady understands that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Social Protection have instructed officials in respect of the free travel arrangements to which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin referred.  I hope that will take effect immediately.  There was mention of transport policy.  Obviously, there are competitive forces at work in the private sector providing transport to many locations throughout the country.  The National Transport Authority has a very robust, expanding rural transport scheme.  In respect of this particular problem which caused the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute, namely, the Expressway service, where Bus &Eacute;ireann is in competition with private enterprise on motorway routes, if its buses have to come off the motorway and go through towns and villages, it causes a delay for passengers who want to get from point A to point B.  The National Transport Authority has said that any changes brought about as a result of a settlement of this dispute can be taken up by the National Transport Authority in servicing areas that might not be serviced in future and by Bus &Eacute;ireann but that is a matter-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200019#R00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1492003500,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach answer the question about the &euro;100 million that Transport Infrastructure Ireland has-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200019#R00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1492003500,"counter":296,"content":"<p>This matter is before the Labour Court, as Deputy Smith is aware.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200019#R00400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1492003500,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I am asking for the Taoiseach's comment on what will be done with that &euro;100 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200019#R00500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1492003500,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Please, Deputy Smith.

I commend Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, all the families and their supporters for their persistence in campaigning for this issue over a considerable period.  However, the crisis around CF therapies is also evidence of the wider crisis in our health service.  Two weeks ago, Dr. Tom Keane, former director of the State's cancer control programme, said that if any other country had the kind of problems found in the Irish health service, the Government would not survive.  He described the health service as being close to total systems failure and called for the delivery of health care to change before there is what he described as a profoundly negative impact on people dependent on the public system.<\/p>  <p>  The Towards 2026 report argues for greater accountability, clarity on funding, better leadership and stronger political support.  The Government has failed dismally on all of these fronts.  This week, we learned that there are 82 unfilled posts across community mental health services that cater for children and adolescents with severe mental health disorders, including suicidal youngsters.

In respect of conditions and diseases that are particular to the Irish DNA and are more prevalent here than in other areas, there is a need for a more effective approach from the Government to the approval of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  In the earlier phase of this campaign, there was no engagement going on if the truth be told.  That is what worried me more than anything.  There was then an attempt to undermine the quality of Orkambi as a drug.<\/p><p>I raised the matter with the Taoiseach several times on Leaders' Questions.  Despite all the leaks to the various newspapers, it took six weeks to two months to get acknowledgement that Orkambi is a valid game-changer in terms of its impact on people with cystic fibrosis of a particular mutation.  That has concerned me somewhat and it speaks to a lack of an overall policy.<\/p> <p> I am unsure whether Fine Gael has a policy on health anymore.  Compulsory health insurance was dropped.  The damage of the Reilly and Varadkar years has been left in place.  One of the core issues that emerged from that period was the degree to which there was direct interference with transparent and honest service planning within the HSE.  Repeatedly, Ministers have required the HSE to promise a level of service for which the required funding has not been provided.  Will the Taoiseach provide an assurance that no member of Government has interfered with the wording of this year's service plan to cover up a mismatch between promises and funding?  Can the Taoiseach explain why we have had repeated failure to implement funding for mental health services?  The Government's existence rests on having promised this funding.

He reassured me that, at the outside, by now the child would have received the urgently-needed operation.  As the Taoiseach can imagine, the child's mother is in touch with the hospital all the time but she and her daughter have simply been told to wait and wait.  The operation now seems to have been put back well back into the next couple of months.  We were sure it would have been performed by now.  I have not raised the matter with the Taoiseach again since then.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot understand a system that keeps a child of nine years with a well-diagnosed condition and exceptional other difficulties and issues waiting.

I will come back to Deputy Burton on that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin raised the question of health policy.  It has always been accepted that Orkambi is a game-changer in the sense of improving the quality of life of patients with cystic fibrosis.  The problem lay with the price being demanded by the company involved.  This is one of the most expensive drugs ever in the history of the State.  The pharmacoeconomics group met the company.  As Deputies are aware, a change has taken place whereby the group makes a recommendation on whether a given cost is valid.  The Minister proceeded to make contact with other Ministers in other countries where similar problems have arisen.  In any event, I am pleased the matter has been resolved.  It was never a case of not recognising that Orkambi is a valid drug for improving the quality of life for patients.  Cost was the issue.  The earlier exchange was on looking at the process.  This is not confined to Ireland.  If this is the first case in Europe of having a portfolio of drugs that provide certainty and stability for patients, then that is probably the way to go.  It may well reduce the cost over a five or ten-year period.  While Orkambi and Kalydeco will cost a substantial amount of money over ten years, they give that certainty and emotional support for patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the various speakers that cystic fibrosis patients have an exceptional commitment to dealing with their particular challenges.  I am pleased that in recent years we have had public expenditure in cystic fibrosis units at various locations throughout the country.  The improvement in the air quality in these centres - the air is changed so many times every hour - adds greatly to their comfort and ability to go to the next day and so on.  In that sense I am pleased this matter has been resolved.  I hope the Minister for Health will now be able to move on to other drugs companies and discuss portfolios of drugs for particular categories of patients who need them.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin spoke to me before about the mental health situation.  I know he is concerned about it.  I will give the Deputy an update from the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on where we stand, what money is being spent and on what it is being spent in order that we can see whether we can progress that matter.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brady referred to Professor Keane.  Obviously, he did his job with the cancer centres of excellence.  That was a difficult issue for many hospitals.  I disagree with Deputy Brady's suggestion that there is anything like a total systems failure.  The vast majority of people who have gone through the public health system have nothing but credit and praise to offer in respect of those who work in the system.  In many cases, staff are working under pressure.  A total of &euro;14.6 billion has been allocated for 2017 - up &euro;1 billion on last year.  We can see how issues can intervene in that in the light of the Orkambi and Kalydeco question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200020#S00500","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1492004100,"counter":323,"content":"<p>A total of 60 more people are lying on trollies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200020#S00600","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1492004100,"counter":324,"content":"<p>The problem is to get inside the system in a way that is efficient and realistic for people.

That is what we need at many other locations as well and that is part of the plan for the capital expenditure programme.  The Minister has visited various hospitals throughout the country.

With regard to preparing for eventualities now in a completely changed environment in which even a football team on the way to a football match is not immune to attack, does the Taoiseach think we need to up our own game?  I ask for his own thoughts on the need now perhaps to have a bespoke security agency separate from normal policing, which would in a way free An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be the community police force it was initially envisaged to be, and on the need to up our game to prepare ourselves for the real challenges that exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200021#T00700","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1492004700,"counter":336,"content":"<p>It is a very valid question that Deputy Howlin raises.

Bluntly, it is not my experience that one would go through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  There are experts in every Department, right down to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, although I do not know what issue would affect it - maybe the collapse of a national monument.  We certainly do not have that skill set available in every single Department and it seems unnecessary to have it available.

In particular, as Deputy Howlin said, we remember the crew of Rescue 116, Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciaran Smith and their heroic contribution to life saving in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that our current national arrangements for emergency management have effectively been left unchanged since they were first introduced by Deputy O'Dea a decade ago.  Even though the scale and nature of potential emergencies has evolved dramatically since then, all structures are the same and there is no legislation concerning co-ordination of a State response to a major emergency.  Ireland is one of the only countries in the world without any form of statute legislation concerning the structure for responding to national emergencies, such as widespread flooding or a public health disaster.  It is the consistent model internationally that the prime minister's office takes the lead responsibility.  I believe it is time for us to review our structures and implement appropriate legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I met recently with the professional representatives of our Defence Forces, the Army in particular.  It was shocking to listen to some of the revelations.  For example, in Kilworth Camp, so low is the strength, the requisite number of corporals are not available to facilitate live fire tactical training, so they cannot do the training.  The Air Corps is essentially a nine-to-five operation and is not in a position to do 24-7 operations.  I understand there were fundamental changes in the bomb disposal unit and the exit of very experienced bomb disposal personnel.  I agree with Deputy Howlin in regard to our state of readiness in the context of a terrorist attack.  We are far too complacent, as a country, in regard to that threat and we should do far more to prepare our responses.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have been in decline and numbers are below strength.

The Office of Emergency Planning, which is in the Department of Defence, co-ordinates the response to an emergency and it promotes best practice in emergency planning.  The Government task force on emergency planning is comprised of representatives of all Departments and relevant agencies and it meets regularly to discuss emergency planning and management.  The framework for major emergency management lists various types of emergencies, some of which I read out to Deputy Howlin.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Emergency Planning has prepared a draft document entitled, Strategic Emergency Management - National Structures and Framework.  That is due to come to Government very shortly and we will publish it before the summer so people can reflect on the very issue that Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Howlin rightly raise.  When an emergency occurs that requires a national level response, the current guidelines for co-ordinating a national level emergency crisis response, which are publicly available on the Office of Emergency Planning website, set out the steps that are taken to manage it.  In a national emergency, the lead Department convenes the national emergency co-ordination committee.  The paper that is to be presented will provide a forum to discuss these central questions.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware of the vigilance of the Garda and the intelligence units in monitoring a small number of individuals who do not have this country's interests at heart.  That is a very precise and confidential matter.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin raised the question of the Air Corps.  There are cadets in training and a cadet recruitment campaign is underway.  Four personnel will complete air traffic control training between May and September this year and the Air Corps is currently inducting a further air traffic control course.  NCO vacancies in the Air Corps will be filled from the recently-launched NCO promotion competition.  Deputy Martin is aware that when somebody qualifies through the Air Corps, they are on contract for 12 years before they have the opportunity to leave, so it is not a question of training people and they then leave for private enterprise as soon as they are trained.  There is a period of contract which they give back to the State in respect of the training they receive.<\/p>  <p>  I would be happy to associate with the party leaders in regard to the central question raised by Deputy Howlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200022#U00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1492005300,"counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200022#U00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1492005300,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Pat Casey - the report into Sunbeam House services in Wicklow and south Dublin; (2) Deputy Thomas Byrne - the recent cut in occupational therapy services in County Meath; (3) Deputy Niamh Smyth - the impact of the closure of Ulster Bank branches; (4) Deputy John Brassil - activity-based budget allocations in University Hospital Kerry for 2017; (5) Deputies Pat Buckley and Billy Kelleher - CAMHS services in Cork; (6) Deputy Carol Nolan - terms and conditions of non-academic third level staff; (7) Deputies Joan Burton, Clare Daly and Catherine Connolly - the second interim report into mother and baby homes; (8) Deputy Eamon Scanlon - the retirement age of retained firefighters; (9) Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony - the cessation of the river Bandon flood relief scheme; (10) Deputy Mary Butler - the Health Research Board report on statutory home care; (11) Deputy Mick Wallace - the ongoing conflict in Syria; (12) Deputy Aindrias Moynihan - the removal of 2,258 nurses from the active register by the board of the NMBI; (13) Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith - the post office network uncertainty; (14) Deputy James Lawless - inconsistencies in commercial rates system from valuations in REVAL2017; and (15) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - funding for Dalkey school project, Glenageary.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Pat Casey; Pat Buckley and Billy Kelleher; Joan Burton, Clare Daly and Catherine Connolly; and Eamon Scanlon have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200022#U00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed) - Priority Questions","time":1492005900,"counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200023#V00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","time":1492005900,"counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200023#V00300"},{"type":"question","time":1492005900,"counter":349,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[18552\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200023#V00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the rights of 1.8 million persons in Northern Ireland to EU citizenship under the Good Friday Agreement will be protected in full after Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Some of these fora were developed in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and some of them were established more recently or have evolved and developed over the years to reflect the close relationship between these islands.  They all will be used to the full, not least given the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.<\/p><p>These channels include the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and a formal process established in 2012 involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a joint work programme managed at official level by the heads of all Departments in both Dublin and London.<\/p><p>At political level, there are ongoing and frequent contacts across all policy areas.  In addition to regular meetings the Taoiseach and I would have with our counterparts, Government colleagues meeting their UK counterparts recently have included the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p>In terms of our diplomatic resources, our embassy in London is and will remain our largest bilateral embassy in the world.  In fact, given the UK exit from the European Union and with a view towards helping to strengthen bilateral links in a post-Brexit context, two additional diplomatic officers have been assigned to the embassy in London.  We also have a consulate general in Edinburgh, for which I approved an additional diplomat in 2015, while the footprint of our trade, tourism and investment agencies in Britain is and will continue to be significant.<\/p><p>Regarding formal structures, the next summit of the British-Irish Council, BIC, is scheduled to take place in Northern Ireland in June of this year, with the previous meeting having taken place in Cardiff in November last.  BIC meetings such as these provide Ireland with valuable opportunities to engage with devolved Administrations in the UK, while there are 12 specific work sectors being addressed at ministerial and official level all year round.  The summit meetings since the UK referendum have also included specific sessions on Brexit, in doing so, reflecting a capacity for flexibility in issues being discussed at them.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In terms of individual devolved Administrations, I point to the fact that the Irish Government has taken particular care to maintain close contacts with the Scottish and Welsh Governments, with the First Minister, Ms Sturgeon, visiting Dublin in November 2016 and the Taoiseach meeting the Welsh First Minister, Mr. Carwyn Jones, in Cardiff last month.<\/p><p>The formal structures also include the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which comes within the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement and whose function is to bring together the British and Irish Governments to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.<\/p><p>The conference has traditionally focused on issues of mutual concern relating to Northern Ireland where its remit is non-devolved matters, that is, those which are reserved to the British Government and Westminster rather than the Northern Ireland Executive and assembly.  As the scope of non-devolved matters in Northern Ireland has become quite narrow over recent years, there has been no business need for the conference to meet at political level.  However, its secretariat &ndash; made up of Irish and British civil servants - continues to be an important day-to-day channel of contact between both Governments and the Irish officials assigned to the secretariat constitute the Irish Government presence in Belfast.<\/p><p>Parliamentary links are also vitally important and will be more crucial than ever once the UK departs from the EU.  I myself will be delivering an address at the next plenary meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, to be held in Kilkenny in May 2017.  This Assembly and its committees meet regularly to examine areas of shared importance across the member jurisdictions - Ireland, the UK, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and what are known as the Crown dependencies - and this includes Brexit.  I am also heartened by the regular interaction between other parliamentary committees, which is to be welcomed and encouraged as the withdrawal process continues.<\/p><p>Overall, as Deputies can see from what I have set out, there are extensive arrangements for dialogue with Britain - including ones which offer flexibility in terms of management and policy focus.  We will, of course, keep matters under review, including as the details of the UK's new relationship with the EU emerge in the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200024#W00800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1492006500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I am quite disappointed with the Minister's response.<\/p>  <p>  Our shared membership of the Union has given both countries a space to build and consolidate trust and to work in a formal way but with Britain's exit, that is at risk.

The case has seen more high level political engagement, more investment of person-hours, more consultation with third parties worldwide and more consular visits and court hearing observation missions undertaken than in any other case to which the Irish Government has ever responded.  This is in light of the unique circumstances of the case, in particular the fact that the citizen concerned was a minor at the time of his arrest.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has repeatedly and consistently called on the Egyptian authorities to allow this citizen to return to his family and his home in Ireland.  We have supported legal petitions for this man to be returned to Ireland under Egyptian Law 140, we have appealed for him to be considered for release under the Egyptian President's so-called youth amnesty scheme and we have stressed in all contacts the humanitarian dimensions of the case as grounds under which we believe he should be released.  The Taoiseach, as the House is aware, has in recent days renewed the Government's appeal to the Egyptian President to release this Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay, stressing in particular the humanitarian dimensions of the case.  This is the Government's objective, and we are working day-in, day-out to seek that outcome.<\/p>  <p>  I repeated this position when I met my Egyptian counterpart, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shoukry, again last month.  In recent days, I have also spoken at length with the EU High Representative, Ms Mogherini, about the case and availed of the opportunity of my meeting with the Secretary General of the Arab League, who is also a former Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, to enlist his assistance in trying to persuade the Egyptian authorities to release our citizen.<\/p>  <p>  The court case in which this person is accused is now moving forward, and recent hearings have been more substantive with shorter periods between court sittings.  At the most recent hearing, on 5 April, 11 more witnesses were called and cross-examined and gave evidence.  This is important because the Egyptian authorities have consistently said that President el-Sisi and his Government cannot intervene in a case that is before the courts and that the President will only intervene when the trial has ended.<\/p>  <p>  It is also noteworthy that at that most recent hearing the lawyers representing our Irish citizen made a request for his release on health grounds and the presiding judge undertook to examine the matter.  The same judge has previously ordered on a number of occasions that there should be medical evaluations of this man's health.  The next hearing of the case is scheduled to take place on 26 April.  Officials from the Irish Embassy will again be in court to observe proceedings, as they have been at every hearing of the case to date.<\/p>  <p>  For my part, I will continue to work urgently at political level to maintain pressure on the Egyptian Government to release our citizen and allow him to return to his home and his family at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200025#X01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1492007100,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I join the Minister in condemning the terrorist attacks on the Coptic churches in Egypt.<\/p>  <p>  It is not surprising that more hours have gone into this case than others because Mr. Halawa has been in prison for three and a half years.

The problem is that nothing that has been done so far, including the parliamentary delegation of which I was a part, has worked in releasing our citizen home.  What more does the Government intend to do?  Was the European External Action Service in attendance at the most recent court case?  If not, why not?  Are there countries that continue to block the attendance of the EEAS, and is the Government making particular efforts to discuss with those Governments the withdrawal of any such block?<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is that it is all very well for el-Sisi to tell us that he will not release Mr. Halawa until the court case is over, but the court case can go on indefinitely and each court appearance that passes seems to have a bad impact on Ibrahim's spirit, understandably, because the case just seems to stretch indefinitely into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200025#X01900","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1492007700,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that the Government continues to pursue every constructive avenue to achieve the citizen's return to Ireland and we will continue to bring our influence to bear on his behalf through all appropriate channels.

Our priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall integrity of the settlement are not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  All provisions of the agreement must be respected, including those relating to human rights.<\/p>  <p>  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, including through the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.  It is important to be clear that the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, is separate and distinct to the European Union.  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the ECHR.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I welcome the clarification in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on withdrawal from the EU where it states specifically that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of British Government proposals, not connected with Brexit, to repeal the UK Human Rights Act and to introduce a domestic bill of rights, the Government has consistently emphasised to the British Government the importance of fully meeting its human rights obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I would note that while a domestic bill of rights can complement incorporation of the convention, it does not replace it.  The British Government has indicated that it is not currently pursuing a repeal of its Human Rights Act.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.<\/p>  <p>  On 13 February, I convened a sectoral dialogue on human rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South, on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the agreement.  This was a valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, including the importance of upholding the Good Friday Agreement chapter on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, as an integral part of the agreement as a whole; the value of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement, in mitigating some of the potential impacts of Brexit for Northern Ireland; and the value of a charter of rights for the island of Ireland as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement.  This would also support the provision in the agreement on equivalence of rights on the island.  Each of these themes demonstrates that human rights are central to the peace process and must be protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 February, I held a bilateral meeting in Dublin with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.  I reminded him of the unique circumstances that pertain to Northern Ireland, given the political and constitutional settlement of the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, I noted to the Secretary of State the range of issues raised in the aforementioned sectoral dialogue on the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I emphasised to the Secretary of State the duty on both Governments to ensure the integrity of the agreement in this and all other aspects, whatever the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union might be.<\/p>  <p>  Human rights are central to the peace process and must be fully protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status in the EU.  The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.  This includes the continued incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200027#Z00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1492008300,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his positive response and his own personal commitment to safeguarding those provisions in the Good Friday Agreement.

The specific provision provides for a joint committee of representatives of the two human rights commissions, North and South, as a forum for consideration of human rights issues on the island of Ireland.  The joint committee will consider, among other matters, the possibility of establishing a charter open to signature by all democratic political parties, reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of fundamental rights for everyone living on the island.<\/p>  <p>  That was a positive measure in the Good Friday Agreement and we can now see how important it was to have it there.

The British Government expressly indicated that the provisions of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in Northern Ireland will not be applied as part of British law after the UK leaves the EU.  This may require that a consideration may be given to alternative means of ensuring the coherence of rights frameworks across the island of Ireland.  This was a key theme of the sectoral dialogue in Maynooth and I am pleased that the Deputy's party was represented at that conference.  The value of a charter of rights for the island of Ireland, as referred to in the Good Friday Agreement, would also support the provision in the agreement on the matter of equivalence of rights across the island. <\/p>  <p>  My priority at all times is to ensure that all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement are respected, not only here but also in the context of the UK-EU negotiations.

In that regard I need to stress that the UK has confirmed that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, which is at the core of the human rights pillar of the Good Friday Agreement.  Essentially, while the legal obligations provided for under the Agreement in respect of human rights remain unchanged, the UK's departure from the Union changes the context in which those obligations operate.  There will need to be an element of work undertaken to ensure that nothing adversely affects the human rights guarantees in the Good Friday Agreement and that the confidence and trust of all sides of the community in Northern Ireland is not in any way adversely impacted upon.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to raise this issue.

A total of almost 750,000 applications was received in 2016.  This was an increase of more than 9% over 2015.  Between 1 January and 31 March this year, over 250,000 applications were received, which represented an increase of 26% over the same period last year.  There are a number of factors behind these increases.  The decision by the UK to leave the European Union has undoubtedly had an impact but so too has an expanding population and an increase in outbound travel in recent years.  The passport service's stated aim is to process passport renewal applications within 15 working days of receipt, provided that the documentation is in order.  Applicants are advised that the turnaround time will vary depending on factors such as seasonal demand.  Turnaround times for each category of applicant are updated every week on the passport service website.  Despite the high volumes, the target turnaround time of 15 working days was met in almost 90% of cases last year and it is just over the target - by one day - in recent weeks.  First-time applications are subject to longer turnaround times due to the extra verifications involved to protect the integrity of this important document.  The current turnaround time for first-time applications is 24 working days.  In all cases, as a matter of best practice, applicants are advised to allow at least six weeks for the processing of a passport and to use the passport express service only if they have no immediate travel plans. <\/p><p>The exceptional level of demand is likely be sustained into the summer months and we have worked hard to put in place a number of measures, including additional staffing resources, to mitigate the impact.

Both Governments are agreed on the imperative of continued devolved power sharing Government for Northern Ireland, which is at the core of the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>The Secretary of State confirmed in his statement to the House of Commons on 28 March that the British Government does not want to see a return to direct rule in Northern Ireland.  I welcome this confirmation and I reiterate today in this House, as I have to the Secretary of State, that this Government does not support the suspension of the institutions and the return of direct rule in Northern Ireland.  It is important to note that there is no statutory provision at Westminster for the suspension of the institutions, following its removal, which at the time was supported by the Irish Government, as part of the St. Andrews Agreement, more than ten years ago.  The political process in Northern Ireland is founded on the institutions, principles, procedures and practices of the Good Friday Agreement, including the Assembly and the Executive, and it is imperative that both Governments and all the parties work in support of this framework.<\/p><p>In this context I am representing the Government in the intensive talks in Belfast.  These talks have two objectives.  First, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Second, to address the implementation of the outstanding issues from previous agreements.  These discussions are structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments following on from the talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the setting up of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.<\/p><p>Overall, encouraging progress is being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding.  Serious issues remain to be resolved after the Easter holidays, including those which were to the fore before the collapse of the last Executive and during the election campaign.  However, with resolve and determination from all the parties involved in the process, and with the support and encouragement of the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on formation of the Executive as soon as possible so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance.<\/p><p>As the formal talks pause briefly for Easter, I encourage everyone to maintain informal contacts and to reflect on what can be achieved if, in the weeks ahead, an Executive is established that operates effectively and sustainably.  I am convinced that all parties are willing to play their part in reaching such a sustainable agreement, which will provide for a stable power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>The Irish Government as a co-guarantor of that Agreement and the peace process will continue to play its part in facilitating these ongoing talks, working with the British Government and encouraging all parties to reach agreement on the formation of a new Executive that is demonstrably in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200030#CC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1492010100,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed at the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in in particular appears to have called for another election.

This Friday we will attend the anniversary of the Belfast Agreement.  Most commentators are saying that there appears to be relatively little energy or appetite on the part of either of the two major parties, the Democratic Unionist Party but particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, to make the institutions work, a rather fatalistic approach that it is okay to return to direct rule but that the preference is for further elections.  I have no real idea other than head counting what another election might produce.  Has the Minister spoken to each of the parties about that?  Does he have a sense of what they believe a further election might achieve?  Talking to ordinary people from the North who are not particularly political I found that they are completely confused.

There are hundreds of service users and their families requiring the services of Sunbeam House Services throughout Wicklow but particularly in facilities in Bray, Wicklow and Arklow.  Needless to say, any organisation providing such services needs to be fully transparent and provide a service that has the full confidence of the service users, their families, the front-line staff and the State agencies that act on behalf of the taxpayer who fund these services.<\/p>  <p>  Recent and routine HIQA inspections have found failings in the operations at Sunbeam House Services which, along with family and staff complaints, have led to a recent assurance review by the HSE that again has found failings in the operations of Sunbeam House Services.  The report refers to 284 separate complaints being registered against Sunbeam House Services between January 2013 and September 2016.  Concerned family members have been in contact with me since July 2016 about their serious complaints and concerns.  I have attempted to get answers to very serious allegations including the mistreatment of service users and serious failings in management at Sunbeam House Services.  I have been attempting to do this without increasing further the anxiety to the family members of service users and to the service users of other Wicklow based organisations that may be involved in a proposed merger with Sunbeam House Services.  Information supplied to me by concerned families suggests that long-serving social workers and a senior medical doctor involved with Sunbeam House Services have serious concerns about the procedures, care services and management at Sunbeam.<\/p>  <p>  The removal of the assurance report from the HSE website has convinced me that I needed to bring these issues directly to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and for a publicly accountable response on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am also concerned about the apparent lack of a protected disclosures policy at Sunbeam House Services.  Given the responsibility of care given to any organisation providing services to adults with intellectual disabilities, the absence of such a policy is, quite simply, disgraceful.  The families need to know if protected disclosures have been made to the HSE or to Sunbeam House Services, the number and gravity of such disclosures and the response to such disclosures, including reporting to the Garda where required.<\/p>  <p>  Transparency and accountability in the provision of care services should be front and centre in every organisation providing such services to the most vulnerable members of our community.  I am shocked about what is contained in the reports and how the reports have been removed from the website.  From my contact with some families I know they have been very reluctant to go public because of a deep seated fear that their loved ones' level of service may be affected.  The fact that family members of service users are living in fear is enough of a disgrace to warrant a serious, rapid and public response from the HSE and from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200032#EE00500","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1492011300,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I wish to thank Deputy Casey sincerely for raising this important issue.  I know it is of great concern to the families affected, many of whom I have had an opportunity to meet, correspond and talk with - as the Deputy has.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to begin by reiterating that the Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people who are in the care of the health service, and I appreciate that the Deputy has outlined this also as his ongoing priority.  This includes those people who avail of services provided by voluntary organisations such as the service provider in question.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from his work in Wicklow, Sunbeam House Services is a voluntary organisation providing a wide range of services across east Wicklow and south County Dublin to adults with intellectual disabilities.  It is supported financially by the Health Service Executive and received core funding of &euro;24.1 million in 2016.  I am very aware of the broad range of supports that Sunbeam House Services has been providing to date for people who have a disability.  These services include residential places to those with intellectual disabilities, rehabilitation training places, day services to over 300 clients and home support services to a cohort of 42 adults.  It also supports nine respite beds, providing more than 800 places to 51 service users each quarter of each year.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately I am also aware that a number of serious issues of concern have been raised by families of service users attending Sunbeam House Services.  On foot of these concerns, an externaI assurance review of the systems of governance and management in Sunbeam House Services was recently commissioned by the chief officer of the HSE community health care organisation, CHO 6.  I very much welcome that this was an external review because this was important for providing reassurance to families that this would be an external review; someone from outside to look at these issues.  The review focused on Sunbeam House Services governance and management structures in respect of the management of complaints, the management of incidents, the management of protected disclosures and the implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s national safeguarding of vulnerable adults policy.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this process, a review was undertaken of the independent regulator HIQA&rsquo;s inspection reports on Sunbeam House Services disability residential centres.  I understand that in addition the review process involved interviews with families who had raised complaints and concerns.  There was also a consultation with service users, because it is important that the voice of the service user is heard in this process, and meetings with staff focus groups.<\/p>  <p>  The review team has now finalised its formal written report in line with its terms of reference.  I wish to be clear that I consider the issues to be extremely serious and I have engaged closely with senior management of the HSE regarding the review report.  I have stressed the need to ensure that an appropriate implementation plan is put in place as a matter of priority and I understand this is currently being finalised.  I will be meeting with HSE management to focus specifically on this issue and I intend to meet tomorrow with representatives of families who have raised concerns.  I have been, and will continue to be, very clear that I want to see all recommendations of the report acted upon quickly and any further actions that may be required to be followed up without delay.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion I wish to assure Deputy Casey that I and my Department will continue to maintain close contact with the HSE with a view to ensuring that all necessary service improvements across the range of services provided by Sunbeam House Services are instigated as soon as possible.  I also want to thank the families for coming forward and highlighting these very important issues.  If it was not for the families then we would not have the body of knowledge which merited the external review.  My assurance to them today on the floor of the D&aacute;il is that each and every one of the recommendations in the report must be implemented by the HSE and by Sunbeam House Services.  I expect the HSE to get on with ensuring the implementation plan is in place as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200032#EE00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1492011300,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to answer the question himself.

There needs to be a rapid, time-bound approach to every single recommendation contained within the reports into Sunbeam House Services.

I have been involved with advocating for people with disabilities in County Wicklow since my teenage years.  I have absolutely no intention of allowing a report that has been commissioned and that has made very clear and stark recommendations to sit on a shelf.  It is my absolute determination that the HSE will deliver what Deputy Casey rightfully calls for, namely, a very public response in terms of an implementation plan that shows exactly how we are going to deliver on all of the improvements the report seeks in respect of Sunbeam House Services.<\/p>  <p>  For quite a period, parents have been highlighting concerns about a number of issues at Sunbeam House Services.  It is my absolute view that the report vindicates those concerns.  I understand the HSE published the report online and that it was subsequently taken down, and that there is some legal or administrative reason for this.  The main comfort I take is that the parents have the report.  It has been circulated because many parents got it from the website and they have seen it.  I am sure Deputy Casey has seen it.  I have seen it.  There is no doubt about the body of work that needs to be done.  I agree with the Deputy about the need to hold off on any merger until all of these issues have been fully resolved.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the staff in Sunbeam House Services have been doing Trojan work at different levels and in a variety of roles.  There is a clear need for improvement and things have gone wrong.  The report leaves us in no doubt of that.  However, for the people who work in Sunbeam House Services and do their very best to provide a good service, for the parents who advocate on behalf of their service users and for the families, I really believe that by working together we can make this an organisation that delivers the type of service we want to see in Wicklow and south Dublin, and one of which everybody can be proud.  The report is the beginning of that process and stands as an important roadmap for the improvements we need to see.  Now the HSE and Sunbeam need to get on with delivering it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200033#FF00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","time":1492011900,"counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200033#FF00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1492011900,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Buckley wants to accommodate Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and that Deputy Kelleher has no difficulty with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200033#FF00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1492011900,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Last Monday, it was reported in the press that there were no child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, available in emergency departments in Cork.

At that time, responding in Leaders' Questions in respect of the issue, the Taoiseach led us to believe that no stone would be left unturned and that every effort would be made to ensure that all resources would be provided to resolve the crisis.  Nonetheless, we see a situation in which one of the most fundamental and crucial mental health services for children and adolescents in Cork has been found wanting and left short.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200033#FF00600","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1492011900,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I will read an extract from a letter that was circulated to general practitioners from the mental health Cork and Kerry HSE offices:<\/p><blockquote>In recent weeks, it has been increasingly difficult to maintain out-of-hours, on-call services at the two Cork city emergency departments along with the out-of-hours service to &Eacute;ist Linn, the CAMHS in-patient unit.

Some of the replies I have got back to recent parliamentary questions are quite alarming in terms of the length of time people are waiting for services from CAMHS in the region.  Beyond that, it is also a major national problem.  I know there is extreme difficulty in recruiting at non-consultant hospital doctor and consultant level.  I accept that.  However, this has been on the cards for some time.  We have been raising the matter for a number of years.  We knew there were going to be huge difficulties because of the slow recruitment process.  Now that is evidenced on a daily basis in Cork and Kerry and throughout the country.<\/p><p>A general practitioner said he had an extremely vulnerable 14 year old and a 15 year old whom he could not refer to the emergency department as there was no CAMHS support available.  While I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to this area, we do need to expedite the recruitment of clinical personnel to ensure we do not have a situation in which vulnerable children are waiting up to a year for assessment and supports.

I share their concerns, as do the people who are providing the service.  They understand the difficulty they are facing and the impact it is having on the young people in the area.<\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of the HSE, under its annual service plan, to provide an age-appropriate mental health service for those under the age of 18.  Mental health remains a key care programme priority for this Government, reflected by the fact that the HSE mental health budget increased from around &euro;826 million in 2016 to approximately &euro;853 million this year.  The HSE service plan for 2017 commits to further development of child and adolescent mental health services, including better out-of-hours liaison and seven-day response services.  This is a strategic priority action in the plan, against a background where the population of children is expected to increase by over 8,500 in the period 2016 to 2017, thereby creating additional demand on CAMHS.  Approximately 18,500 referrals are expected to HSE CAMHS services this year alone.<\/p>  <p>  CAMHS has been prioritised in new funding made available by the Government since 2012.  Additional resources and facilities mean there are now 67 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams, supported by 66 operational CAMHS beds nationally with further beds planned to come on stream in the near future.  CAMHS services in Cork have eight community-based teams.  Two of the teams have consultant vacancies, namely team C - Western Road, and North Lee North.  Team C has had a vacant psychology post since Christmas 2016, but the executive recently secured a person to fill this post.  There have been widely acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists, which all of the Deputies have recognised.  Recruitment efforts have been ongoing including local and international advertising for a locum consultant in Cork, which have not yielded any success.  Unfortunately, there is currently a serious shortage of suitably qualified CAMHS consultants at both national and European level.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is working to provide the best possible service within available staffing resources.  A key focus is on managing clinical risks and prioritising referrals accordingly.  All efforts are being made to support teams with additional therapy and administrative resources, notwithstanding the consultant vacancy, to ensure that the best possible service is provided.  The rest of the multi-disciplinary team associated with team C continues to provide a service to those deemed within their scope of practice.  Unfortunately, however, those requiring consultant or psychologist review are currently on a waiting list.  The HSE acknowledges that the lack of consultant cover is having a considerable impact on access to the service locally.  It is working to explore all avenues for the recruitment of qualified staff to fill vacancies and to replace staff retiring or resigning, particularly in areas such as consultant, psychologist and nursing posts.<\/p><p>I have spoken to Sinead Glennon, head of mental health services in the Cork-Kerry area.  I absolutely believe that every stone is being turned and every possible avenue is being looked at to try to fill these posts and cover weekends or various parts of the day.  Bearing in mind all of the circumstances, I am satisfied the HSE is making every effort to address this, including the prioritising of cases based on assessed professional need.  In other words, I am assured that urgent cases are being prioritised and seen within the recommended level of time.

She was asked to give a report on the work of the commission and why there was a delay.  Pressure was put on the Minister to publish a report and to give maximum information.  We asked the Minister whether she knew about briefing documents at the highest level.  We asked factual questions relating to the site in Tuam being a crime scene.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has come back and talked about waffly consultation.  We do not know where it will start or who the stakeholders are.  The Minister is not giving us a date for the scoping exercise to extend the terms of reference.  The Minister has put in transitional justice that no one has sought.  The Minister is talking about Caranua version two when Caranua itself is in serious trouble.  Reference has been made to the most appalling distinction between accompanied mother and unaccompanied mothers.

Following a short first interim report last July, the commission submitted a second interim report in September 2016.  This report deals with a number of issues that had come to its attention during its work and analysis based on information collected up to August 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I published the second interim report of the commission.  It is now available on my Department's website.  I have been mindful of the time it has taken to publish this report.  It has, however, been necessary for me to engage with Cabinet colleagues on issues in the report that extend beyond my remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>  <p>  The focus in this report is on children who were unaccompanied by their mothers in mother and baby homes and county homes.  In its interim report published yesterday, the commission suggests that the exclusion of children who were resident in mother and baby homes and in county homes without their mothers from the residential institutions redress scheme, which was established in 2002, should be re-examined.  The report states that the commission is satisfied that the institutions it is investigating are unquestionably the main such homes that existed during the 20th century.  It does not currently recommend that other institutions be investigated.  The commission is not recommending any changes to its terms of reference at this time.  It may recommend further investigations when its current investigation is completed.  It has not made findings to date that abuse occurred in these institutions but notes that its work is not yet complete.<\/p><p>The commission also recognises that people whose births were falsely registered have a need to establish their identities but that the false registration of births is a very difficult issue to investigate because of a lack of accurate records.<\/p> <p> The Government has carefully examined the commission&rsquo;s recommendation regarding redress, and has concluded that it is not possible to implement it.  As Deputies will be aware, the residential institutions redress scheme has been closed since 2010.  Following the publication of the Ryan report in May 2009, there was a range of requests and calls for the redress scheme to be extended.  The then Government took a decision in 2010 not to extend the scheme.  The Government in 2013 also decided not to extend the scheme.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said he found no basis to revisit the decision. <\/p> <p> This Government is conscious that the commission has made no findings to date regarding abuse or neglect and believes it would not be appropriate to deal with the question of redress in advance of any conclusions on this issue by the commission.  The challenges for Government in considering the recommendations of the commission at this interim stage of its work are clear from the findings of this report.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember that the commission&rsquo;s investigations are ongoing.  The Commission&rsquo;s final report is due in February next year.  Its conclusions on this and all matters regarding the treatment of former residents will be studied very carefully at that point.  My focus now is on assisting those who were unaccompanied as children in mother and baby homes and county homes, with a view to offering supports that will be of genuine and practical value to them.  With this in mind, I will consult with them regarding the nature and type of services and supports in the area of health and well-being that they consider would be helpful to them at this stage.  I will conclude this consultation by the end of June, and bring proposals to Government before the summer break, so that we can have appropriate supports in place as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> My Department is working with Tusla to support the provision of information to assist former residents who may wish to establish when they resided in a mother and baby home.  I have asked Dr. James Gallen of the school of law and government, Dublin City University, to assist by mapping out a model of transitional justice.  This would be a means of giving a voice to former residents of mother and baby homes and county homes.  Dr. Gallen&rsquo;s expertise in transitional justice will help to develop an approach.<\/p> <p> I am also carrying out a scoping exercise to examine the possibility of broadening the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference.  This report is very helpful in focusing us on what may possibly emerge in the final report from the commission of investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200034#GG01600","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492013100,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The Minister must have had a very bad day at Cabinet yesterday because of the briefing around the story and the unnamed coward of a Minister who would not actually put his or her name to what he or she said on the front page of a national newspaper.

I accept and hear what the Deputy is saying, but I just do not have any comment on that.  I wish to say very clearly that in terms of the Government's response, it does not mean we have closed off redress for those who have been in mother and baby homes.  When the commission finishes its investigations, social history and confidential committee of hearing evidence and makes recommendation to Government, it is then we will have the opportunity to consider redress for those people in those institutions, irrespective of whether that is a part of the recommendations.  It is at that stage the commission will have the opportunity to identify whether there are any findings of abuse in the formal process that has been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  I hear what Deputy Daly is saying about the extension of the terms of reference.  I committed to looking at that and I am doing so.  Deputy Daly talked about listening to survivors, or residents.  Some of the people with whom I have spoken to prefer to call themselves residents as distinct from survivors.  The Deputy said that what they want is an apology.  I spoke with a survivor or resident yesterday who does not want an apology.  Instead, what she wants is the Head of State to ask for their forgiveness.  She sees that as different from an apology.  Therefore, I understand that there are lots of different issues that people are seeking to be addressed.  Part of the reason for establishing an approach to take a look at the wider ways of listening to what people want, which is part of what is transitional justice, is because of that diversity and the importance of trying to identify it.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Connolly, I listened very carefully in terms of the meetings on Tuam that were requested.  I have received many submissions and have already written letters that are being sent back on how we will progress the different issues that arose.  As the Deputy knows, one of the aspects specifically has to do with access to information.  That is something about which I spoke in my response to the interim report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200035#HH01300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Service Staff","time":1492013100,"counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200035#HH01400"},{"type":"speech","time":1492013100,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to raise what I believe is a very important issue.  With the increasing numbers of older people in the country, a demand for long-serving staff naturally increases.  We need as many of our most experienced staff to stay in practice as long as possible.  Surely, what we should be doing is incentivising them to work for longer.<\/p><p>People are living longer, as can be seen in the changes in the population aged over 65, which has increased by 19.1% since 2011.  Every year in Ireland older workers are forced out of their jobs for no other reason than that they reach a certain age.<\/p> <p> Some two thirds of firefighters in Ireland are retained firefighters who are not full-time but who are fully trained and paid on a per-call basis.  Most firefighters in small towns and villages would work in that retained system.  The normal retirement age is 55, but firefighters who are physically capable of working beyond the preferred age of 55 have an extended optional period in which to exit the service, subject to certain conditions.  Such firefighters have the option to continue working for a defined limited period, subject to compulsory annual medical assessment measured against agreed standards.  The extended optional period is up to 58 years.  There are retained firefighters throughout the country who would like to see this period extended to 60, and I believe they should have that option.<\/p> <p> I appreciate that an agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved, SIPTU and the ATGWU, in November 2002, but that is 15 years ago.  From that process, an expert group's report on retirement age recommended that the retirement age for the retained firefighters should remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age.<\/p> <p> Firefighters, like members of the Garda, should have the option to continue to serve until they reach 60 years of age.  Mandatory retirement ages, set arbitrarily on the basis of the worker having lived for a set number of years and not on his or her capability to do the job, constitute a kind of barrier to an age-friendly society.  There is evidence that longer working lives have beneficial effects on individuals' physical and psychological well-being.  Evidence also shows that workers' productivity does not necessarily decline with age and any decline in physical capacity is easily compensated by qualities and skills acquired through many years of experience.<\/p> <p> Mandatory retirement ages take out a significant amount of fire service expertise and leave fire departments that struggle with recruitment and retention.  I recognise the rigours of the job and I support the health and safety aspect of legislation, but all firefighters should be treated equally in terms of health and safety, regardless of age.  Retained firefighters who are physically capable of working beyond the age of 55 should have the option to continue working until 60, subject to compulsory annual medical assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200035#HH01500","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492013700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising this important issue and I understand his reasons for bringing it forward.  Fire services, in all their facets, are delivered by people.  On behalf of the Government, I want to recognise the contribution that all staff in the fire services, both the retained services and the full-time services in Dublin city, make in protecting our communities.  I talk to them a lot and I understand the work they do, which they take very seriously at all levels.  The Deputy is right that they are constantly updating their skills and trying to push themselves to new levels of expertise.  They are genuine in their work and always want to help and serve, which is what they are there for.  Over the years, fire services have evolved to give us the quality services we have today, which continue to drive down the annual toll of fire related deaths, injuries and damage.<\/p><p>Fire authorities are subject to legislation as employers in their statutory roles of providing fire services.  It is expected that fire services in Ireland will facilitate and provide effective intervention in accordance with the dual statutory responsibilities of fire authorities to protect people and property from fire and also to protect their own employees.  This objective presents the challenge of ensuring that personnel achieve and maintain the necessary competence for the range of roles and activities they may be designated to undertake.  As I said, I have witnessed them involved in continuing training and education to enhance their skills.<\/p><p>International research indicates that a retirement age of 55 is the optimum age to ensure firefighters are capable of satisfactorily performing the tasks expected of them.  The retirement age of 55 years was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job.  Since the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and under subsequent legislation, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.  A full-time firefighter is statutorily required to retire at age 55 under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  This retirement age reflects the physically demanding nature of the firefighter role.  The retirement age for retained firefighters is 55, with an extended period to age 58, subject to a formal application process, including a compulsory medical assessment.<\/p><p>A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved, SIPTU and the ATGWU, in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided,<i>inter alia<\/i>, for the appointment of an expert group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters.  The expert group's report on retirement age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age.  Following the report of the expert group, published in April 2003, a circular was issued by the Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in regard to retained firefighters in line with the expert report.<\/p><p>In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established industrial relations processes.  Our fire services are evolving and remain an essential service which plays a vital role both in local communities and nationally.  My Department wants to ensure that this service is provided efficiently, safely and with due regard given to the terms and conditions applying to fire authority employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1492013700,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to the Minister of State's response.  What he said is fact but the case I am making is that these people are well qualified, well trained and keep themselves up to date on all the new ways of dealing with fire.  Nobody truly appreciates the work they do until the fire service is needed.  The efficient way they carry out their work deserves great credit.<\/p>  <p>  The rules and regulations on retirement are 15 years old.  We are told nowadays that 60 is the new 50, so these people are well capable of working for longer.  If the same rules applied here in the D&aacute;il, to myself in particular, there would be far fewer people around the D&aacute;il.  As it stands, however, nobody can say we do not do our jobs as best we can.  These firefighters are fit to carry on their work, subject to medical examination, and this should be considered.  At the time these regulations were brought in, such people could claim their pension at 65 years of age but some will now have to wait until they are 67, 68 or 69, so they will be ten years retired and still not able to get an old age pension.  This is wrong and should be looked at.

However, it is not something that has been brought to my attention on a larger scale, either by the unions or management.  It is an issue on which I can do a bit more digging.  I recognise that the retirement age is a conversation that is happening in regard to many jobs, but there is an extra dimension to this job, given the physical demands on firefighters.  That is why the expert panel relied on international best practice.  It was not dreamed up and there was a sound basis to it.  Nonetheless, I have no problem in digging a bit behind that because I am conscious that, as the Deputy said, it is 15 years since the decision was made.  While there has not been a clamour for this to be looked at, as the Deputy has asked the question, I will ask around and see if there have been changes in other countries that we might need to follow.  We relied on best practice at that time and I will make sure that has not changed in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to pensions, I must check the point but I would imagine they are entitled to certain parts of their pension related to their job, if not the State pension.  That is also something we can look at.  I understand the spirit in which the Deputy has raised the point and I will give due consideration to whether it is appropriate to look at this again and perhaps set up a new expert panel.  If it is, we will do that, but it might not be appropriate just yet.  We will look at what is happening in other countries and then come to a decision.
