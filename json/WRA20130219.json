The\u00a0overall target\u00a0is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. Assuming this target is achieved, it will generate an additional &euro;170 million in revenue for the Irish economy this year, based on historic spending patterns. \u00a0The 2013 Estimates allocations to Failte Ireland include a special provision of &euro;7 million which\u00a0was specifically provided for The Gathering. This amount is to be used exclusively to fund the promotion, development and legacy of the event.<\/p><p>  The general response from the public and tourism stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. There are now over 3,000 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year. Along with well-established events and festivals, we are also supporting a specially\u00a0targeted set of\u00a0events for the Gathering, such as\u00a0the very successful New Year's Eve Event in Dublin which marked the start of the festivities.<\/p><p>  Obviously the ambitious targets for overseas visits and associated revenue can only be achieved if people in our main source tourism markets are aware of the initiative. Tourism Ireland continues to\u00a0mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to the people across the world that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. The agency is undertaking cooperative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer. Print, online and TV advertising is also being used to promote the initiative while the upcoming programme of overseas Ministerial visits during the St. Patrick's Day period will again be used to highlight this special year for Irish tourism.<\/p><p>  While progress to date has been encouraging,\u00a0I believe that\u00a0all tourism stakeholders\u00a0must continue to work hard\u00a0to ensure that our targets are achieved.\u00a0\u00a0I have said previously that\u00a0the benefits of participation in the event will also have longer term positive consequences\u00a0in terms of additional annual\u00a0events as well as the strengthened connections being\u00a0estabished as a result of the initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900069#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1074"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Licences","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900069#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[8326\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900069#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of agent network locations that he is seeking to establish nationwide through SGS Ireland; the locations that have been agreed; if all agencies will be established by September 2013; if there will be any job creation in local areas from this distribution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>In May 2011, the Government decided to centralise the driver licence service under the Road Safety Authority (RSA).

I am very supportive of a number of the measures proposed including minimum pricing, health warning labels and statutory advertising codes. However, I am concerned that placing constraints on sporting organisations by eliminating the\u00a0alcohol industry as a source of sponsorship will have negative impacts on the development and availability of sport and consequently on our efforts to maintain and increase sporting participation at local level.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are huge and obvious economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport.\u00a0It is\u00a0very important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.<\/p><p><br \/>  In view of the current economic constraints,\u00a0Government investment in sport has had to be reduced in recent years.\u00a0The imposition of a ban on sponsorship would further undermine the efforts of sporting organisations to be self-sufficient.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is estimated that\u00a0sport sponsorship by the alcohol industry amounts to around &#8364;30m per year.\u00a0To place this in context, the Irish Sports Council&#8217;s budget is just over &#8364;40m. Difficulties currently being experienced by some of our\u00a0high profile teams and events in securing sponsorship suggest that the\u00a0funding lost might not readily be replaced\u00a0by alternative sources. Sports organisations\u00a0may\u00a0well be placed\u00a0in a position where they have to curtail their\u00a0development programmes, which are pivotal to promoting participation at all levels.<\/p><p><br \/>  I believe that any measures introduced should be evidence based, effective and proportionate. Furthermore, any decision in this area should have regard to the potential downsides that may occur. <\/p><p><br \/>  There is no\u00a0evidence to show that a ban on sponsorship\u00a0would\u00a0be effective in terms of reducing alcohol consumption amongst youths.

This report monitors substance use among 15&#8211;16-year-old European students in order to monitor trends within, as well as between, countries. Since 1999,\u00a0the proportion of these young people reporting having had five or more drinks on one occasion during the past 30 days in Ireland has decreased by 17%\u00a0to 40%. In comparison this has increased by 11% in France to 44%.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should be remembered that\u00a0Britain, having recognised the failure of the 'Loi Evin' in France to reduce alcohol consumption by young people, decided not to ban alcohol sponsorship of sport for evidence based reasons. We should not implement policies merely for the &#8216;optics&#8217; but we should only do so after an evidence based cost benefit analysis.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, it must be recognised that many of the\u00a0major sporting events in which Irish teams compete\u00a0are international events and are directly or indirectly broadcast into the State\u00a0by foreign broadcasters. Were Ireland to ban alcohol sponsorship, the only effect would be to exclude the Irish sporting organisations from sponsorship money while the advertising occurred anyway.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are also a number of practical difficulties\u00a0at a local level which must be considered, for example will pubs and hotels be allowed to sponsor teams? How will the\u00a0difficulties with sports which operate on an all- Ireland level be addressed?<\/p><p><br \/>  Instead of imposing\u00a0a ban on alcohol sponsorship,\u00a0my preference is for the introduction of a voluntary system, such as\u00a0currently\u00a0exists\u00a0in Australia, where the Department of Health would compensate sporting organisations who voluntarily give up such\u00a0sponsorship and moving to\u00a0the introduction of a ban only when it is shown that the money lost can be replaced through alternative sponsors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Certainly, I do not think that the government should impose such a law without fully compensating sports organisations for the revenue lost in the same way as we compensated political parties when corporate and private donations were restricted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900069#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Airport Development Projects","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[8496\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding the Shannon Aviation Services Centre Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[8463\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on the Shannon Aviation Services Centre Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1060","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[8601\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on the development of the new Shannon Airport Authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 119 and 145 together.<\/p><p>  As Deputies will be aware, Shannon Airport was separated from the Dublin Airport Authority on 31 December last and the assets and business of the airport were transferred from the DAA to the Shannon Airport Authority.<\/p><p>  My Department is working in conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the Heads of the new Bill to provide for the merger of the airport with a restructured Shannon Development in a new, commercial, State-owned entity and this legislation will be advanced during the first half of this year. When the Heads of the Bill are ready, they will be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport for their consideration prior to drafting.<\/p><p>  Last month I appointed Rose Hynes as Chairman of the SAA. On 23 January last, prior to her appointment, Ms Hynes appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications and outlined some of the challenges and opportunities facing the company.

While it is clearly early days, a number of airlines have announced plans for new or expanded services which augers well for the newly independent airport. To date, none of these have been displaced from other airports which is encouraging.<\/p><p>  In the meantime both I and my colleague, Minister Bruton, have written to the Chairmen of the SAA and Shannon Development requesting that they and their management teams work closely together over the coming months to ensure an orderly transition to the establishment of the new Shannon entity.

The Government&rsquo;s priorities for tourism\u00a0were outlined in the Programme for Government 2011.\u00a0 In the context of the challenges facing both the sector and the wider economy, rather than pursue separate strategies for the tourism sector, the Government integrated tourism into the broader economic strategic framework.\u00a0 This overall s approach, complemented by the work of the tourism agencies, has worked well to date.<\/p><p>  Key Programme for Government commitments were reflected in the Government&rsquo;s subsequent Jobs Initiative, with immediate priority actions set out in the annual Action Plans for Jobs.\u00a0 The Government has already delivered on several measures to reduce costs for tourists and for tourism businesses, therefore enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, and last week&rsquo;s Finance Bill provides a further stimulus for\u00a0the tourism sector.<\/p><p>  It is too early to comment on any specific treatment, in the\u00a0policy review, of particular markets such as Great Britain or of specific destinations such as Cork.\u00a0 In addition, it is important to distinguish what are essentially operational matters, such as the approach to the development of specific destinations or markets, from the higher-level policy priorities.\u00a0 Since specific marketing strategies for\u00a0Britain are an operational matter for Tourism Ireland Limited,\u00a0I have referred this aspect of Deputy McHugh's question\u00a0to Tourism Ireland for additional\u00a0material.\u00a0\u00a0Since the development of individual regions is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I have referred this aspect of Deputy Buttimer's question to\u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland\u00a0for direct reply. \u00a0In each case, please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Promotion","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[8461\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to tackle the decline in visitor numbers to here from the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[8545\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the action he will take to reverse the decline in visitor numbers from Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[8562\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900070#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he expects visitors from Britian to return in greater numbers in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 164 and 188 together.<\/p><p>  They relate to visitor numbers from the UK.<\/p><p>  According to the recently published CSO figures, there were just over 6.5 million overseas visits to Ireland last year representing an increase of 0.2% on 2011 levels.

The NESC provides guidance to Government on strategic issues for Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development. Since coming into office on 9 March 2011, I have made appointments to the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) as set out in the tables beneath.  The appointments are made in accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 and S.I. No. 603 of 2010, National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010.<\/p><p>I appoint members specifically on the basis of nominations from business and employer interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, farming and agricultural interests, the community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector.  I may also appoint up to six public servants of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance.  These appointments represent relevant Departments to ensure NESC's work is integrated with Government policy-making.  I also appointed eight independent members to the NESC in 2011, in most cases from the academic sector.  These appointments were made following careful consideration of the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to the functions of the Council as required by the legislation.<\/p><p>The Government has put new arrangements in place for the making of appointments to State boards.  In the particular case of the NESC, I should emphasise that most of the members of NESC are appointed on the basis of nominations received from representative organisations.  Historically, the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson posts are filled from my Department at Secretary General and Assistant Secretary level.  I am satisfied that the other appointments were appropriate, bearing in mind the key strategic role of the NESC.  However the option of utilising the new process for expressions of public interest will be considered when the next round of appointments of independent members to the NESC arises.<\/p><p>The only other relevant appointment was that of an   Assistant Secretary from my Department to the National Statistics Board (NSB) on 13 September 2012.  This appointment was made  in line with the provisions of Section 18 (1)(b) of the Statistics Act 1993, which provides for the appointment to the NSB of a representative of my Department at Assistant Secretary or higher grade.  My functions in relation to the NSB were delegated to the Government Chief Whip, Minister of State Paul Kehoe T.D., on 22 March 2011 who therefore made this appointment.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Details of appointments made by the Taoiseach to NESC since 9 March 2011 are set out in the table beneath.  <\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Name <\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Organisation <\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Date of <\/b><br \/><b>Appointment <\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Martin Fraser, Chairperson of NESC<\/td><td>Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach <\/td><td><div>August 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. John Shaw, Deputy Chairperson of NESC<\/td><td>Assistant Secretary, Department of the Taoiseach <\/td><td><div>January 2012<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Prof. Edgar Morgenroth<\/td><td>Associate Research Professor, Economic and Social Research Institute <\/td><td><div>June 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Prof. John McHale <\/td><td>Economist, National University of Ireland, Galway <\/td><td><div>June 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Prof. Mary Daly<\/td><td>Professor of Sociology and Social Policy, Senior Research Fellow of Green Templeton College, Department of Social Policy and Intervention, University of Oxford<\/td><td><div>June 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Prof. Anna Davis<\/td><td>Department of Geography, Trinity College Dublin<\/td><td><div>June 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Prof. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riain<\/td><td>Department of Sociology, National University of Ireland, Maynooth<\/td><td><div>June 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dr. Michael O&#8217;Sullivan<\/td><td>Head of Portfolio Strategy and Thematic Research, Credit Suisse, London<\/td><td><div>June 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ms. Mary Walsh <\/td><td>Chartered Accountant<\/td><td><div>June 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dr. Michelle Norris<\/td><td>Senior Lecturer, School of Applied Social Science, University College Dublin.<\/td><td><div>July 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Shay Cody<\/td><td>IMPACT<\/td><td><div>September 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. John Murphy <\/td><td>Secretary General, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<\/td><td><div>November 2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; <\/td><td>Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills<\/td><td><div>February 2012<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. John Moran<\/td><td>Secretary General, Department of Finance<\/td><td><div>March 2012<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900073#WRE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Losses","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900073#WRE01850"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[7883\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900073#WRE01900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide the number of jobs lost by sector; and the number of jobs created by sector for each region since 2007.","asker":"1080","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.

EDP returns are made to EUROSTAT twice a year, at the end of March and the end of October of a given year, in respect of the previous four years.  In March 2013, therefore, GG Debt will be reported for the years from 2009 to 2012, with the 2012 figure being a first estimate.  The Department of Finance will report forecast data for 2013 in this same return.  In addition to the EDP returns, the CSO also reports on GG Debt on a quarterly basis to EUROSTAT under the European System of Accounts (ESA95) transmission programme.  Therefore, the first time the CSO will report on GG Debt for 2013 will be at the end of June 2013, when the Quarterly Government Debt return (Table 2800 of ESA95 transmission programme) for the first quarter of 2013 will be made.  General Government Gross Debt (or Maastricht Debt) is defined as the sum of liabilities of the General Government sector in the categories of Currency &amp; Deposits (AF.2), securities other than shares, excluding derivatives (AF.33) and loans (AF.4).  With regard to the recent announcement in respect of the promissory notes, the immediate impact on the reporting of GG Debt for 2013 will be the reclassification of these particular debt instruments from the category of Long-Term Loans (AF.42) to Long-Term Securities (AF.332).  This reclassification will not impact on the overall GG Debt figure.  The CSO will also report on any changes in the GG Debt which may arise as a result in this change of debt instrument on a quarterly basis under the ESA95 transmission programme and for annual data in the EDP returns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900074#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Relations","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900074#WRF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[8629\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900074#WRF00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will confirm the discussions he had at the recent Davos summit with respect to investment in Myanmar, Burma; the persons with whom he had discussions; the nature of these discussions; if he has committed to deliver any assistance to any party in respect of communications investment in Myanmar.","asker":"959","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>The opening up of Myanmar and prospects for development and investment there is an important global theme, which arose in various discussions in Davos.

Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency agenda reflects very closely our domestic priorities.  The opening phase of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the EU is now over.  Our Presidency Programme &ldquo;for Stability, Jobs and Growth&rdquo; has been well received and work is now well under way to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s key Presidency priorities.  The Presidency has actively supported the President of the European Council in securing agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) which is essential to underpin Europe&rsquo;s economic recovery, future growth and social cohesion.  We are engaging intensively with the European Parliament in order to secure its formal assent to the MFF regulation and accompanying Inter-Institutional Agreement.  We will be chairing discussions on almost 70 separate sectoral regulations (including on Common Agricultural Policy reform) related to the MFF proposal and negotiating their passage through the Parliament. <\/p><p>  One of the most pressing problems in Europe today is high level of unemployment, in particular of young people.  Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency has placed the spotlight on youth unemployment and is taking the necessary measures to secure significant progress on related legislative dossiers such as the youth employment and social investment packages and the youth guarantee file.  We will be seeking to make good progress in this area at the Employment and Social Affairs Council at the end of February.  External trade is also a key driver for jobs and growth.  This is why Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency is focusing substantively on the EU external trade agenda, in particular EU-US relations and with the rapidly growing markets in Asia.  Recent statements by the President of the United States and by EU leaders have given us an additional impetus for working on a mandate necessary for launching negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States.<\/p><p>  Ireland is seeking to manage the effective implementation of economic governance measures that have been agreed at EU level, in particular the European Semester process of budgetary and economic co-ordination, and the Banking Union proposals.  In order to foster growth and boost job creation across the Union, Ireland is paying special attention to unlocking the potential of the European Single Market and, in particular, of the Digital Agenda.  The Presidency is working to advance proposals on intellectual property, cyber-security, e-Signatures\/e-Identification, Data Protection, web accessibility and high-speed broadband roll-out.

The Council yesterday adopted comprehensive conclusions which reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s support for international efforts to support stabilisation in Mali and to counter the threat of terrorism.  Recognising that the issues in Mali cannot be addressed by military means alone, Ministers emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and especially the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  In particular, EU Ministers have underlined the preparations for the free and fair elections that are scheduled to take place before the end of July, and the establishment of a National Commission for Dialogue and Reconciliation in Mali.  The Council stressed the importance of international co-ordination on Mali and welcomed the outcomes of the meeting of the Support and Follow-Up Group which took place in Brussels on 5 February, at which the Minister of State for Trade and Development represented Ireland as part of our Presidency of the EU.<\/p><p>  Following the discussion on the resumption of development assistance to Mali, which took place at the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin on 12 February, the Council welcomed the gradual resumption of EU development aid, within the framework of a &quot;State-Building Contract&quot;, linked to implementation of the transition roadmap.  I am particularly concerned at the impact of the crisis on the civilian population of Mali, which was addressed by the Council yesterday, with particular emphasis on the plight of refugees and displaced persons.  The Council also addressed reports of human rights violations in Mali.  The EU's commitment of support for the deployment of human rights monitors in the country is an important development.  In our discussions on Mali, the Council reviewed progress on the deployment of the EU Training Mission in Mali and reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s support for the efforts of the African Union and the regional authorities to put in place the African-led force, AFISMA.  We also discussed the broader regional dimensions of the crisis and underlined the importance of the EU&rsquo;s Sahel Strategy and the appointment of an EU Special Representative for the Sahel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900074#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[8196\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900074#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the recent Foreign Affairs EU Council extended the EU sanctions package against Syria beyond the end of March; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>Since the crisis first erupted almost two years ago, the EU has been prompt in adopting a wide range of restrictive measures targeted against the Assad regime and its supporters to compel them to stop their brutal crackdown and engage in an inclusive process of national dialogue aiming for transition and reform within Syria.

The Foreign Affairs Council at the end of November renewed the EU sanctions package for a period of three months, allowing a comprehensive review of all applicable sanctions and restrictive measures to take place before they expire at the end of February.  The Foreign Affairs Council on 18 February devoted considerable attention to reviewing the existing sanctions regime and assessing how to further apply pressure against the Syrian authorities given their continuous campaign of repression and violence.

I believe this conference - and, indeed, the discussion on this topic more generally - will help to highlight the calamitous, unmanageable and immoral implications of any use, whether accidental or deliberate, of nuclear weapons.  It will also help to demonstrate again that the possession of nuclear weapons entails unacceptable risks and that there is no place for these weapons in defensive arsenals or security postures.  The Deputy may be aware that there was discussion of the humanitarian dimension of nuclear disarmament at the 2010 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which expressed its &ldquo;deep concern at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons\" and reaffirmed \"the need for all States at all times to comply with applicable international law, including international humanitarian law\".<\/p><p>  When the preparatory process towards the next (2015) NPT Review Conference commenced in Vienna last May, Switzerland sought to generate discussion around this topic with a joint statement on the humanitarian dimension of nuclear disarmament, which it delivered on behalf of 16 states.  It delivered the same statement to the 67th UN General Assembly First Committee meeting in October on behalf of 34 states.  Ireland was involved with both statements from the outset and we are associated by name with them.  I can confirm to the Deputy that Ireland will participate actively in the Oslo Conference.   Last December I was invited by my Norwegian counterpart to nominate Irish representatives at senior official and expert level to participate in the conference.  The Director for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will attend on my behalf.  Our Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva, which covers disarmament issues, will also be represented.  We are consulting other interested Government Departments to establish how best we might frame a constructive contribution to the discussion in Oslo.  The conference will be preceded by a civil society meeting, organised by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which will debate the same topic.  A contingent of NGOs from the civil society meeting will then participate in the official conference.  I believe civil society has an extremely important role to play in raising awareness about this important issue and contributing to debate.  I hope Irish civil society will be able to feed into the useful and timely discussion that is emerging.  Ireland has an established track record of support for efforts to promote nuclear disarmament.

This aid is working. Since commencing our work in Uganda in 1994, we have witnessed huge improvements in the quality of life for the Ugandan people. Peace has returned to most of the country after generations of war.  There are now 8.3 million pupils in primary schools compared to 2.5 million 15 years ago. The HIV prevalence rate has been reduced dramatically from 18% in the 1990s to just over 6% today.  Poverty has more than halved over the last two decades. These are real achievements, which have been made possible with the support of donors such as Ireland.    Following the fraud at the Office of the Prime Minister in 2012 which involved the loss of &euro;4 million in Irish Aid funds, the Government suspended all aid provided directly through Ugandan Government systems amounting to &euro;16 million. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government of Uganda has since refunded the &euro;4 million to Ireland.  Ireland has made it clear to the Ugandan Authorities that no Irish Aid support will be channelled directly through Government systems until there has been sufficient follow up to the fraud and until we are satisfied with appropriate assurances from the Ugandan Government around its internal financial systems. We will continue to work with other development partners and directly with the Ugandan Government to assess progress in this regard. <\/p><p>  An interim development cooperation programme for Uganda in 2013 is under consideration. This will be a smaller programme compared to recent years involving support to programmes managed through non-government partners.  Most of these are a continuation of existing programmes and commitments in education, HIV\/AIDS, governance and social protection.  Consideration is also being given to providing direct support to important oversight institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General. Over the course of this year, options will be considered for a longer term strategic approach to the development cooperation programme in Uganda.<\/p><p>  The Syrian conflict is now almost two years old. In excess of 60,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which has seen the indiscriminate targeting of civilians and residential areas, as well as humanitarian and medical actors. With more than 820,000 individuals having fled the desperate situation in the country, the majority of whom are women and children, neighbouring countries have shown great generosity but also endured great strain in hosting those in need. Ireland has responded promptly and generously, both within Syria and in the neighbouring countries most affected by the humanitarian crisis.<\/p><p>  As early as March 2012, the Government began providing emergency assistance through partner agencies on the ground, and to date, our total contribution stands at &euro;7.1 million. This includes the recent pledge of &euro;4.7 million made at the High Level Donor Pledging Conference for Syria in Kuwait City on 30 January 2013 attended by Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello, T.D. Delivered through key UN partners, trusted NGOs and the International Committee of the Red Cross, this support is helping to address the pressing medical and food needs of those requiring life-saving assistance. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution also includes supplies of non-food items from our stocks in Dubai through our Rapid Response Initiative. Into the future we will continue to monitor the situation so that we can review the effectiveness of our contribution and assess how, within our means, we may be able to further respond to humanitarian needs within the region. <\/p><p>  Holding the Presidency of the European Council, Ireland is striving to build momentum behind international efforts to ease the terrible humanitarian burden faced by the Syrian people, emphasising the need for all parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian access and aid delivery to the people in need, to ensure the neutrality of humanitarian aid and to abide by International Humanitarian Law. Ireland is using the EU Presidency to call on all donors to fulfil pledges made, in coordination with the UN and in full respect of humanitarian principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900075#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900075#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[8289\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900075#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the reinstatement of Villa Spada as Ireland's Vatican Embassy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>As I have stated consistently, the decision to close the resident Embassy to the Holy See will not be reversed in the immediate term.

Michel Martelly. They discussed the challenges facing Haiti, with a particular focus on the provision of durable housing for the Internally Displaced population. The T&aacute;naiste was briefed by President Martelly on progress to date, as well as on the Haitian Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to providing those who are still in camps with appropriate housing solutions. <\/p><p>  The Haiti Humanitarian Action Plan identifies shelter as a top priority requiring assistance of $46 million. Since the earthquake in Haiti over three years ago, Ireland&rsquo;s response to the humanitarian needs has been significant and sustained. In 2010 Ireland pledged funding of &euro;13m for Haiti for the period 2010-2012. This pledge has now been exceeded, and to date, &euro;13.9 million in funding has been disbursed. This funding has focused on the most vulnerable and the most pressing needs, including emergency shelter and reconstruction. The T&aacute;naiste availed of the opportunity of his recent meeting with President Martelly to assure him that Haiti remains a priority for Ireland in terms of humanitarian engagement. It is anticipated that Ireland will provide additional funding to Haiti in 2013 in order to continue our support for the rehabilitation and reconstruction process.<\/p><p>  The reconstruction and provision of institutional support for Haiti is also a priority for the European Union which to date has provided &euro;213 million in humanitarian assistance to the country, including an additional &euro;  30.5 million allocated in January to help those still homeless as a result of the earthquake, cholera victims and those badly affected by Hurricane Sandy.

This can severely limit the operations and effectiveness of organisations, notably those working on human rights and advocacy.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a long tradition of supporting civil society engagement.  Through the Government&#8217;s aid programme, we work to protect the space in which civil society organisations operate, and to foster an enabling environment for the work.  We channel a higher proportion of our development assistance through civil society organisations than other international donors.  Of Ireland&#8217;s total aid budget of &#8364;623 million this year, about a quarter will be channelled through civil society organisations to support their valuable work in, for example, improving access to health care and education, supporting livelihoods, and strengthening accountability, governance and democracy.  Tr&oacute;caire and a number of other organisations, such as, Christian Aid and Frontline Defenders, is specifically funded by my Department to promote and facilitate strong civil society engagement across a range of countries.<\/p><p><br \/>  In Ireland&#8217;s nine partner countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, we also provide funding to local civil society organisations.  This enables their participation at local and national levels of decision-making and their work for the fulfilment of human rights, especially for the most vulnerable.  Ireland&#8217;s partnerships in these countries are founded on respect for human rights, and we will continue to emphasise in our dialogue with partner governments that it is essential to ensure the role of civil society organisations is enhanced.<\/p><p><br \/>  Internationally, we have agreed, by signing up to the 2011 Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, to implement fully our commitments to enable civil society organisations to exercise their role as independent development actors.  At the meeting of Development Ministers under the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Luxembourg in October last, I gave strong support to new Conclusions on Europe's engagement with civil society.  These commit Member States &#8220;to support and promote an enabling environment for an independent, pluralistic and active civil society in partner countries&#8221;<i>.  <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The EU will work to improve our dialogue with civil society organisations on the ground, and to continue close monitoring of legislation, regulations and other restrictions on the operation of civil society organisations in our partner countries.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland&#8217;s membership of the UN Human Rights Council presents a valuable opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society.  We intend to advance this issue during our term on the Council, building on a successful meeting on consolidating the space for civil society which Ireland organised during the September 2012 Human Rights Council session.  Ireland is also championing the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism which reviews all member states&#8217; human rights records, including the treatment of civil society actors and human rights defenders.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government will continue to promote civil society-led initiatives and to support other arrangements at national and international level to promote and monitor an enabling environment for civil society organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900075#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900075#WRG01850"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[8797\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900075#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will consider issuing a new passport to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 18; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>The Passport Service has no record of a new application on behalf of the persons named.

The Commissioners' &quot;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&quot;, which is published on the Revenue website (<i>www.revenue.ie<\/i>), includes a wide range of measures designed to target those engaged in the supply and sale of illicit tobacco products and very significant resources will be devoted to this issue in 2013.  This multi-faceted strategy includes:<\/p><p>- the ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem,<\/p><p>- developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis,<\/p><p>- the ongoing review of operational policies by a high-level group within Revenue that is chaired by one of the Commissioners personally,<\/p><p>- the development of analytics and detection technologies, and<\/p><p>- the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.<\/p><p>As regards Dublin city centre, Revenue actively monitors the illegal tobacco trade and has identified certain areas as particular black spots for the sale of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue is currently engaged in an ongoing range of measures targeting those involved.  Officers routinely conduct high visibility patrols aimed at disrupting the sale and supply of tobacco products in areas in question.<i> <\/i> In November 2012, Revenue increased the number of patrols in the areas concerned.  Revenue's presence in these areas has also been bolstered by the deployment of both the tobacco dog unit and marked vehicles during certain targeted operations.  In 2012, 5 cases were referred for prosecution in relation to illegal trading in tobacco products in the city centre.  Revenue expects a number of further prosecutions for such cases to come before the courts in 2013.  Moreover, in tandem with ongoing high visibility patrols of the area, Revenue personnel are actively engaged in covert surveillance and test purchasing for the purpose of gathering intelligence with a view to identifying and prosecuting the suppliers of illicit tobacco products in the areas concerned.<\/p><p>At a national level, interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally.  There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The relevant agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organized crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.<\/p><p>Considerable success has been achieved by Revenue in combating the illegal trade.  Details of the quantities of cigarettes seized each year since 2005 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Quantity of cigarettes seized (millions)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>51.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>52.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>74.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>135.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>218.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>178.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>109.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>95.6<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures.  For example, the quantity of cigarettes seized in 2009 includes one exceptional seizure of some 120 million cigarettes that were uncovered on a vessel at Greenore, Co. Louth.<\/p><p>Moreover, the Revenue Commissioners have had considerable success in detecting and prosecuting persons involved in the illicit trade.  For example, in 2012, there were 57 convictions for tobacco smuggling, resulting in 26 custodial sentences being handed down by the Courts (of which 7 were suspended) as well as fines totalling &euro;93,550.  In addition, there were a further 75 convictions connected with the sale or keeping for sale of unstamped tobacco products, resulting in 21 custodial sentences (14 of which were suspended) as well as fines of &euro;153,050.<\/p><p>Revenue is committed to ensuring that the highest possible levels of seizures of illicit products are achieved on an ongoing basis, and that those responsible for the smuggling, supply or selling of illicit products are prosecuted, and will ensure that this work continues to have the high priority that has been accorded to it to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900076#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900076#WRH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[8361\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900076#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify the situation regarding senior citizens complexes in Dublin City Council and the proposed property tax; and if the council pays this property tax.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the Local Property Tax (LPT) on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties are used to accommodate people with special housing needs, such as the elderly and people with disabilities.  \"Special housing needs\" refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  In relation to senior citizens' complexes, a local authority would qualify for an exemption from LPT, if it was providing some necessary support to these senior citizens in addition to the housing accommodation.

Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks have achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. <\/p><p>  The pillar banks are expected to lend to viable businesses in all sectors of the economy, including the hotel sector, and to address the needs of SMEs in financial difficulty.

However, in  his most recent quarterly report, the Credit Reviewer stated that <\/p><p>  &quot;I have observed no geographic region or trade sector being relatively adversely affected by this contraction in these two banks.

This Committee is chaired by An Taoiseach and includes all other relevant Ministers, and reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area.  At official level, my Department is taking a lead role and in that context, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department's Secretary General, was established to drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (the 'Keane Report').  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Personal Insolvency Act is now in place and considerable work is now underway to shortly launch the Insolvency Service and to bring into operation the new insolvency frameworks provided for in that Act.

The focus of this work is now intensifying and will be on the implementation of these strategies, in particular on the delivery of durable restructuring arrangement to appropriate borrowers, and ensuring that banks have the operational capability to implement them effectively.  The Deputy may also be aware of Governor Honohan's recent comments at the Central Bank&rsquo;s Conference on 'How to Fix Distressed Property Markets' in which he said that the banks are much better staffed and organised for dealing with arrears, and that the Central Bank will be setting out its quantitative expectations for their effectiveness in achieving lasting solutions.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) remains a key framework to govern the relationship between mortgage holders experiencing difficulty and their bank.

As such a debtor will be in a position to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement to address unsustainable mortgage debt, irrespective of the particular type of mortgage.  However, strict eligibility criteria will apply before a debtor can make such a proposal to his\/her creditors, including that the debtor is regarded as being insolvent.

This was announced in the Jobs Initiative on 10 May 2011.  In reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, the introduction of the 9% VAT rate is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.

The scheme provides for expenditure on R&amp;D that is in excess of that undertaken in the base year of 2003 to qualify for the credit.

Finance Bill 2013 also contains a small number of measures to improve the competitiveness of the IFSC and assist in maintaining and growing employment in the sector.<\/p><p><i>Renewable energy generation<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Finance Act 2012  extended the qualifying period for the scheme of tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects from 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2014.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage investment in renewable energy projects and to facilitate the growth of electricity generation capacity using these sources.  It applies to the following categories of technology: Solar, Wind, Hydro (including ocean, wave or tidal energy), and Biomass.<\/p><p><i>Energy-efficient equipment<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Finance Bill 2012  also extended the scheme of accelerated capital allowances for expenditure by companies on certain energy-efficient equipment for a further 3 years to end-2014.<\/p><p><i>Cut in commercial Stamp Duty<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Finance Bill 2012  abolished multiple Stamp Duty rates for non-residential properties, and brought in a single rate of 2% in respect of instruments executed after 6 December 2011.  <\/p><p><i>Real Estate Investment Trusts <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  As announced in the Budget, Finance Bill 2013 will provide a new tax regime to allow for the introduction of <b>Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)<\/b>   companies in Ireland.  REITs are an internationally recognised format for collective investment in rental property.  It is hoped that REITs will facilitate the attraction of foreign investment capital to the Irish property market, helping to stabilise that market, and also releasing bank financing from the property market for use by other sectors of the economy.

As shareholders, the Member States are represented on the Bank's main independent decision-making bodies, the Board of Governors and the Board of Directors. The overall objective of the Bank is to contribute towards the integration, balanced development and economic and social cohesion of the EU Member States.    <\/p><p>  The EIB has four statutory bodies; three decision making bodies: the Board of Governors, the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, and one control body: the Audit Committee. <\/p><p>  The Board of Governors comprises Ministers designated by each of the 27 Member States, usually Finance Ministers. It lays down credit policy guidelines, approves the annual accounts and balance sheet, and decides on the Bank&rsquo;s participation in financing operations outside the European Union as well as on capital increases. It also appoints the members of the Board of Directors, the Management Committee and the Audit Committee. I am currently Ireland&rsquo;s representative on the Board of Governors. <\/p><p>  The Board of Directors consists of 28 Directors, with one Director nominated by each Member State and one by the European Commission.

As well as seeing that the Bank is properly run, it ensures that the Bank is managed in keeping with the provisions of the Treaty and the Statute and with the general directives laid down by the Governors.

The relevant provision of the Ireland &#8211; Zambia Convention is Article XXI. While the Irish Revenue Commissioners cannot comment in relation to any specific case, they have informed me that the Zambian tax authorities have not expressed any concerns in relation to the application or interpretation of the Convention.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Ireland - Zambia Convention sets out the &#8220;arm&#8217;s length principle&#8221;, which requires profits arising between connected parties, i.e. which involve the uses of transfer prices, to be computed in the same amount as would arise on foot of transactions between independent parties. This principle has continued to be an unchanging feature of the OECD and UN Model Double Taxation Conventions  .  It is not apparent, therefore, that there is any basis for linking concerns in relation to transfer pricing with the provisions of this Convention.<\/p><p><br \/>  Specific transfer pricing legislation was enacted by Finance Act, 2010 and is contained in Part 35A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  These provisions set out the rules that govern the application of the arm's length principle, mentioned above.  The arm&#8217;s length principle and the related transfer pricing provisions must be applied to adjust any understatement of profit that would otherwise arise, so that the full arm&#8217;s length profit is taxed in Ireland.  Companies within the scope of the Part 35A provisions must meet documentation requirements and have such documentation available to Revenue to demonstrate compliance with the legislation.  The first corporation tax returns to which the legislation applied were for accounting periods ending on 31 December 2011 and these returns were received in September 2012. <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the provisions mentioned above, the provisions of Chapter 3 of Part 33 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 set out requirements to provide the Revenue Commissioners with information in respect of <i>disclosable transactions. <\/i>These are<i><\/i>  specified types of transactions one of the main purposes of which would be to provide a tax advantage. As with the tax codes of other countries, where anti-avoidance and disclosure provisions are intended to protect the domestic tax base, the provisions of Part 35A and Chapter 3 of Part 33 are intended to protect the Irish tax base. <\/p><p><br \/>  Assistance to other countries in addressing suspected avoidance or evasion is provided internationally by exchange of information.  All of Ireland&#8217;s double taxation agreements &#8211; including that with Zambia &#8211; contain provisions for the exchange, between the tax authorities, of information necessary to give effect to the agreement and to the domestic tax law of the Contracting States.  Ireland has also negotiated over 20 Tax Information Exchange Agreements &#8211; implementing the OECD standard on exchange of information - with countries with which we do not have a double taxation agreement. <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, Ireland has signed up to the joint Council of Europe\/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.  In response to a call from the G20 in 2009 &#8220;to make it easier for developing countries to secure the benefits of the new co-operative tax environment&#8221;, a Protocol was developed to amend this Convention to open it up to all countries.  Ireland signed the Convention and the Protocol in June 2011.

A key element of the restructuring of the Promissory Notes was the liquidation of IBRC. The disappearance of the former Anglo Irish Bank and former Irish Nationwide Building Society from our financial, political and social landscape was long overdue. They became emblems of a culture of cronyism that undermined the confidence in both our economy and our political system.  They became a stain on our international reputation and dent to our national pride.  There are numerous benefits from the arrangement that have been undertaken.  There are efficiency gains from housing &lsquo;legacy assets&rsquo; in a single vehicle, NAMA.  Exceptional Liquidity Assistance and the inherent risk associated with short term borrowings has also been removed from the Irish banking landscape.  There is also an expected reduction in the underlying deficit by c.&euro;1 billion per annum over the coming years with a reduction in government debt over time.<\/p><p>  The Special Liquidation Order, made under the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013, is no different from other liquidations and for employees in IBRC their employment was terminated with immediate effect following the passing of the Act on Thursday 7th February.  There is no doubt that this will have come as a shock to the employees in the bank.  It is unfortunate that it was not possible to give more notice on this matter and I regret the abruptness of how this decision was communicated to the management and staff.  However it was imperative to keep the matter confidential due to the scale, sensitivity and complexity of the economic issues involved.  As previously stated I want to acknowledge, with much appreciation, the significant efforts the directors and staff of IBRC have made to the stabilisation of, and maintenance of value in, IBRC.  Nonetheless, unlike in other liquidations many of the employees have been be re-hired by the Special Liquidator, some of whom will be employed for the duration of the liquidation on such terms as he may determine.<\/p><p>  The Special Liquidators have confirmed to IBRC staff that there will be no termination of contracts within the first 3 months of the liquidation.

It is too early in the process to speculate on the potential financial outcome of the liquidation process, however I can confirm that due consideration was given, in preparatory work on the liquidation of IBRC and the legislation passed earlier this month, to ensuring the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer.  As part of the role of the liquidators, the assets of IBRC will be valued independently before being sold.  Any assets not sold to third parties (including loan counterparties and other financial institutions) at or above the valuation price will be sold to NAMA at the independent valuation.  This ensures a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; price on the assets of IBRC and that where required, assets with limited sale potential can be worked through in the medium term by NAMA rather than sold at any price.

A response is then prepared and issued.  The Revenue Commissioners are very mindful of the unfair competitive advantage to be gained by those businesses that do not fulfil their tax obligations.  Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme that is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects.  A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as prearranged aspect queries on specific items.  In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units and there is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature.<\/p><p>  In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, yielding more than &euro;492 million.  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade in tobacco products.  In 2012, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 95.6 million cigarettes from 8,108 seizures.  A further 5,276 kilograms of other tobacco products were taken in 2012 from 1,395 seizures.  There were 22 convictions on indictment, and 110 summary convictions, during the year for offences related to the smuggling or sale of illicit cigarettes and tobacco.<\/p><p>  In addition to the on-going enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced control and supervision at all stages of the fuel supply chain. Key actions include a strengthening of the licensing arrangements for businesses selling auto-fuel, and of the enforcement of licensing requirements.  In addition, new licensing requirements have been applied to persons dealing in marked fuels, with effect from 1 October 2012.  As well as these important licensing changes, a requirement operates from 1 January 2013 for all fuel traders to make electronic monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel transactions.  This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.<\/p><p>  Given the links of organised criminality with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it.  Searches undertaken as part of intelligence-led operations have resulted in a considerable number of seizures of diesel and the closure of laundering plants, particularly in border counties.  In 2012, 11 oil laundries were detected and shut down and 199,000 litres of oil were seized along with 27 vehicles, 2 fork-lifts and 5 trailers.  There were 10 arrests in the course of these operations.  57 premises were closed in 2012.  In addition to the fuel seized at laundries, a further 902,087 litre of fuel were seized during the year, the greater part from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to them.<\/p><p>  Much of the focus of the Joint Investigation Units (JIUs) is on shadow economy activity and their operations include targeting illegal traders at markets and at seasonal events (Christmas fairs, outdoor concerts etc.).  During 2012, over 3,000 outdoor checks\/visits\/inspections were carried out by the JIU teams including 168 multi-agency operations.  The Revenue Commissioners hold regular meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow economy activities are discussed. The most recent meeting took place on January 30th.<\/p><p>  Changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity.  Two examples from 2012 include the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully.  If any members of a Council wish to bring specific information on shadow economy activity to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, they may contact Planning Division, Bishop&rsquo;s Square, Redmond&rsquo;s Hill, Dublin 2, or at the direct line (01) 4244276.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900078#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Ombudsman","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900078#WRK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[8799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900078#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of levies paid by each credit institution to the Financial Services Ombudsman in 2010, 2011 and 2012","asker":"1090","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>The method of calculating the levies which regulated financial services institutions provide  to the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman to carry out its duties are set out in Statutory Instrument Number 506 of 2012.

The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07\/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.<\/p><p><br \/>  SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles.  The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his\/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need. In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and\/or resource teacher.  SNAs are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme. This review is available on my Departments website: www.education.gov.ie.  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  However, the review also found that the allocation process is generally not well understood within schools and by parents nor is the purpose of the Scheme fully understood.  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals. However, the review did not recommend expanding the role of the SNA.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has established a working group which is presently implementing the recommendations of the SNA Value for Money report.  I can also advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 to advise me as Minister in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  The NCSE have been asked to provide comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs.  This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan.  I can advise that this advice will consider:<blockquote>- the identification and assessment of children with special needs<br \/><br \/>- the nature of supports provided for children- the way in which supports are allocated to schools and<br \/><br \/>- how these supports are configured.<\/blockquote>The advice from the NCSE is expected in the coming months.  It is my intention that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students.  The advice will be a key input into achieving this goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900078#WRK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900079#WRL00050"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[8074\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900079#WRL00100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the process that applies to student grant applications in the event of a separation maintenance agreement being in place (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of the full details that would be contained in an individual application form, it is not possible for me to say whether or not the payment in question should be included as reckonable income for the students in question.

The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;.  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that there will be a smaller number of centres for ITE offering education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or through a combination of these. Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.  However my officials are currently compiling a document to bring together and further clarify the various strands of policy in this area.<\/p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.<\/p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.<\/p><p>  In arriving at the preferred policy which is currently in place, my Department has considered published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001) and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), both of which are available on my Department's website and have also informed the policy. My Department was also mindful of contributions of many other experts at international conferences\/visits have also informed the development views.  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900080#WRM03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Application Numbers","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900080#WRM03350"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[8744\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900080#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students from farming backgrounds currently in receipt of a student grant, broken down on a county basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>The table contains the available information in the Department in this matter.

The new Framework for Junior Cycle which I published last October will, inter alia, aim to increase the importance of physical wellbeing in several ways:<\/p><p> - The Framework is based on eight Principles. The Principle of &quot;Wellbeing&quot; undertakes to ensure that &quot;the student experience contributes directly to their physical wellbeing.&quot;<\/p><p> - In addition, eight Key Skills are required for successful learning across the curriculum and beyond the school. This is in recognition of the fact that learning takes place both inside and outside of the formal school environment. One of these Key Skills is &quot;Staying Well&quot;, which adopts a holistic approach to wellbeing and includes &quot;Being healthy, physical and active&quot;.<\/p><p> - Contained in the Junior Cycle's Statements of Learning is the stated aim that the student is &quot;confident and competent in physical activity and is motivated to be physically active&quot;, and that he\/she &quot;understands the importance of food and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices&quot;.<\/p><p> - Perhaps most importantly in this respect, the new junior cycle will enable schools to offer Physical Education as a short course, which means that, for the first time, it can be certified.<\/p><p>  The Active School Flag, funded by my Department, was officially launched in 2009 to motivate and award schools which strive to achieve a physically active and physically educated school community.  The funding provided to the ASF was &euro;116,000 per year for the past 3 years, and &euro;80,000 in 2012. Since September 2009, just over 1000 primary schools and 128 post-primary schools have registered for the programme. Some 180 schools have already been awarded their flags.  The ASF rewards schools in their efforts in this area and the Department sees it as its initiative to enhance a student's healthy lifestyle.  More schools are registering to participate each year.<\/p><p>  In 2009 my Department carried out a Lifeskills Survey in primary and post primary schools. They found that in addition to formal PE provision that some 90% of schools encourage not only  physical activity and regular exercise during school breaks but they also encourage the young people to participate in sport outside school time. The work in the school has to be complimented and reinforced by the families and the communities of our young people if the spread of childhood obesity is to be reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900080#WRM04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900080#WRM04250"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[8764\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900080#WRM04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will clarify the pay scale and allowances in respect of a teacher (details supplied) in County Offaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1055","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>The pay scale and allowances of the person referred to by the Deputy are being checked at present.

Following the evaluation of these schemes, rain water harvesting systemifs were introduced for major school building projects in 2008.  Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their brief.<\/p><p>  While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making good work that is required in each instance.<\/p><p>  For existing buildings it is more cost effective to minimise the demand for water firstly through installing measures to reduce water usage such as push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc.  To this end, as part of the Summer Works Scheme 2010, schools were invited to apply for Water Conservation measures.

This work is supported by professional development for teachers, by digital content on the Scoilnet website, and by investment in ICT infrastructure in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900081#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900081#WRN01650"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[8882\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900081#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive a decision on their application to Student Universal Support Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland that it is awaiting the final course acceptance form from the student in question to enable his grant application to be processed to finality.

The Bill proceeded through its second stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October 2012. I wish to advise the Deputy that officials in my Department are currently engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and other interested parties and I will be considering potential amendments which may be introduced at Committee Stage in the very near future. However, it is not possible for me to advise the Deputy as to the likely date for enactment of the Bill, as this depends on a number of factors which are outside my control, including the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.<\/p><p><br \/>  At the outset, let me say that the Bill will not change the basis of valuation for rating purposes. This will continue to be &#8220;net annual value&#8221; which is the hypothetical rental value of a property as assessed by reference to a specified date. This is a long standing principle of the rateable valuation system in Ireland and ensures equity and fairness in relation to the values of commercial and industrial properties across a local authority area.<\/p><p><br \/>  The primary purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the national programme of revaluing every commercial and industrial property in the country which is being undertaken by the Valuation Office. The Bill amends several provisions contained in the Valuation Act 2001. These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act which deals with how valuations, including revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out. The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6, which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas between revaluations. In both instances, it is envisaged that the Commissioner of Valuation will appoint officers to carry out the tasks in question and the Bill makes specific provision for the appointment of &#8220;revision managers&#8221;. Section 6 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 19 of the Valuation Act 2001 by enabling the Commissioner to appoint persons to carry out the revaluation of entire rating authority areas. Such persons may be an officer of the Commissioner. However, provision is also made for the Commissioner to enter into an arrangement with a person or persons (other than officers of the Commissioner) to assist in the performance of the revaluation function. The effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that revaluation projects can be conducted through the normal <i>direct assessment<\/i> methodology.  However, the Bill (Section 11, inserting a new Part 5A into the 2001 Act) also provides for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation using elements of <i>self-assessment<\/i> by ratepayers. This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise self-assessment principles. Finally, I wish to draw the Deputy&#8217;s attention to Section 22 of the Bill which proposes to amend Section 48 of the 2001 Act by providing for the use of general market data or aggregated data (including <i>statistical and computer-aided techniques<\/i>  ) in determining valuations, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900081#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900081#WRN02450"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[8623\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900081#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on the progress made to date in relation to dealing with flooding problems on the properties of a number of householders and farmers in the Clondra area, County Longford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>There is on-going progress in respect of the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp; Management Study which will provide a comprehensive review of flooding problems within the River Shannon catchment.

Against this background, proportionate reductions to existing public service pensions have been given effect through legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The current situation regarding public service pensions is as follows:<\/p><p>- Public service pensioners (including retired politicians) in Ireland have had their pensions cut. <\/p><p>- The <i>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010<\/i>   provided for the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR). The PSPR, commencing 1 January 2011, imposed significant reductions on public service pensions in payment, using a progressively tiered set of bands and rates with a top rate of 12% on any public service pension amount over &#8364;60,000. <\/p><p>- I have,  acting on foot of my concern about large public service pensions, amended the legislation to increase the top rate of PSPR to 20% on any public service pension amount over &#8364;100,000 (aside from other taxes and deductions). Initially the PSPR was imposed separately on each public service pension.  However, following an amendment introduced in the <i>Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012<\/i>, the PSPR will be imposed on the aggregated value of <b>all<\/b>   public service pensions held by a person who has more than one such pension.<\/p><p>- Public service pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation, including those made by this Government, have impacted progressively so that higher earners have taken the hardest hit.  These pay cuts have been fully reflected in the pensions of persons who retired from 1 March 2012 onward.  The average pay cut imposed has been around 7%, but this extends to more than 20% for the highest earners, of whom senior officer holders are clearly one part. <\/p><p>- The new Single Public Service Pension Scheme will deliver pensions to future public servants on the basis of career-average earnings rather than final salary; this will impose (by comparison with pre-Single Scheme &quot;final salary&quot; norms) a particularly significant moderation in the level of pension awarded to higher paid public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900082#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900082#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[8803\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900082#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the envisaged impact of the public procurement process on the school supply sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>The purpose of this Circular is to inform public bodies of the mandatory requirement to utilise central contracts, put in place by the NPS, when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services. Such central arrangements are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.<\/p><p>  The NPS is focused on developing centralised arrangements for the procurement of goods and services used commonly across the public service nationwide. The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and compliance with EU procurement regulations; and enhanced service levels. Surveys carried out into public bodies, which switched from using their own contracts to the NPS contracts, have indicated that savings of up to 50% can be achieved.<\/p><p>  Prior to issuing tenders the NPS engages with its clients to ensure their requirements are met and that the most commonly bought items are included in the tender. Under the provision of Circular 06\/12 it is however permissible for buyers to purchase goods and services from non-NPS suppliers if these goods and services are demonstrably cheaper.<\/p><p>  However, where a public service body purchases such goods or services it will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangements and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process. <\/p><p>  Systems of internal control within public service bodies are to support compliance with the requirements of the circular. Public service bodies shall make available for review if requested by internal auditors, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Local Government Audit Service or other duly appointed auditors, details of internal controls in place to ensure compliance, and details of goods and services, subject to the mandate, acquired other than under mandated NPS central frameworks and the associated value for money justification.<\/p><p>  The NPS also has, as part of its education and development remit, an active programme to educate SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,500 SMEs nationwide. <\/p><p>  In NPS competitions, the tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs. A prime example of this is when the NPS decided to divide the office supplies contract into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. This was to increase the possibility for SMEs to tender individually, or form consortia that could enter competitive bids to win this national contract. <\/p><p>  Codex Ltd, an indigenous company, won the Stationery contract and are sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers.

IDA&rsquo;s client base now employs 152,785 people, a level last recorded before the global financial crisis began in 2008. 2012 saw the creation of 3,338 net new jobs in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI), the highest net new jobs figure since 2006. The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) created 417 net new jobs in 2012.<\/p><p>  The Government published on 1 February 2013, the fourth and final quarterly progress report under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012.

Since April 2012 those in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment are not entitled to household benefits in their own right.  For those who do reside with the person being cared for, the person is likely to already have an entitlement of their own to household benefits.  Approximately 31,000 carers receive a household benefits package.<\/p><p>  My Department provides a number of supports to carers. The two main weekly income support payments are the means tested carer&rsquo;s allowance (including half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance) and the PRSI based carer&rsquo;s benefit. In addition to either of these payments, non-resident carers continue to be entitled to the annual respite care grant and free travel.<\/p><p>  In general, to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit, the carer must live with the person being cared for. However, where the carer is not resident with the person they are caring for, the circumstances may still be suitable to allow them to provide full time care and attention.  In these cases, there must be a system of communication between the carer&rsquo;s residence and that of the care recipient such as telephone or an alarm type system. The care recipient must not already be receiving full time care and attention within his or her own residence from another person. <\/p><p>  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant; and &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance. <\/p><p>  There are over 52,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Of these, over 23,000 are getting half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment. There are approximately 1,700 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  <\/p><p>  The income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system.

These administrative arrangements were initially introduced to encourage persons to take up employment as a home help at a time when the remuneration from such employment was low.  This is no longer the case as the status and salary levels were formalised in 2000.  As the salary scale is now well ahead of the national minimum wage, there was no longer a basis for this special treatment.  The change advanced the objective of treating all income in the same way for means testing purposes with no special arrangements depending on the type of employment.<\/p><p>  Since January 2012, persons working as a home help benefit from the standard earnings disregards and tapering arrangements which apply to the assessment of earnings.  These vary across schemes and the current arrangements are now outlined in the case of one parent family payment, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance: <\/p><p>-\t  One-parent family payment: the first &euro;110 is disregarded in full and amounts between &euro;110 and &euro;425 are assessed at 50%.<\/p><p>-\t  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance: the first &euro;20 per day, subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week, is disregarded in full and 60% of the balance assessed.  <\/p><p>-\t  Disability allowance: the first &euro;120 per week of earnings from a rehabilitative nature is disregarded, any balance between &euro;120 per week and &euro;350 per week is assessed at 50% and any remaining balance is assessed in full.<\/p><p>  Where the spouse\/partner of a jobseeker&rsquo;s or disability allowance recipient is in employment the first &euro;20 per day of his or her earnings, subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week, is disregarded in full and 60% of the balance assessed.  <\/p><p>  The arrangements which applied in relation to the assessment of home help earnings prior to January 2012 varied across schemes.  For example, the treatment of the earnings of a qualified adult as a home help varied in the case of disability allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance; it was disregarded in full in the case of disability allowance and assessed in the same way as all other earnings in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.<\/p><p>  Disability allowance was introduced in 1996 and replaced the Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance (DPMA) which had been administered by the Health Boards.

As advised by my colleague, Richard Bruton, T.D., Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in response to Parliamentary Question 6485\/13, the National Employments Rights Authority (NERA) investigates complaints in relation to breaches of employment law.  Any complaints received by NERA in relation to au pairs would first be examined using the &ldquo;Code of Practice for Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&rdquo; in order to determine whether or not the person is in fact an employee.<\/p><p>  If the person is determined to be an employee, they enjoy the full protection of Irish Employment Law and the NERA inspection and enforcement procedures operate in the normal way.  A Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes (S.I. No. 239 of 2007) is in place and can be accessed on NERA&rsquo;s website.  Where people have concerns that employees may be exploited, or may be receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.<\/p><p>  Section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a legal contract of employment that provides for him or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a legal contract of employment.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under such a contract of employment in another person&rsquo;s home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under law as all other employees.<\/p><p>  Employments in the State under a contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, may be insurable for social insurance purposes.  A person aged over 16 years and under pensionable age (currently 66 years) may be regarded as an employed contributor for social insurance purposes and, subject to payment of the appropriate PRSI contributions and satisfying the other qualifying conditions, may qualify for the full range of long and short- term social insurance benefits.  For Class A employees, PRSI at the rate of 4% is payable based on their weekly earnings.  In addition, employers are required to pay PRSI at the rate of 10.75% in respect of their employees.<\/p><p>  In addition, as Minister Burton advised, the Department of Justice and Equality operates the student visa scheme and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have responsibility for childcare matters.

SPT will cease to be paid from 2014 which will standardise the payment of pension at age 66.  In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2012 and to 68 years from 2028.<\/p><p>  In December 2012, there were just under 14,400 SPT recipients compared to 312,300 recipients of SPC.  Only 1,700 people, or 12% in all, were awarded SPT directly from employment while almost half were already in receipt of another social welfare payment.<\/p><p>  A person who retires from work on reaching age 65 and who does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for SPT may apply for  another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.<\/p><p>  The abolition of SPT in 2014 removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.   The continued participation of older people in the labour market must be encouraged and facilitated to meet the challenge of an ageing society.  Employees and employers need to be persuaded to change their attitudes to working longer.  In the workplace, employers should try to retain older employees and create working conditions which make working longer both attractive and possible for the older worker.  At present, my Department is working with other Departments and relevant State agencies who have a role to play in identifying and breaking down barriers to remaining in work past the age of 65.<\/p><p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. Raising State pension age and the abolition of SPT is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future and to address the challenges of changing demographics such as increasing life expectancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900085#WRRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":915,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900085#WRRR02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":914,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900085#WRRR02400"},{"type":"question","counter":915,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[9241\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900085#WRRR02500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he intends to continue considering a consent application made under a planning application that has been amended and altered and is, by the applicant's own admission, now subject to further planning approval.","asker":"1005","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":916,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[8641\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900085#WRRR02525","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"in view of the fact that he has undertaken to preserve the national monument  Moore St, Dublin, under preservation order No.1 of 2007, if he will explain the basis upon which he can consider an application that seeks his consent to retain only the monument's buildings, that is, 40% of its protected area; the basis upon which the application, in seeking Ministerial consent, can simply ignore the protection afforded to the national monument as a protected structure and a national monument, by redrawing its boundary to facilitate the demolition of protected structures and outbuildings directly linked to the 1916 Rising and build on, over and under it.","asker":"1005","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":917,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 and 457 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are the subject of a Preservation Order under the National Monuments Acts.

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.<\/p><p>  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000 MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.

Network costs are reviewed every five years and used to establish maximum allowed revenues for BG&Eacute;'s transmission and distribution activities for a given year of the five-year period.  The allowed revenues are used to determine the network tariff for each year.  In August 2012, the CER published a Decision Paper on gas transmission revenue and tariffs for the period October 2012 to September 2013.  This Decision has resulted in increases in the transmission tariff paid by shippers.  These increases were based on the forecast bookings for capacity submitted in April 2012 by Bord G&aacute;is Networks (BGN), based on demand estimates.  Since then there has been a persistent decline in primary capacity bookings on the gas transmission system.  This, in turn, puts further upward pressure on unit tariffs required to remunerate investments in the system.  In November 2012, the CER published its decision on the 5 Year Gas Networks Tariff Review (PC3) which set the revenues BGN is allowed over the period.  The decision took account of the emerging significant reductions in forecast primary bookings supplied by BGN.

It is unlikely that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 energy and climate change targets can be met through the provision of state incentives alone.  A move to a market-based programme is a logical step in mainstreaming energy efficiency within the energy supply sector in line with EU ambitions.<\/p><p>Energy suppliers have the option of either signing a voluntary energy savings agreement with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) or being subject to a statutory Energy Efficiency Notice issued under the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2012.<\/p><p>The following 16 energy supply companies have signed voluntary energy savings agreements in lieu of an Energy Efficiency Notice for the period 2011-2013:<\/p><p>-Airtricity<\/p><p>-Bord G&aacute;is Energy<\/p><p>-Bord na M&oacute;na<\/p><p>-Energia<\/p><p>-Electric Ireland<\/p><p>-VAYU<\/p><p>-Irish Petroleum Industry Association (includes ConocoPhillips, ESSO, Inver, Maxol, Valero, Tedcastles, Topaz)<\/p><p>-Calor<\/p><p>-Arigna Fuels<\/p><p>-Stafford Fuels.<\/p><p>Energy suppliers that have signed voluntary agreements with the SEAI are known as Participating Energy Suppliers (PES).  These companies account for over 90% of the overall Energy Supplier Target that needs to be achieved by the end of 2013.  The SEAI is in the process of finalising the 2013 Annual Plans from these companies.  The Department and the SEAI are also in discussions with a small number of additional energy suppliers who have not yet finalised voluntary agreements.<\/p><p>A three year programme target of 2,000GWh was set for the period 2011-2013; to be achieved by a combination of energy supplier-led initiatives and SEAI programme activity.  The target for 2011 was 500GWh, which was met (533GWh were delivered).  The combined target for 2012 and 2013 is 750GWh.<\/p><p>It is not possible to provide the specific energy savings achieved by individual energy suppliers, as targets are based on commercially sensitive energy sales data, provided to the SEAI for analysis on a confidential basis.  Table 1 provides a breakdown of energy savings, as opposed to CO2 savings, achieved by sector on an annual basis for all savings achieved; Table 2 provides a breakdown of energy savings achieved by sector for savings achieved in the residential sector. Projects from 2009-2011 were bundled into one group as energy suppliers were permitted to report historic savings and count these against the 2011 target.<\/p><p>The energy credits available for each measure in residential properties is outlined at Table 3.<\/p><p>It is not possible at this time to provide a cost per kWh for energy suppliers to achieve their target, as this will vary depending on the delivery method and the sector.  However, the Department and the SEAI are engaged in an economic analysis of the programme at present.<\/p><p>Information supplied by the SEAI shows that 81% of the target for 2011 and 2012 was achieved by the end of 2012.  While this is a positive start, and indicative of a start-up period during which energy suppliers had to set up internal systems, there will need to be a substantial increase in engagement from energy suppliers in 2013 in order to achieve the necessary energy savings targets.<\/p><p>Legislation is already in place requiring energy suppliers to offer homeowners energy saving products.  Where a Participating Energy Supplier is not complying or is not likely to comply with the terms of a voluntary agreement, the Minister may revoke his approval of a voluntary agreement and issue an energy efficiency notice under Section 11 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2012.  In this case, or in cases where a voluntary agreement between an energy supplier and the SEAI is not in place, the provisions of Section 11 (2) allow the Minister to require the energy supplier to take appropriate steps to address the deficiency.<\/p><p>Failure to comply satisfactorily with an energy efficiency notice may result in the Minister issuing a direction under Section 11 (7), specifying the remedial action the energy supplier should take and the timeframe this should be completed in.  In the event of continued non-compliance following a direction, the Minister may apply to the High Court for an order directing the energy supplier to comply with the direction.<\/p><p>The publication of the Energy Efficiency Directive in November 2012 provides for Member States to establish Energy Supplier Obligation Schemes. This is a standing item for discussion with energy suppliers at the quarterly governance meeting chaired by my Department. Decisions on a replacement for the existing programme, including mandatory targets, will be informed by the economic analysis currently being undertaken, performance of the energy suppliers and the distance to target that remains to be delivered at the end of 2013.  I expect to be in a position to communicate my decision regarding the replacement programme later this year.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 - Energy savings achieved by sector <\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Industry Sector*<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2011 (GWh)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2012 (GWh)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Total (GWh)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Electricity <\/td><td><div>96.43<\/div><\/td><td><div>55.67<\/div><\/td><td><div>152.09<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gas<\/td><td><div>53.07<\/div><\/td><td><div>25.52<\/div><\/td><td><div>78.59<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oil<\/td><td><div>13.15<\/div><\/td><td><div>50.02<\/div><\/td><td><div>63.17<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Solid Fuel <\/td><td><div>27.2<\/div><\/td><td><div>49.56<\/div><\/td><td><div>76.76<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total<\/b><\/td><td><div><b>189.85<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>180.77<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>370.62<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>*As industry is split into sectors depending on their majority business, a company which sells 60% electricity and 40% gas is recorded as electricity.<\/p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash;

Details of broadband services available on a County-by-County basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Laois, NBS services are available within 28 of its 98 Electoral Divisions.  Under EU State Aid rules, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.<\/p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to almost all applicants under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them, including applicants from County Laois.<\/p><p>  In addition to consumer services, there is a State-funded Metropolitan Area Network in Portlaoise.  These networks provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the region.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  Specifically, it commits to: 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015, At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Laois, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":995,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":994,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT00350"},{"type":"question","counter":995,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[8049\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the restrictions that exist in locating wind turbines in areas or habitats in which red grouse live; the scientific basis for the restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":996,"content":"<p>The Wind Energy Development Guidelines, published by my Department in 2006, provide advice to planning authorities on the consideration of a range of factors relating to wind energy through the development plan process.

To ensure effective targeting of resources, loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only. Income limits are also in place, distinguishing between single and dual income households and a maximum loan limit is applied.  In assessing loan applications local authorities take account of the household&rsquo;s ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment\/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged\/salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection.  In such cases long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;332.7m in 2012, with an anticipated outturn of some &euro;299m for 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities have been operating, a tentative out-turn in the order of 4,000 housing units was achieved in 2012.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.  However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as social leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.<\/p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA in the current year and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1025,"content":"<p>Question No. 495 answered with Question No. 487.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Merchandising of Coal","counter":1026,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1027,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[8267\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on changes in the merchandising of all coals from 1 May 2013; the way these changes will impact on different merchants with different sized turnover and different distribution methodologies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1028,"content":"<p>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuel (or &lsquo;smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known) was first introduced in Dublin in 1990 in response to severe episodes of winter smog that resulted from the widespread use of smoky coal for residential heating.  Air quality monitoring carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that the ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin and the ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas. The ban currently applies in twenty cities and towns.<\/p><p>  The main legislative provisions that apply inside specified smoky coal ban areas are as follows: a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuel; requirement to sell smokeless coal in sealed bags with a printed notice; requirement to maintain a register if storing bituminous fuel for the purpose of placing on the market or on sale at a separate location outside the ban area; bituminous fuel can only be transported in minimum quantities of 3 metric tonnes in Dublin or 1 tonne inside other ban areas; and drivers of vehicles transporting bituminous fuel must hold a record detailing the type of fuel on board, who supplied it and where it is being transported to.<\/p><p>  On 31 August 2012, following a public consultation process, I gave effect to new consolidating solid fuel regulations, the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012. Some improved and updated provisions were introduced that will help to ensure that the Regulations remain fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.  These are as follows: most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account; seven new\u00a0 towns will be added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel was provided for, to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution.<\/p><p>  The Regulations also require that all bituminous coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.  This consolidates the environmental and related human health benefits achieved by an earlier voluntary agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers.<\/p><p>  Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in bituminous coal must be registered with the EPA.  Those who must register include all fuel wholesalers and distributors of bituminous coal but only those retailers for whom 50% or more of their total annual sales proceeds are from bituminous coal.  However all retailers who trade in bituminous coal must ensure that their fuel wholesalers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number.<\/p><p>  The Regulations continue to be enforced by local authority authorised persons.  Authorised persons may undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel as well as collect samples.  A local authority may bring a prosecution under section 11 of the Air Pollution Act 1987 for breaches of the Regulations.  The maximum penalty for breaches of the Regulations is a fine of &euro;5,000 and\/or imprisonment for up to six months on summary conviction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1029,"content":"<p>Question No. 497 answered with Question No. 493.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Recruitment","counter":1030,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1031,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[8280\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if there is any recruitment moratorium for fire and emergency services; and if so, whether it is possible to say at what point that moratorium will be brought to an end.","asker":"1011","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1032,"content":"<p>The embargo on the filling of posts in the Local Government Service was introduced on 24 March 2009 following a Government Decision to implement savings measures across the wider public service.

In a February 1995 report to my Department, <i>Identification of the Outer Limits of Estuaries in Ireland<\/i>, the EPA, in consultation with the authorities in Northern Ireland, established the outer limit of the estuary of the Foyle river in that context.  The objective criteria used in the establishment of these limits were geomorphic and chemical (i.e. salinity) factors.  I understand that alternative criteria were used by the UK authorities in establishing the limits in the Severn and Humber estuaries.<\/p><p><br \/>  The outer limit of Lough Foyle was subsequently used in the identification of the estuary as a transitional water under the Water Framework Directive and the remaining waters of the Lough outside this boundary as a coastal water, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 7 of the European Communities (Water Policy) Regulations, 2003.  All surface water and groundwater bodies have been classified in accordance with these Regulations which give effect to the Water Framework Directive.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Water Framework Directive is an overarching Directive that establishes a framework for the management of water resources in the European Union.  It requires, <i>inter alia,<\/i> the achievement of good ecological status in all surface waters, the definition of which includes both transitional and coastal waters.  As regards environmental objectives, the Water Framework Directive draws no distinction between transitional waters and coastal waters; there is no question of a looser environmental protection associated with the classification of water bodies as either transitional or coastal waters.  The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is one of the basic measures of the Water Framework Directive.<\/p><p><br \/>  Discussions regarding the question of jurisdiction over the Foyle and Carlingford Estuaries are a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I understand these discussions are ongoing.  While resolution of the jurisdictional issues should further assist in the implementation of environmental law, including relevant EU Directives, there is already excellent ongoing cooperation between the authorities in both jurisdictions on matters relating to the environment, many of which are mandated to the North South Ministerial Council established under the British Irish Agreement.<\/p><p><br \/>  The designation of sites under the Ramsar Convention is a matter for my colleague the nister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I understand that Ireland currently has 45 designated sites (almost 67,000 hectares) under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance.  I also understand that Ireland&#8217;s priorities and resources in relation to site designations are currently focused on fully implementing the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive and the EU Birds Directive (EU Nature Directives).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900087#WRT04900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":1056,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900088#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1057,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[8314\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900088#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm that a risk assessment was undertaken to substantiate the new Critical Attendance Standard Policies within the Keeping Communities Safe Policy Document; if he will confirm that a copy of the risk assessment will be made publicly available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1058,"content":"<p>I have recently published Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) as national policy for the future direction of fire services in Ireland.

In distributing Local Property Tax income to local authorities through the Local Government Fund, I will seek to ensure that a significant proportion of the tax is retained in the local authority area in which it is collected in order to fund essential local services in our communities.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Currently, general purpose grants from the local government fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time: that is, a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.  Local authority cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex.  A number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In time, local authorities may vary the local rate of the Local Property Tax.

By this definition, the vast majority of Travellers\/Roma in the Irish State are indigenous Irish Travellers. There are no official statistics on the number of Roma in Ireland. A figure of 3,000 (approximately 0.07% of the population) has been cited by the Roma Support Group Pavee Point. However, the vast majority of Roma in this State are EU citizens and, as such, in terms of immigration controls, are covered by the provision of the European Communities (Free movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. Such persons are not required to register their presence in the State.<\/p><p>  Ireland's National Traveller\/Roma Strategy was developed following a  communication from the EU Commission entitled &ldquo;An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies&quot; (April 2011) which requested that member states would, in proportion to the size of the Roma population living in their territories and taking into account their different starting points, adopt or develop further a comprehensive approach to Roma integration.This document thus includes relevant strategies that already exist in the four crucial areas of education, employment, healthcare and housing.  It also mentions initiatives in place in the same areas to assist the Roma community who are citizens of the European Economic Area and are legally resident in the country.  It should be noted that Traveller representatives are active participants on National Committees dealing with policy in all four areas and, in this way, were involved in the development of these policies. The Irish Strategy document is envisaged to be a living document and as time goes on there is nothing to prevent the development and inclusion of new actions in any of the sectors; however the actions in the Strategy are at present generic actions in relation to the population covered rather than Roma-specific.<\/p><p>  My Department's role in the Strategy is one of coordination while the development of particular policy and implementation including targets, timelines and budgets as referred to by the Deputy are a matter for my Government colleagues in the relevant Government Departments.<\/p><p>  In the Commission's assessment of the National Strategies, Ireland was identified as having a strong monitoring and review mechanism for adapting the strategy. Based on the assessment of all Member States, a set of policy recommendations in each section points to priorities that all Member States should further address, depending on their national circumstances, in order to meet their responsibilities.In this context it is envisaged that further actions will be developed for Ireland when and where it is deemed necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRV04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport","counter":1166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1167,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[8352\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"of the 213 Garda vehicles purchased in 2012, the number of that were marked Garda cars, unmarked Garda cars and marked Garda vans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1168,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of Garda transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the information requested by the Deputy is as shown in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th colspan=\"2\"><div><b>Patrol Vehicles<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Vans<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Motorbikes<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Total<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Marked<\/div><\/td><td><div>Unmarked<\/div><\/td><td><div>Marked<\/div><\/td><td><div>Marked<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>183<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>213<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I made an additional &euro;3 million available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure the total of 213 vehicles in 2012.

The Policing Plan outlines the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to make a final decision on the date of closure of Stepaside Garda Station and I have no function in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Stepaside is in the Blackrock District in the Dublin Metropolitan Eastern Division. It is approximately 8 kilometres from the District Headquarters at Blackrock Garda Station and approximately 6 kilometres from Dundrum Garda Station.  As of 31 January 2013, there are 35 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Stepaside Garda Station. The Commissioner has indicated that these members will, insofar as possible, remain in the Blackrock District.  The majority will be allocated to Dundrum Garda Station and some will be allocated to Blackrock Garda Station.<\/p><p>  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.  The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside Garda Station will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of the community there.  Nationally, revised policing arrangements will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests. Local Garda management have engaged and will continue to engage with communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements following the closure of any particular Garda station. The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service is provided to the public at all times.<\/p><p>  Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of both Garda personnel and transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner. Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  I understand, however, that of the new vehicles coming on stream, 22 of these will be allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  A more detailed breakdown is not currently available and the Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.<\/p><p>  The closure of any particular Garda Station will not affect the procedure for the Garda response to emergency calls which will continue as it is at present e.g. in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (which includes Stepaside) the call to 999 or 112 will initially be taken by BT, who operate the Emergency Calls Answering Service, and then, if the emergency requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, referred immediately to the Garda Command and Control Centre in Harcourt Square.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion under the Act and the information sought by the Deputy could not be obtained without a disproportionate use of resources.   Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and I can inform the Deputy that the District Courts granted 54,092 criminal legal aid certificates in 2011 and 49,639 in 2012.

In addition, Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him\/herself in person or through legal assistance of his\/her own choosing or, if he\/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will appreciate that the criminal legal aid scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.

If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed.

In accordance with EU legislation, testing is carried out at farm level and in the primary processing facilities (slaughterhouses) because these are the most suitable locations for testing for the presence of illegal substances. In particular, where an equine has been treated with phenylbutazone (commonly referred to as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;), the positives for residues of the medicine are more likely to be detected in a fresh meat sample rather than a processed meat sample as this substance is not a very stable compound and breaks down quite quickly. Tests are not routinely carried out at secondary processing plants or prepared products. National Residue testing is carried out on an ongoing basis throughout the year at farm and slaughterhouse level with 19,500 tests completed last year.   In addition, primary processors are required to carry out self-monitoring plans for the detection of residues of substances, veterinary medicines and contaminants. <\/p><p>  With regard to Phenylbutazone (Bute), testing is conducted every year under the NRCP as part of the testing programme for substances in category B2 (e) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Testing for Bute is carried out in samples from bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine animals as well as poultry, farmed game and milk.   In 2011, 12,575 horses were slaughtered and approx 280 equine samples were tested, 58 for Bute.  Final equine slaughter figures are not yet available for 2012 but approximately 330 samples were tested, 104 for Bute. As in the case of residues generally, testing is not routinely conducted on processed or prepared products. <\/p><p>  One positive sample for phenylbutazone was found under the National Residue Control Plan in 2010 at a level of 10 parts per billion (10ppb).   While the result was above the minimum limit detectable, it was at an extremely low level in terms of human health risk.  A follow up investigation was conducted by DAFM and resulted in an increase in testing of animals presented by the owner of the animal from which the positive sample was derived. No further positives were detected.  <\/p><p>As agreed at the meeting which I convened last week, it has been agreed at EU level to introduce an EU wide month programme of control measures, including significant testing of samples for bute.  The intention behind the programme is to publish the findings of the first month&rsquo;s testing on 15th   April following their presentation to the Commission, and then review the programme. The results of this control programme would provide an evidence base for the possible consideration of further risk based measures. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1392,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[8881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their disdavantaged area payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1393,"content":"<p>While the person named successfully applied for derogation in regard to the 2011 stocking density, payment has not issued as the holding does not, as yet, satisfy the 2012 Scheme minimum stocking density requirements. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in direct contact with the applicant to request submission of the Sheep Flock Register, on receipt of which the application can be further progressed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[8888\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos 426 of 15 May 2012 and 204 of 7 march 2012, the progress that has been made on the issue of a licence for mussel farming to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1396,"content":"<p>As indicated in my previous reply to the Deputy the application referred to is in respect of a site located within Kenmare Bay which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000 site).<\/p><p>  The European Court of Justice declared in case C418\/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92\/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.  <\/p><p>  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.

This approach is consistent with the maintenance of a prioritised list which includes Kenmare Bay.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":1397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1398,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[8905\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the level of monitoring that takes place of fish produce and labelling.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1399,"content":"<p>Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is responsible for operational matters in relation to enforcement and compliance of Sea Fisheries law and areas of Food Safety law agreed with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.   <\/p><p><br \/>  There are general requirements in Regulation EC 178\/2002 and Directive 2000\/13 prohibiting the misleading of consumers with food labels.

It is my intention that the Agency will have a role in supporting families and communities.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.    With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. <\/p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.<\/p><p>  Since I took office in March, 2011 there have been 35 appointments to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department. <\/p><p>   As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  <\/p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. <\/p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of 7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. <\/p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. <\/p><p>   There are also prescribed bodies to be consulted in appointing ordinary members. The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency. Of the 10 people appointed to this Board, 9 of the 10 people were appointed after submitting expressions of interest.  The other person appointed to this Board was a Departmental representative.<\/p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   <\/p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  <\/p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that I have not made any appointments to any commercial bodies, state owned banks or the judiciary since taking office. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRAA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":1425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1426,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[8224\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"following the recently published Migrant Rights Centre Ireland Report December 2012 Part of the Family, which illustrates the way the unregulated au pair system is being used to facilitate cheap childcare and that leaves au pairs without basic protections, her plans to address the issue of au pairs here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1427,"content":"<p>The issues raised by the Deputy relate in the main to the employment rights of au pairs.

Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.<\/p><p>  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including child care costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive a subsidy of &euro;95 per week towards full-day child care costs.<\/p><p>  Approximately 19,000 families availed of subvention under the CCS programme in the September 2011-August 2012 period.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.<\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.<\/p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy","counter":1457,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRBB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1458,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[8219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the outcome and results of the review of local drugs task forces; the details of any changes to their funding which is being considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1459,"content":"<p>On 18 December 2012, I announced details of a series of measures arising from a review of Drugs Task Forces and the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.<\/p><p>  The person's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income (which would include any rental income) and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect.<\/p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<\/p><p>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p><p>  1. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.<\/p><p>  2. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms\/businesses in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  3. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<\/p><p>  4. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p>  5. If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  <\/p><p>6. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.<\/p><p>  7. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc.<\/p><p>  If a person avails of the Nursing Home Loan, the money advanced by way of the loan must be repaid as follows:<\/p><p>- If the repayment arises because of the death of the person in care, it must be repaid within 12 months of the date of death. Otherwise interest will apply from the date of death. <\/p><p>- If the repayment arises because the property is sold\/transferred during the person in care&rsquo;s lifetime, it must be repaid within 6 months of the date of the sale\/transfer, otherwise interest will apply back to that date.<\/p><p>  If a person's principal residence is sold (whether or not they are availing of the Nursing Home Loan), the proceeds of the sale are treated as cash assets and would not be subject to the three year cap. Cash assets are currently taken into account at 5% per annum for as long as the person remains in nursing home care.  <\/p><p>  The Scheme includes a five year anti-avoidance mechanism, i.e. any income or assets transferred within the five years prior to applying for the scheme are taken into account in the financial assessment.  This is necessary in order to ensure that the scheme is fair to all and financially sustainable.  <\/p><p>  It is not clear from the details supplied who is the applicant in the case referred to by the Deputy.

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of health care delivery. A major objective of the organisation is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and recipients of blood and blood products. <\/p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;. The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] of whom a significant majority consider themselves to be gay by the IBTS, is an important safety measure for blood transfusion. e decision is not based on sexuality or orientation, but because it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates in MSM in Ireland.   <\/p><p>  Testing for HIV remains very sensitive and effective but there remains a period between infection and detection that could permit the transmission to a recipient.  The medical literature contains well documented examples in the immediate past.  Although no transfusion transmitted infection anywhere is ever acceptable, in Ireland this is considered to be especially so given past experience.  The IBTS works closely with other blood services in Europe and America where this permanent deferral is retained.  Indeed, almost no developed country has no deferral period, and will all exclude sexually active gay men from donation. <\/p><p>  The UK modified their exclusion criteria to introduce a finite 12 month deferral for MSM behaviour in 2011.  Since then the IBTS has reviewed formally its position and this has been ratified by its Medical Advisory Committee and Board.  With regard to supply, there is a clear distinction to be made between transfusion safety and blood supply.  Safety cannot be compromised by supply concerns.  In addition, the number of donations likely to be obtained from MSM is unlikely to resolve any supply issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1594,"content":"<p>Question No. 702 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1596,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[8336\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a detailed progress report on the proposed closure of a hostel (details supplied) in County Kerry and the setting up of a forum as agreed at the meeting with him on 7 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1597,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1598,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1599,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[8345\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on alcohol addiction (details supplied)","asker":"1090","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1600,"content":"<p>With the approval of a Registered Medical Practitioner, a person may choose, on a voluntary basis, to be admitted to and treated in an approved Mental Health centre for a range of Mental Health issues including depression and self harm.

During their consultation process, the Group received many representations regarding the detention process set out in the Act.  The Group have recommended, inter alia, that a person should be detained for treatment as a last resort and that the Act should be underpinned by the least restrictive principle, stressing that the patient should not be detained longer than is absolutely necessary.  It is also recommended that the revised Act should incorporate human rights focused guiding principles, with the autonomy principle being central to the detention provisions in the Act.<\/p><p>  An Expert Group is now in place to conduct the second and substantial phase of the review of the Act and the Group's report is expected in quarter two 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1602,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[8348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in respect of a medical card application in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; when the medical card will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1603,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":1604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1605,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[8356\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the ambulance service in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1606,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","counter":1607,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1608,"qnumday":707,"qnumall":"[8366\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900089#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will identify the hospitals and or healthcare centres at which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1609,"content":"<p>A group within the HSE is updating guidance on the prevention and control of Legionellosis in Ireland.

It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate.

The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.

Prevention of HCAIs and infection of hospital patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AMR) is a key patient safety and clinical quality initiative for the Irish health care service.The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) \/ HSE Clinical Advisory Group on HCAIshas established a national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR. The overall aim of the programme is that every health care worker and all parts of the health care system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAI and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance and that our health care systems have processes in place to ensure safe health care is reliable delivered irrespective of the health care setting.<\/p><p>  The clinical programme's remit includes the development of national clinical guidelines, provision of patient and public information on HCAIs, campaigns on hand hygiene, hospital and community antibiotic prescribing, prevention of medical device related infections, inter-sectoral AMR control and the continuing development of bloodstream infection surveillance in conjunction with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).<\/p><p>  Recent publication of 14 hospital hygiene inspection reports by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) under its National Infection Prevention and Control Standards indicate general satisfaction with hygiene compliance but underline improvements required in certain facilities.HIQA will conduct further inspections during 2013 in a subset of these facilities and the relevant hospitals will continue to be supported in implementing quality improvement plans to further comply with the Standards.

The Policing Plan outlines the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to make a final decision on the date of closure of Stepaside Garda Station and I have no function in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Stepaside is in the Blackrock District in the Dublin Metropolitan Eastern Division. It is approximately 8 kilometres from the District Headquarters at Blackrock Garda Station and approximately 6 kilometres from Dundrum Garda Station.  As of 31 January 2013, there are 35 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Stepaside Garda Station. The Commissioner has indicated that these members will, insofar as possible, remain in the Blackrock District.  The majority will be allocated to Dundrum Garda Station and some will be allocated to Blackrock Garda Station.<\/p><p>  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.  The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside Garda Station will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of the community there.  Nationally, revised policing arrangements will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests. Local Garda management have engaged and will continue to engage with communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements following the closure of any particular Garda station. The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service is provided to the public at all times.<\/p><p>  Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of both Garda personnel and transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner. Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  I understand, however, that of the new vehicles coming on stream, 22 of these will be allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  A more detailed breakdown is not currently available and the Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.<\/p><p>  The closure of any particular Garda Station will not affect the procedure for the Garda response to emergency calls which will continue as it is at present e.g. in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (which includes Stepaside) the call to 999 or 112 will initially be taken by BT, who operate the Emergency Calls Answering Service, and then, if the emergency requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, referred immediately to the Garda Command and Control Centre in Harcourt Square.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion under the Act and the information sought by the Deputy could not be obtained without a disproportionate use of resources.   Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and I can inform the Deputy that the District Courts granted 54,092 criminal legal aid certificates in 2011 and 49,639 in 2012.

In addition, Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him\/herself in person or through legal assistance of his\/her own choosing or, if he\/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will appreciate that the criminal legal aid scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.

This virus causes mild transient disease manifesting as a drop in milk production, fever and sometimes diarrhoea  in adult cattle.

Exposure of non-pregnant animals to the virus may, in fact, be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine.

If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed.

In accordance with EU legislation, testing is carried out at farm level and in the primary processing facilities (slaughterhouses) because these are the most suitable locations for testing for the presence of illegal substances. In particular, where an equine has been treated with phenylbutazone (commonly referred to as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;), the positives for residues of the medicine are more likely to be detected in a fresh meat sample rather than a processed meat sample as this substance is not a very stable compound and breaks down quite quickly. Tests are not routinely carried out at secondary processing plants or prepared products. National Residue testing is carried out on an ongoing basis throughout the year at farm and slaughterhouse level with 19,500 tests completed last year.   In addition, primary processors are required to carry out self-monitoring plans for the detection of residues of substances, veterinary medicines and contaminants. <\/p><p>  With regard to Phenylbutazone (Bute), testing is conducted every year under the NRCP as part of the testing programme for substances in category B2 (e) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Testing for Bute is carried out in samples from bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine animals as well as poultry, farmed game and milk.   In 2011, 12,575 horses were slaughtered and approx 280 equine samples were tested, 58 for Bute.  Final equine slaughter figures are not yet available for 2012 but approximately 330 samples were tested, 104 for Bute. As in the case of residues generally, testing is not routinely conducted on processed or prepared products. <\/p><p>  One positive sample for phenylbutazone was found under the National Residue Control Plan in 2010 at a level of 10 parts per billion (10ppb).   While the result was above the minimum limit detectable, it was at an extremely low level in terms of human health risk.  A follow up investigation was conducted by DAFM and resulted in an increase in testing of animals presented by the owner of the animal from which the positive sample was derived. No further positives were detected.  <\/p><p>As agreed at the meeting which I convened last week, it has been agreed at EU level to introduce an EU wide month programme of control measures, including significant testing of samples for bute.  The intention behind the programme is to publish the findings of the first month&rsquo;s testing on 15th   April following their presentation to the Commission, and then review the programme. The results of this control programme would provide an evidence base for the possible consideration of further risk based measures. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":2070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2071,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[8881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their disdavantaged area payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2072,"content":"<p>While the person named successfully applied for derogation in regard to the 2011 stocking density, payment has not issued as the holding does not, as yet, satisfy the 2012 Scheme minimum stocking density requirements. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in direct contact with the applicant to request submission of the Sheep Flock Register, on receipt of which the application can be further progressed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":2073,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2074,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[8888\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos 426 of 15 May 2012 and 204 of 7 march 2012, the progress that has been made on the issue of a licence for mussel farming to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2075,"content":"<p>As indicated in my previous reply to the Deputy the application referred to is in respect of a site located within Kenmare Bay which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000 site).<\/p><p>  The European Court of Justice declared in case C418\/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92\/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.  <\/p><p>  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.

This approach is consistent with the maintenance of a prioritised list which includes Kenmare Bay.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":2076,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2077,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[8905\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the level of monitoring that takes place of fish produce and labelling.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2078,"content":"<p>Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is responsible for operational matters in relation to enforcement and compliance of Sea Fisheries law and areas of Food Safety law agreed with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.   <\/p><p><br \/>  There are general requirements in Regulation EC 178\/2002 and Directive 2000\/13 prohibiting the misleading of consumers with food labels.

It is my intention that the Agency will have a role in supporting families and communities.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.    With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. <\/p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.<\/p><p>  Since I took office in March, 2011 there have been 35 appointments to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department. <\/p><p>   As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  <\/p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. <\/p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of 7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. <\/p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. <\/p><p>   There are also prescribed bodies to be consulted in appointing ordinary members. The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency. Of the 10 people appointed to this Board, 9 of the 10 people were appointed after submitting expressions of interest.  The other person appointed to this Board was a Departmental representative.<\/p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   <\/p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  <\/p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that I have not made any appointments to any commercial bodies, state owned banks or the judiciary since taking office. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRAA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":2104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2105,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[8224\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"following the recently published Migrant Rights Centre Ireland Report December 2012 Part of the Family, which illustrates the way the unregulated au pair system is being used to facilitate cheap childcare and that leaves au pairs without basic protections, her plans to address the issue of au pairs here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2106,"content":"<p>The issues raised by the Deputy relate in the main to the employment rights of au pairs.

Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.<\/p><p>  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including child care costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive a subsidy of &euro;95 per week towards full-day child care costs.<\/p><p>  Approximately 19,000 families availed of subvention under the CCS programme in the September 2011-August 2012 period.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.<\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.<\/p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy","counter":2136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRBB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2137,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[8219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the outcome and results of the review of local drugs task forces; the details of any changes to their funding which is being considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2138,"content":"<p>On 18 December 2012, I announced details of a series of measures arising from a review of Drugs Task Forces and the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.<\/p><p>  The person's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income (which would include any rental income) and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect.<\/p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<\/p><p>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p><p>  1. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.<\/p><p>  2. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms\/businesses in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  3. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<\/p><p>  4. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p>  5. If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  <\/p><p>6. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.<\/p><p>  7. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc.<\/p><p>  If a person avails of the Nursing Home Loan, the money advanced by way of the loan must be repaid as follows:<\/p><p>- If the repayment arises because of the death of the person in care, it must be repaid within 12 months of the date of death. Otherwise interest will apply from the date of death. <\/p><p>- If the repayment arises because the property is sold\/transferred during the person in care&rsquo;s lifetime, it must be repaid within 6 months of the date of the sale\/transfer, otherwise interest will apply back to that date.<\/p><p>  If a person's principal residence is sold (whether or not they are availing of the Nursing Home Loan), the proceeds of the sale are treated as cash assets and would not be subject to the three year cap. Cash assets are currently taken into account at 5% per annum for as long as the person remains in nursing home care.  <\/p><p>  The Scheme includes a five year anti-avoidance mechanism, i.e. any income or assets transferred within the five years prior to applying for the scheme are taken into account in the financial assessment.  This is necessary in order to ensure that the scheme is fair to all and financially sustainable.  <\/p><p>  It is not clear from the details supplied who is the applicant in the case referred to by the Deputy.

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of health care delivery. A major objective of the organisation is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and recipients of blood and blood products. <\/p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;. The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] of whom a significant majority consider themselves to be gay by the IBTS, is an important safety measure for blood transfusion. e decision is not based on sexuality or orientation, but because it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates in MSM in Ireland.   <\/p><p>  Testing for HIV remains very sensitive and effective but there remains a period between infection and detection that could permit the transmission to a recipient.  The medical literature contains well documented examples in the immediate past.  Although no transfusion transmitted infection anywhere is ever acceptable, in Ireland this is considered to be especially so given past experience.  The IBTS works closely with other blood services in Europe and America where this permanent deferral is retained.  Indeed, almost no developed country has no deferral period, and will all exclude sexually active gay men from donation. <\/p><p>  The UK modified their exclusion criteria to introduce a finite 12 month deferral for MSM behaviour in 2011.  Since then the IBTS has reviewed formally its position and this has been ratified by its Medical Advisory Committee and Board.  With regard to supply, there is a clear distinction to be made between transfusion safety and blood supply.  Safety cannot be compromised by supply concerns.  In addition, the number of donations likely to be obtained from MSM is unlikely to resolve any supply issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2273,"content":"<p>Question No. 702 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2275,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[8336\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a detailed progress report on the proposed closure of a hostel (details supplied) in County Kerry and the setting up of a forum as agreed at the meeting with him on 7 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2276,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2278,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[8345\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on alcohol addiction (details supplied)","asker":"1090","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2279,"content":"<p>With the approval of a Registered Medical Practitioner, a person may choose, on a voluntary basis, to be admitted to and treated in an approved Mental Health centre for a range of Mental Health issues including depression and self harm.

Subject to certain safeguards, a person may be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre and detained there on the grounds that he or she is suffering from a mental disorder.

During their consultation process, the Group received many representations regarding the detention process set out in the Act.  The Group have recommended, inter alia, that a person should be detained for treatment as a last resort and that the Act should be underpinned by the least restrictive principle, stressing that the patient should not be detained longer than is absolutely necessary.  It is also recommended that the revised Act should incorporate human rights focused guiding principles, with the autonomy principle being central to the detention provisions in the Act.<\/p><p>  An Expert Group is now in place to conduct the second and substantial phase of the review of the Act and the Group's report is expected in quarter two 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2281,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[8348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in respect of a medical card application in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; when the medical card will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2282,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":2283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2284,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[8356\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the ambulance service in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2285,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","counter":2286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2287,"qnumday":707,"qnumall":"[8366\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900090#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will identify the hospitals and or healthcare centres at which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2288,"content":"<p>A group within the HSE is updating guidance on the prevention and control of Legionellosis in Ireland.

It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate.

The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.

Prevention of HCAIs and infection of hospital patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AMR) is a key patient safety and clinical quality initiative for the Irish health care service.The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) \/ HSE Clinical Advisory Group on HCAIshas established a national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR. The overall aim of the programme is that every health care worker and all parts of the health care system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAI and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance and that our health care systems have processes in place to ensure safe health care is reliable delivered irrespective of the health care setting.<\/p><p>  The clinical programme's remit includes the development of national clinical guidelines, provision of patient and public information on HCAIs, campaigns on hand hygiene, hospital and community antibiotic prescribing, prevention of medical device related infections, inter-sectoral AMR control and the continuing development of bloodstream infection surveillance in conjunction with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).<\/p><p>  Recent publication of 14 hospital hygiene inspection reports by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) under its National Infection Prevention and Control Standards indicate general satisfaction with hygiene compliance but underline improvements required in certain facilities.HIQA will conduct further inspections during 2013 in a subset of these facilities and the relevant hospitals will continue to be supported in implementing quality improvement plans to further comply with the Standards. Additional hospitals will also be inspected.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the measures in place to control and prevent HCAIs and AMR in health facilities are yielding the required results (for example the drop of 55% in MRSA rates in the last six years) and that ongoing work programmes will continue to address this central challenge for all health service providers.

The Policing Plan outlines the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to make a final decision on the date of closure of Stepaside Garda Station and I have no function in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Stepaside is in the Blackrock District in the Dublin Metropolitan Eastern Division. It is approximately 8 kilometres from the District Headquarters at Blackrock Garda Station and approximately 6 kilometres from Dundrum Garda Station.  As of 31 January 2013, there are 35 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Stepaside Garda Station. The Commissioner has indicated that these members will, insofar as possible, remain in the Blackrock District.  The majority will be allocated to Dundrum Garda Station and some will be allocated to Blackrock Garda Station.<\/p><p>  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.  The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside Garda Station will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of the community there.  Nationally, revised policing arrangements will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests. Local Garda management have engaged and will continue to engage with communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements following the closure of any particular Garda station. The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service is provided to the public at all times.<\/p><p>  Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of both Garda personnel and transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner. Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  I understand, however, that of the new vehicles coming on stream, 22 of these will be allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  A more detailed breakdown is not currently available and the Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.<\/p><p>  The closure of any particular Garda Station will not affect the procedure for the Garda response to emergency calls which will continue as it is at present e.g. in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (which includes Stepaside) the call to 999 or 112 will initially be taken by BT, who operate the Emergency Calls Answering Service, and then, if the emergency requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, referred immediately to the Garda Command and Control Centre in Harcourt Square.  The Command and Control Centre will direct the necessary Garda resources to the location of the emergency.  This is done without reference to a Garda station.<\/p><p>  In the case of an emergency requiring an urgent Garda response, such as a danger to life or risk of serious injury, a crime in progress or about to happen or an offender still at the scene or just left, members of the public should call 999 or 112.  Other Crimes should be reported directly to the nearest Garda Station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":2580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRY02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2581,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[8779\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRY02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the costs involved in transferring both the Garda&iacute; and their equipment radios, uniforms and so on, currently stationed at Stepaside Garda Station to surrounding Garda Stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2582,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Stepaside Station is currently fully operational and I am informed by the Garda authorities that at this stage it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the costs that will be associated with transferring the relevant Garda personnel and equipment to other locations.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion under the Act and the information sought by the Deputy could not be obtained without a disproportionate use of resources.   Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and I can inform the Deputy that the District Courts granted 54,092 criminal legal aid certificates in 2011 and 49,639 in 2012.  More than one certificate may be granted to any one person.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if he\/she cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  In addition, Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him\/herself in person or through legal assistance of his\/her own choosing or, if he\/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will appreciate that the criminal legal aid scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.

This virus causes mild transient disease manifesting as a drop in milk production, fever and sometimes diarrhoea  in adult cattle.

Exposure of non-pregnant animals to the virus may, in fact, be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine.

If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed.

In accordance with EU legislation, testing is carried out at farm level and in the primary processing facilities (slaughterhouses) because these are the most suitable locations for testing for the presence of illegal substances. In particular, where an equine has been treated with phenylbutazone (commonly referred to as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;), the positives for residues of the medicine are more likely to be detected in a fresh meat sample rather than a processed meat sample as this substance is not a very stable compound and breaks down quite quickly. Tests are not routinely carried out at secondary processing plants or prepared products. National Residue testing is carried out on an ongoing basis throughout the year at farm and slaughterhouse level with 19,500 tests completed last year.   In addition, primary processors are required to carry out self-monitoring plans for the detection of residues of substances, veterinary medicines and contaminants. <\/p><p>  With regard to Phenylbutazone (Bute), testing is conducted every year under the NRCP as part of the testing programme for substances in category B2 (e) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Testing for Bute is carried out in samples from bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine animals as well as poultry, farmed game and milk.   In 2011, 12,575 horses were slaughtered and approx 280 equine samples were tested, 58 for Bute.  Final equine slaughter figures are not yet available for 2012 but approximately 330 samples were tested, 104 for Bute. As in the case of residues generally, testing is not routinely conducted on processed or prepared products. <\/p><p>  One positive sample for phenylbutazone was found under the National Residue Control Plan in 2010 at a level of 10 parts per billion (10ppb).   While the result was above the minimum limit detectable, it was at an extremely low level in terms of human health risk.  A follow up investigation was conducted by DAFM and resulted in an increase in testing of animals presented by the owner of the animal from which the positive sample was derived. No further positives were detected.  <\/p><p>As agreed at the meeting which I convened last week, it has been agreed at EU level to introduce an EU wide month programme of control measures, including significant testing of samples for bute.  The intention behind the programme is to publish the findings of the first month&rsquo;s testing on 15th   April following their presentation to the Commission, and then review the programme. The results of this control programme would provide an evidence base for the possible consideration of further risk based measures. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":2712,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2713,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[8881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their disdavantaged area payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2714,"content":"<p>While the person named successfully applied for derogation in regard to the 2011 stocking density, payment has not issued as the holding does not, as yet, satisfy the 2012 Scheme minimum stocking density requirements. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in direct contact with the applicant to request submission of the Sheep Flock Register, on receipt of which the application can be further progressed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":2715,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2716,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[8888\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos 426 of 15 May 2012 and 204 of 7 march 2012, the progress that has been made on the issue of a licence for mussel farming to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2717,"content":"<p>As indicated in my previous reply to the Deputy the application referred to is in respect of a site located within Kenmare Bay which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000 site).<\/p><p>  The European Court of Justice declared in case C418\/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92\/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.  <\/p><p>  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.

This approach is consistent with the maintenance of a prioritised list which includes Kenmare Bay.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":2718,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2719,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[8905\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the level of monitoring that takes place of fish produce and labelling.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2720,"content":"<p>Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is responsible for operational matters in relation to enforcement and compliance of Sea Fisheries law and areas of Food Safety law agreed with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.   <\/p><p><br \/>  There are general requirements in Regulation EC 178\/2002 and Directive 2000\/13 prohibiting the misleading of consumers with food labels.

It is my intention that the Agency will have a role in supporting families and communities.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.    With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. <\/p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.<\/p><p>  Since I took office in March, 2011 there have been 35 appointments to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department. <\/p><p>   As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  <\/p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. <\/p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of 7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. <\/p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. <\/p><p>   There are also prescribed bodies to be consulted in appointing ordinary members. The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency. Of the 10 people appointed to this Board, 9 of the 10 people were appointed after submitting expressions of interest.  The other person appointed to this Board was a Departmental representative.<\/p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   <\/p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  <\/p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that I have not made any appointments to any commercial bodies, state owned banks or the judiciary since taking office. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRAA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":2746,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2747,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[8224\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"following the recently published Migrant Rights Centre Ireland Report December 2012 Part of the Family, which illustrates the way the unregulated au pair system is being used to facilitate cheap childcare and that leaves au pairs without basic protections, her plans to address the issue of au pairs here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2748,"content":"<p>The issues raised by the Deputy relate in the main to the employment rights of au pairs.

Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.<\/p><p>  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including child care costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive a subsidy of &euro;95 per week towards full-day child care costs.<\/p><p>  Approximately 19,000 families availed of subvention under the CCS programme in the September 2011-August 2012 period.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.<\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.<\/p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy","counter":2778,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRBB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2779,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[8219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the outcome and results of the review of local drugs task forces; the details of any changes to their funding which is being considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2780,"content":"<p>On 18 December 2012, I announced details of a series of measures arising from a review of Drugs Task Forces and the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.<\/p><p>  The person's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income (which would include any rental income) and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect.<\/p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse\/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<\/p><p>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p><p>  1. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.<\/p><p>  2. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms\/businesses in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  3. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.<\/p><p>  4. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p><p>  5. If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, s\/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  <\/p><p>6. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.<\/p><p>  7. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc.<\/p><p>  If a person avails of the Nursing Home Loan, the money advanced by way of the loan must be repaid as follows:<\/p><p>- If the repayment arises because of the death of the person in care, it must be repaid within 12 months of the date of death. Otherwise interest will apply from the date of death. <\/p><p>- If the repayment arises because the property is sold\/transferred during the person in care&rsquo;s lifetime, it must be repaid within 6 months of the date of the sale\/transfer, otherwise interest will apply back to that date.<\/p><p>  If a person's principal residence is sold (whether or not they are availing of the Nursing Home Loan), the proceeds of the sale are treated as cash assets and would not be subject to the three year cap. Cash assets are currently taken into account at 5% per annum for as long as the person remains in nursing home care.  <\/p><p>  The Scheme includes a five year anti-avoidance mechanism, i.e. any income or assets transferred within the five years prior to applying for the scheme are taken into account in the financial assessment.  This is necessary in order to ensure that the scheme is fair to all and financially sustainable.  <\/p><p>  It is not clear from the details supplied who is the applicant in the case referred to by the Deputy.

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of health care delivery. A major objective of the organisation is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and recipients of blood and blood products. <\/p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;. The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] of whom a significant majority consider themselves to be gay by the IBTS, is an important safety measure for blood transfusion. e decision is not based on sexuality or orientation, but because it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates in MSM in Ireland.   <\/p><p>  Testing for HIV remains very sensitive and effective but there remains a period between infection and detection that could permit the transmission to a recipient.  The medical literature contains well documented examples in the immediate past.  Although no transfusion transmitted infection anywhere is ever acceptable, in Ireland this is considered to be especially so given past experience.  The IBTS works closely with other blood services in Europe and America where this permanent deferral is retained.  Indeed, almost no developed country has no deferral period, and will all exclude sexually active gay men from donation. <\/p><p>  The UK modified their exclusion criteria to introduce a finite 12 month deferral for MSM behaviour in 2011.  Since then the IBTS has reviewed formally its position and this has been ratified by its Medical Advisory Committee and Board.  With regard to supply, there is a clear distinction to be made between transfusion safety and blood supply.  Safety cannot be compromised by supply concerns.  In addition, the number of donations likely to be obtained from MSM is unlikely to resolve any supply issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2915,"content":"<p>Question No. 702 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2916,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2917,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[8336\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a detailed progress report on the proposed closure of a hostel (details supplied) in County Kerry and the setting up of a forum as agreed at the meeting with him on 7 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2918,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2920,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[8345\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on alcohol addiction (details supplied)","asker":"1090","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2921,"content":"<p>With the approval of a Registered Medical Practitioner, a person may choose, on a voluntary basis, to be admitted to and treated in an approved Mental Health centre for a range of Mental Health issues including depression and self harm.

During their consultation process, the Group received many representations regarding the detention process set out in the Act.  The Group have recommended, inter alia, that a person should be detained for treatment as a last resort and that the Act should be underpinned by the least restrictive principle, stressing that the patient should not be detained longer than is absolutely necessary.  It is also recommended that the revised Act should incorporate human rights focused guiding principles, with the autonomy principle being central to the detention provisions in the Act.<\/p><p>  An Expert Group is now in place to conduct the second and substantial phase of the review of the Act and the Group's report is expected in quarter two 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2922,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2923,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[8348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in respect of a medical card application in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; when the medical card will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2924,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":2925,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2926,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[8356\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the ambulance service in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2927,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","counter":2928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2929,"qnumday":707,"qnumall":"[8366\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900091#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will identify the hospitals and or healthcare centres at which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2930,"content":"<p>A group within the HSE is updating guidance on the prevention and control of Legionellosis in Ireland.

It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate.

The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.

Prevention of HCAIs and infection of hospital patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AMR) is a key patient safety and clinical quality initiative for the Irish health care service.The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) \/ HSE Clinical Advisory Group on HCAIshas established a national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR. The overall aim of the programme is that every health care worker and all parts of the health care system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAI and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance and that our health care systems have processes in place to ensure safe health care is reliable delivered irrespective of the health care setting.<\/p><p>  The clinical programme's remit includes the development of national clinical guidelines, provision of patient and public information on HCAIs, campaigns on hand hygiene, hospital and community antibiotic prescribing, prevention of medical device related infections, inter-sectoral AMR control and the continuing development of bloodstream infection surveillance in conjunction with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).<\/p><p>  Recent publication of 14 hospital hygiene inspection reports by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) under its National Infection Prevention and Control Standards indicate general satisfaction with hygiene compliance but underline improvements required in certain facilities.HIQA will conduct further inspections during 2013 in a subset of these facilities and the relevant hospitals will continue to be supported in implementing quality improvement plans to further comply with the Standards. Additional hospitals will also be inspected.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the measures in place to control and prevent HCAIs and AMR in health facilities are yielding the required results (for example the drop of 55% in MRSA rates in the last six years) and that ongoing work programmes will continue to address this central challenge for all health service providers.

The application fee was introduced to contribute towards the costs of processing those applications that do not attract any certification fee and to help reduce the proportion of invalid and ineligible applications being lodged. The Statutory Instrument also introduced a series of changes to the application forms, in particular to facilitate applicants who are the civil partners of Irish citizens.<\/p><p>  The fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  <\/p><p>  I have no plans to alter either the application or certification fee at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":3184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3185,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[8722\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 556 of 29 January 2013, if the eight persons returned to their last port of departure from the State were Syrian nationals.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3186,"content":"<p>I am informed that all of the eight (8) persons referred to in the response to Question No. 556 of 29 January 2013, purported to being Syrian nationals and each provided an Immigration Officer with details regarding his or her name and date of birth.<\/p><p>  In considering whether to refuse leave to land at Ports of Entry, the Immigration Officer takes into account matters such as whether the person concerned has applied for asylum in another EU Member State and the authenticity of the documentation presented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Penalty Point System","counter":3187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":3188,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[8725\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he received a submission from an organisation (details supplied) dated 7 February 2013 in relation to the penalty points system and Section 63 of the 2010 Road Traffic Act; his views on the submission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3189,"content":"<p>I am informed that the submission referred to by the Deputy has been received by my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

The Policing Plan outlines the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to make a final decision on the date of closure of Stepaside Garda Station and I have no function in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Stepaside is in the Blackrock District in the Dublin Metropolitan Eastern Division. It is approximately 8 kilometres from the District Headquarters at Blackrock Garda Station and approximately 6 kilometres from Dundrum Garda Station.  As of 31 January 2013, there are 35 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Stepaside Garda Station. The Commissioner has indicated that these members will, insofar as possible, remain in the Blackrock District.  The majority will be allocated to Dundrum Garda Station and some will be allocated to Blackrock Garda Station.<\/p><p>  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.  The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside Garda Station will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of the community there.  Nationally, revised policing arrangements will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests. Local Garda management have engaged and will continue to engage with communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements following the closure of any particular Garda station. The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service is provided to the public at all times.<\/p><p>  Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of both Garda personnel and transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner. Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  I understand, however, that of the new vehicles coming on stream, 22 of these will be allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  A more detailed breakdown is not currently available and the Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.<\/p><p>  The closure of any particular Garda Station will not affect the procedure for the Garda response to emergency calls which will continue as it is at present e.g. in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (which includes Stepaside) the call to 999 or 112 will initially be taken by BT, who operate the Emergency Calls Answering Service, and then, if the emergency requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, referred immediately to the Garda Command and Control Centre in Harcourt Square.  The Command and Control Centre will direct the necessary Garda resources to the location of the emergency.  This is done without reference to a Garda station.<\/p><p>  In the case of an emergency requiring an urgent Garda response, such as a danger to life or risk of serious injury, a crime in progress or about to happen or an offender still at the scene or just left, members of the public should call 999 or 112.  Other Crimes should be reported directly to the nearest Garda Station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":3195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY02150"},{"type":"question","counter":3196,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[8779\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the costs involved in transferring both the Garda&iacute; and their equipment radios, uniforms and so on, currently stationed at Stepaside Garda Station to surrounding Garda Stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3197,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Stepaside Station is currently fully operational and I am informed by the Garda authorities that at this stage it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the costs that will be associated with transferring the relevant Garda personnel and equipment to other locations.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion under the Act and the information sought by the Deputy could not be obtained without a disproportionate use of resources.   Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and I can inform the Deputy that the District Courts granted 54,092 criminal legal aid certificates in 2011 and 49,639 in 2012.

The Deputy will appreciate that the criminal legal aid scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.

It is their view that an upper age limit for enlistment of 30 years of age would not be suitable to Defence Forces requirements.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the existing upper age requirements for recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force are appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Appointments","counter":3217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY03650"},{"type":"question","counter":3218,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[8116\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY03700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the details of all appointments made by him to all State agencies, commercial bodies and all other appointments made by him since taking office, including the State owned banks and the judiciary.","asker":"953","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":3219,"qnumday":595,"qnumall":"[8134\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY03800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the details of the qualifications of all the appointees made by him to all State agencies, commercial bodies and all other appointments made by him since taking office including the State owned banks and judiciary for the appointments they have accepted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":3220,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[8152\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900092#WRY03900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of appointees and the percentage of appointments made by him to all State agencies, commercial bodies and all other appointments made by him since taking office including the State owned banks and the Judiciary that were subject to a public applications process.","asker":"953","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3221,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 594 to 596, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Army Pensions Board is the only State Board under the aegis of my Department.<\/p><p>The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927.

This virus causes mild transient disease manifesting as a drop in milk production, fever and sometimes diarrhoea  in adult cattle.

However if ruminant animals are infected during the early stages of pregnancy, they may subsequently abort or give birth to malformed offspring. <\/p><p>  It would be impractical to attempt midge control measures, except for valuable breeding stock.  Exposure of non-pregnant animals to the virus may, in fact, be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine. Exposed animals develop a strong immunity and are unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the virus on a subsequent occasion. If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed. Based on Australian experience in vaccinating against a similar virus\/disease (Akabane virus infection), the expert view is that vaccination is likely to be an effective tool in control of the SBV infection.

In accordance with EU legislation, testing is carried out at farm level and in the primary processing facilities (slaughterhouses) because these are the most suitable locations for testing for the presence of illegal substances. In particular, where an equine has been treated with phenylbutazone (commonly referred to as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;), the positives for residues of the medicine are more likely to be detected in a fresh meat sample rather than a processed meat sample as this substance is not a very stable compound and breaks down quite quickly. Tests are not routinely carried out at secondary processing plants or prepared products. National Residue testing is carried out on an ongoing basis throughout the year at farm and slaughterhouse level with 19,500 tests completed last year.   In addition, primary processors are required to carry out self-monitoring plans for the detection of residues of substances, veterinary medicines and contaminants. <\/p><p>  With regard to Phenylbutazone (Bute), testing is conducted every year under the NRCP as part of the testing programme for substances in category B2 (e) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Testing for Bute is carried out in samples from bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine animals as well as poultry, farmed game and milk.   In 2011, 12,575 horses were slaughtered and approx 280 equine samples were tested, 58 for Bute.  Final equine slaughter figures are not yet available for 2012 but approximately 330 samples were tested, 104 for Bute. As in the case of residues generally, testing is not routinely conducted on processed or prepared products. <\/p><p>  One positive sample for phenylbutazone was found under the National Residue Control Plan in 2010 at a level of 10 parts per billion (10ppb).   While the result was above the minimum limit detectable, it was at an extremely low level in terms of human health risk.  A follow up investigation was conducted by DAFM and resulted in an increase in testing of animals presented by the owner of the animal from which the positive sample was derived. No further positives were detected.  <\/p><p>As agreed at the meeting which I convened last week, it has been agreed at EU level to introduce an EU wide month programme of control measures, including significant testing of samples for bute.  The intention behind the programme is to publish the findings of the first month&rsquo;s testing on 15th   April following their presentation to the Commission, and then review the programme. The results of this control programme would provide an evidence base for the possible consideration of further risk based measures. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900094#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":3327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900094#WRAA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":3328,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[8881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900094#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their disdavantaged area payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3329,"content":"<p>While the person named successfully applied for derogation in regard to the 2011 stocking density, payment has not issued as the holding does not, as yet, satisfy the 2012 Scheme minimum stocking density requirements. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in direct contact with the applicant to request submission of the Sheep Flock Register, on receipt of which the application can be further progressed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900094#WRAA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":3330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900094#WRAA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":3331,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[8888\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900094#WRAA02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos 426 of 15 May 2012 and 204 of 7 march 2012, the progress that has been made on the issue of a licence for mussel farming to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3332,"content":"<p>As indicated in my previous reply to the Deputy the application referred to is in respect of a site located within Kenmare Bay which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000 site).<\/p><p>  The European Court of Justice declared in case C418\/04 that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6(3) of Directive 92\/43 (Habitats Directive) in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that Directive.  <\/p><p>  In the negotiations to address the judgment a process was agreed with the European Commission which would lead to full compliance by Ireland with the relevant EU Directives.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.    With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. <\/p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.<\/p><p>  Since I took office in March, 2011 there have been 35 appointments to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department. <\/p><p>   As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  <\/p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. <\/p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of 7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. <\/p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. <\/p><p>   There are also prescribed bodies to be consulted in appointing ordinary members. The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency. Of the 10 people appointed to this Board, 9 of the 10 people were appointed after submitting expressions of interest.  The other person appointed to this Board was a Departmental representative.<\/p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   <\/p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  <\/p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that I have not made any appointments to any commercial bodies, state owned banks or the judiciary since taking office. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900094#WRAA04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":3361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900095#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3362,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[8224\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900095#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"following the recently published Migrant Rights Centre Ireland Report December 2012 Part of the Family, which illustrates the way the unregulated au pair system is being used to facilitate cheap childcare and that leaves au pairs without basic protections, her plans to address the issue of au pairs here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":3363,"content":"<p>The issues raised by the Deputy relate in the main to the employment rights of au pairs.

Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.<\/p><p>  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including child care costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.<\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.<\/p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900095#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy","counter":3393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900095#WRBB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":3394,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[8219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900095#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the outcome and results of the review of local drugs task forces; the details of any changes to their funding which is being considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3395,"content":"<p>On 18 December 2012, I announced details of a series of measures arising from a review of Drugs Task Forces and the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.

The project works directly with approx. 500 Travellers per year and indirectly to others through networking at national, regional and local events, and also provides preventative and post suicide supports.  The aim is to develop and implement a community development approach to addressing the issue of suicide in the Traveller community by; acting as a resource both to Traveller organisations and suicide related services in terms of raising their awareness on the issue of suicide in the Traveller community; promoting the development of initiatives to support suicide prevention, intervention and interventions after suicide situations, in a co-ordinated manner and, in so doing, to reduce the number of attempted and completed suicides in the Traveller community.<\/p><p><br \/>  The project aims to reduce the number of Traveller suicides over the next 10 years through the following actions:<\/p><p><br \/>  - Collate up to date data on Travellers who die by suicide and the services available to Travellers and their uptake;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Develop prevention, intervention and interventions after suicide initiatives with Travellers using a community development approach and based on the data collated and the experience of the project to date;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Effect positive policy and social change in the area of Traveller suicide;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Carry out NTSAPs planned work in a timely, efficient and effective manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  Traveller men who have in the past been reluctant to engage with services and two male project workers were recruited in September 2011 with the role of working with Traveller men nationally to focus on engaging Traveller men as well as providing ongoing support to groups in developing appropriate responses to address the identified needs.

If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.

The National Audiology Review Group developed a comprehensive set of recommendations to address the inconsistencies and inadequacies in audiology services which are contained in the HSE Report of the National Review of Audiology Services published in April 2011.   <\/p><p>  This report provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new- born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.   That report included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.<\/p><p>  Since then, the HSE Audiology Clinical Care Programme was formed to oversee the implementation of the recommendations detailed by this report.  Progress is being made on  the modernisation  of  audiology  services  in  Ireland  with the  introduction of a universal  national  programme  of new-born  hearing screening  a key priority.<\/p><p>  Beaumont Hospital is the centre for delivering Ireland&rsquo;s national cochlear implant programme, with surgical provision for patients under six (6) years carried out in the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital Temple Street.   While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential cochlear implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. \t<\/p><p>  It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when appraised of all the issues involved.<\/p><p>  I am aware that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation. An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.   The introduction of this service is a matter between the HSE and Beaumont hospital and the HSE has advised me that  these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900096#WRCC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3458,"content":"<p>Question No. 672 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":3459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900096#WRCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":3460,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[8178\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900096#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will issue a discretionary medical card as a matter of urgency in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3461,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900096#WRCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3462,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 674 and 675 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescription Charges","counter":3463,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900096#WRCC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":3464,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[8188\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900096#WRCC02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will explain the anomaly which exists between monthly prescription charges for families in which no family member has a medical card and monthly prescription charges for families when one member has a medical card on medical grounds, if no family member has a medical card, that family pays a maximum of &euro;144 per month for prescription charges, if one member of that family has a medical card on medical grounds then the family pays the &euro;144 monthly prescription charge plus &euro;1.50 per item in the medical card prescription; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3465,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[8288\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900096#WRCC02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are any proposals or provisions permitted which would accommodate persons who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of the prescription charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3466,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 676 and 692 together.<\/p><p>  The General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme and the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) are separate schemes with separate qualifying criteria. <\/p><p>  Under the GMS Scheme, medical card holders are required to pay a &euro;1.50 charge per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of  &euro;19.50 per month for each person or family.

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of health care delivery. A major objective of the organisation is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and recipients of blood and blood products. <\/p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;. The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] of whom a significant majority consider themselves to be gay by the IBTS, is an important safety measure for blood transfusion. e decision is not based on sexuality or orientation, but because it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates in MSM in Ireland.   <\/p><p>  Testing for HIV remains very sensitive and effective but there remains a period between infection and detection that could permit the transmission to a recipient.  The medical literature contains well documented examples in the immediate past.  Although no transfusion transmitted infection anywhere is ever acceptable, in Ireland this is considered to be especially so given past experience.  The IBTS works closely with other blood services in Europe and America where this permanent deferral is retained.  Indeed, almost no developed country has no deferral period, and will all exclude sexually active gay men from donation. <\/p><p>  The UK modified their exclusion criteria to introduce a finite 12 month deferral for MSM behaviour in 2011.  Since then the IBTS has reviewed formally its position and this has been ratified by its Medical Advisory Committee and Board.  With regard to supply, there is a clear distinction to be made between transfusion safety and blood supply.  Safety cannot be compromised by supply concerns.  In addition, the number of donations likely to be obtained from MSM is unlikely to resolve any supply issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3530,"content":"<p>Question No. 702 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":3531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":3532,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[8336\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a detailed progress report on the proposed closure of a hostel (details supplied) in County Kerry and the setting up of a forum as agreed at the meeting with him on 7 November 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3533,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":3534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02350"},{"type":"question","counter":3535,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[8345\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on alcohol addiction (details supplied)","asker":"1090","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3536,"content":"<p>With the approval of a Registered Medical Practitioner, a person may choose, on a voluntary basis, to be admitted to and treated in an approved Mental Health centre for a range of Mental Health issues including depression and self harm.

In order to counteract the harm caused by the use and misuse of alcohol, real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the National Substance Misuse Strategy report, which was published last year. Following consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and liaison with other Departments, my colleague, Minister of State Alex White T.D., intends to introduce specific proposals for consideration by the Government as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 sets out the criteria for involuntary admission to approved centres.  Subject to certain safeguards, a person may be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre and detained there on the grounds that he or she is suffering from a mental disorder.  Section 8(2) of the Act is clear, however, that an involuntary admission cannot be authorised by reason only of the fact that the person is 'socially deviant' or 'addicted to drugs or intoxicants'.  That does not mean that a person in either of these categories cannot be involuntarily admitted to or detained in an approved centre but for this to happen, the person must be deemed to be suffering from a mental disorder as defined in the Act. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Steering Group set up to conduct an initial Review of the Mental Health Act 2001, published it's Interim Report in June 2012.  A copy of the Report is available on my Department's website at 'http:\/\/www.dohc.ie\/publications\/int&under;report&under;sg&under;reviewMHA.html'.  During their consultation process, the Group received many representations regarding the detention process set out in the Act.  The Group have recommended, inter alia, that a person should be detained for treatment as a last resort and that the Act should be underpinned by the least restrictive principle, stressing that the patient should not be detained longer than is absolutely necessary.  It is also recommended that the revised Act should incorporate human rights focused guiding principles, with the autonomy principle being central to the detention provisions in the Act.<\/p><p>  An Expert Group is now in place to conduct the second and substantial phase of the review of the Act and the Group's report is expected in quarter two 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":3537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02550"},{"type":"question","counter":3538,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[8348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in respect of a medical card application in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; when the medical card will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3539,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":3540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":3541,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[8356\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the ambulance service in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3542,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","counter":3543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD02950"},{"type":"question","counter":3544,"qnumday":707,"qnumall":"[8366\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will identify the hospitals and or healthcare centres at which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3545,"content":"<p>A group within the HSE is updating guidance on the prevention and control of Legionellosis in Ireland.

It recommends a move to a more consistent model of service delivery in line with the Government&#8217;s mainstreaming policy of equal access for people with a disability to the appropriate service for their individual needs. It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate. It endorses the reorganisation of services for children and young people under the  Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme.  <\/p><p><br \/>  This Programme, established since 2010, aims to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised. Implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children, including those with autism, who require access to health related supports.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Review of Autism Services<i><\/i>  Report will be implemented, within existing resources and taking account of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the current climate, and within the context of parallel initiatives including the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services published in July 2012 and the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18) Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":3552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3553,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[8413\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the changes that will be made to Sligo Regional Hospital Service Plan for 2013 as a result of the recently announced hospital allocations by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3554,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":3555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03750"},{"type":"question","counter":3556,"qnumday":711,"qnumall":"[8414\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive West will provide an updated report on plans for respite care services in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3557,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Food","counter":3558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD03950"},{"type":"question","counter":3559,"qnumday":712,"qnumall":"[8427\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900097#WRDD04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has guidelines in relation to the nutritional value of meals served to overnight hospital patients; his view of the nutritional standard of meals served to persons during their stay in hospital and the importance of providing nutritional meals to recovering persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3560,"content":"<p><font color=\"#212100\">The <\/font><i><font color=\"#212100\">Healthy Catering Guidelines for Staff and Visitors in Health-care Facilities <\/font><\/i><font color=\"#212100\">was published by the Department in 2002.<\/font>  Guidelines for Preventing Under-Nutrition in Acute Hospitals were published by the Department of Health in August 2008.  <font color=\"#212100\">These guidelines are helping to achieve the recommendations outlined in the Council of Europe report, <\/font><i><font color=\"#212100\">Food and Nutritional Care in Hospitals: How to Prevent Under-Nutrition.<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#212100\"> Making healthy and nourishing food choices easily accessible to patients in acute hospitals can help reduce the incidence of under-nutrition in Irish hospitals and greatly benefit patients.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#212100\">Caterers play an important role in helping patients to make healthy and nourishing food choices.

Prevention of HCAIs and infection of hospital patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AMR) is a key patient safety and clinical quality initiative for the Irish health care service.The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) \/ HSE Clinical Advisory Group on HCAIshas established a national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR. The overall aim of the programme is that every health care worker and all parts of the health care system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAI and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance and that our health care systems have processes in place to ensure safe health care is reliable delivered irrespective of the health care setting.<\/p><p>  The clinical programme's remit includes the development of national clinical guidelines, provision of patient and public information on HCAIs, campaigns on hand hygiene, hospital and community antibiotic prescribing, prevention of medical device related infections, inter-sectoral AMR control and the continuing development of bloodstream infection surveillance in conjunction with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).<\/p><p>  Recent publication of 14 hospital hygiene inspection reports by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) under its National Infection Prevention and Control Standards indicate general satisfaction with hygiene compliance but underline improvements required in certain facilities.HIQA will conduct further inspections during 2013 in a subset of these facilities and the relevant hospitals will continue to be supported in implementing quality improvement plans to further comply with the Standards. Additional hospitals will also be inspected.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the measures in place to control and prevent HCAIs and AMR in health facilities are yielding the required results (for example the drop of 55% in MRSA rates in the last six years) and that ongoing work programmes will continue to address this central challenge for all health service providers. At present, the Health and Information Quality Authority's remit does not extend to the private sector.Officials of my Departmentare currently working on the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers.The legislative proposals are being prepared broadly in line with recommendations made in the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and are designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.The intention is to have a proportionate system which has the confidence of the public.Standards and other requirements will be enforceable through inspection and imposition of sanctions as necessary.Licensing will be targeted at areas which are not currently subject to regulation.It is expected that outline proposals for the new system of licensing should be finalised in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900098#WREE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3591,"content":"<p>Question No. 724 answered with Question No. 649.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":3592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900098#WREE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3593,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[8639\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900098#WREE02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a decision will issue on a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3594,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900098#WREE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":3595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900098#WREE02250"},{"type":"question","counter":3596,"qnumday":726,"qnumall":"[8670\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900098#WREE02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made in advancing potential primary care centres (details supplied) in County Galway having regard to agreements between the Health Service Executive and general practitioners for operation of same and further to particularise locations of each centre having regard to suitability and availability of sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3597,"content":"<p>Gort and Tuam, Co Galway are two of the 35 potential locations for primary care centres for development by way of PPP as announced in the July 2012 Infrastructure Stimulus Package.

While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air, research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to\u00a0our\u00a0tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more\u00a0than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a particularly important year for Irish tourism with The Gathering Ireland 2013 now underway and over 3,000 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to people overseas that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. In this regard the agency is undertaking cooperative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer. This activity will continue through 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900101#WRHH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Promotion","counter":3811,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900101#WRHH02450"},{"type":"question","counter":3812,"qnumday":796,"qnumall":"[8897\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900101#WRHH02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he has identified major sporting events as a means to develop and promote economic activity during the course of the current year in the context of the Gathering; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":3813,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[8898\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013021900101#WRHH02600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he continues to examine and explore the possibility of linking up major sporting events in this country with sister events in other jurisdictions throughout Europe and globally with a view to maximising economic benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3814,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 796 and 797 together. <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment\u00a0that event tourism will be prioritised in order\u00a0to continue to bring major\u00a0events to Ireland.
