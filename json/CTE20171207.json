The first item under this heading is No. 889, which is carried over from the previous meeting, from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive of the HEA, and dated 8 November.  It is a report from Dr. Richard Thorn regarding the independent review of certain matters and allegations relating to University of Limerick.

It will come up in a few minutes.  The next item is No. 955 from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is a follow-up to the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 12 October on the Transport Infrastructure Ireland financial statements.  It gives information and a breakdown of various allocations of funding.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 960 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, following up with additional information arising from the Committee of Public Accounts meeting of 9 November.  It includes information on the remediation costs of landfill sites, the results of energy efficiency changes in the Department, conservation programme for restocking of rivers and analysis of the funding to RT&Eacute; as well as a note on the Department.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 961 from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, regarding the delay in laying NAMA 's individual group company accounts.  I want to call that up on screen.  A week or two ago we noted the publication of accounts of a large number of individual companies within the NAMA group going back over a five-year period.  All had been audited on time and sent to the CRO.  All had been sent to the Department but they were not sent to the Committee of Public Accounts as was required.  It was probably an administrative oversight.  It is unusual that people overlooked the laying of these accounts before the Oireachtas.  The letter explains that and apologises for the administrative oversight.  Every year we have reviewed the NAMA group accounts, which included these individual subsidiaries, but there is information in those subsidiaries' accounts that would not have been in the consolidated accounts.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 962 from Mr. Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, replying to the committee's request for information on funding and outputs in comparison with Northern Ireland.  We will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 963 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing additional information that was sought by the committee on 16 November on the education and training boards.  We decided last week that if we had not received a comprehensive response by Tuesday, the Secretary General would be here in person to explain why we had not received a response.  We received this response from him on Tuesday, and it runs to several hundred pages in a full lever arch file.  The secretariat is putting it in electronic form to be uploaded to our correspondence file.  We have it in electronic form.  The first question we asked that day was the total funding to the education and training board sector.  The Department has given a detailed analysis in the first page, stating that it comes to &euro;1.781 billion, which is broadly the figure arrived at after the discussion.  We will have to consider the full document in due course.  I acknowledge it has been received and the volume is so big that we cannot get into it today.  It has been circulated.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 965 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing details on the progress made to complete the contributions being made by religious orders under the 2002 and 2009 agreements.  It is an ongoing process and we ask the Department to keep the committee up to date on the matter on an ongoing basis.

The questions I asked were on the annual employment survey and how it arrived at the figures for how many IDA Ireland sponsored jobs had been created.  In its response, it gives a very detailed breakdown of the verification process used by IDA Ireland in respect of grants.  That is fine.  I have no difficulty with that but it does not use the same verification process in terms of the annual employment survey.<\/p><p>They do not, for example, do site visits, payroll reports or company bank statements.  ConnectIreland has to do all of that in terms of verifying what jobs were created.  That is where the comparison comes from.  The annual employment survey is quite weak and is a self-assessment system.  Bear in mind that this is the key report we use as a benchmark for the performance of IDA Ireland.  Ultimately, it is about how many IDA Ireland sponsored jobs are created each year.  If it is a simple self-assessment process and it is not really properly back up or assessed then I have a difficulty with it.  I believe this is quite serious and I would like to come back to it at some point.  I would want to put questions to IDA Ireland in this regard.  I am not satisfied with it and every response the committee gets back from them reaffirms my concerns that the survey is quite weak in process terms.

It is only a survey.  If the Deputy wants to talk to the secretariat about that we will issue a more specific letter.  This is noted and published.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence item No. 958 is from Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, dated 24 November 2017 in regard to an individual who has made a protected disclosure regarding the Irish Prison Service.  The correspondence states that there is a review taking place in the Irish Prison Service which should be completed by the end of this year.  It is suggested that we write to the director of the Irish Prison Service and request that the committee get an information note on this review in the new year.  Do members have any comments on this? I suggest that instead of writing to the Irish Prison Service we keep the correspondence directly with the Minister, as the safest way.  This is about a protected disclosure.  We have a correspondence from the Minister and I suggest we keep that line of communication open rather than dealing the committee dealing with the body under the Department. Agreed? Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence item 959 from Deputy Jim Daly, dated 15 November 2017, relating to tracker mortgage rates converting to variable rates, and the correspondence encloses various communications with the Central Bank as well as replies to parliamentary questions that Deputy Daly has received on this matter.  As this matter is being examined by the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach I suggest that we forward this to that committee for inclusion in their examination and we will  inform Deputy Daly of same.  I have looked at the correspondence and I believe it should have gone to the other committee rather than this committee.  The secretariat will forward it on to that committee.  It is more appropriate for them.  We will also notify Deputy Daly of this.  Agreed? Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Finally I wish to raise an issue that is not an item of correspondence on the schedule.  The clerk and I have looked at a piece of correspondence in respect of a particular case that was sent to me as the Chairman of the committee, by a company concerning a client and the client's dealings with the Irish Permanent TSB, where an incorrect interest rate had been charged.  The letter and the attached documents contain a considerable amount of personal and private information about the individual concerned such as amounts borrowed, date of birth, address and income.  The matter is not within the remit of the committee and I propose to not circulate the correspondence or include it on our list.  It is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts, it is an individual case and I propose it is returned to the company who sent it to us to ask them to pursue the matter with the Financial Ombudsman who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial service providers.  This specific case came to me as the Chairman.  If it had come to me in my constituency office I might have looked at it but it is certainly not a Committee of Public Accounts matter.  We will ask the company to take it up with the Financial Ombudsman.  Agreed? Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.

Some 56% of that expenditure was charged to Vote 37 Social Protection.  The remaining 44% was charged to the Social Insurance Fund, which is funded through social insurance contributions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund for 2016, but drew attention to the issues reported on in the chapters before the committee this morning.  These are interrelated matters, on which he has previously reported.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 16 deals with the regularity of social welfare payments.  Irregular payments may arise where welfare recipients are paid amounts to which they are not entitled, or which exceed their entitlements.  This may be as a result of deliberate fraud by claimants, or as a result of errors made by claimants or by staff of the Department.  The results of fraud and error surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department over many years suggest that there is an underlying material level of payment in excess of entitlements in 2016 on both Vote and the Social Insurance Fund schemes.  <\/p> <p>  Chapter 18 deals with Department reviews of welfare schemes.  In addition to its fraud and error surveys, the Department carries out targeted reviews of claims in payment, referred to as \"control reviews\".  These aim to ensure that current recipients of scheme payments continue to meet the relevant qualifying conditions.  The need for control reviews is greater where schemes are means or income-based, and for medically-based schemes, as these are respectively more susceptible to fraud and error or non-conformity with eligibility criteria.  Chapter 18 looks at the Department&rsquo;s performance in implementing its planned control reviews. <\/p> <p>  Overall, the Department set a target to carry out one million control reviews in 2016.  As figure 18.1 in the report indicates, it achieved almost 95% of this target.  The examination noted that medical control reviews of medically-based claims are not being carried out as planned.  When a claim is approved for payment, a medical review status should be assigned to it, indicating whether and when the claim should be reviewed in the future.  Data relating to over 55,000 invalidity pension cases in payment at the end of December 2016 showed that over 4,000 claims, or 8% of the claim load, had no medical review status indicator assigned.  Even when a review status had been assigned, it was evident that cases were not reviewed within the planned time.  For example, over 4,000 cases had not been reviewed for three to five years despite having a review indicator of two years or less assigned to the claim.  The report recommends an increase in the number of cases in payment being medically reviewed each year, and that a process be implemented to ensure all cases are risk categorised by having a medical review status indicator assigned including \"do not refer again\" where appropriate.<\/p><p>With regard to the family income supplement scheme, the report found that more than 10,000 claims had been automatically renewed by the Department in 2014-15, due to resourcing constraints, without being subject to the usual checking procedures.  This created a risk that some claimants may have received payments to which they were no longer entitled.  The report recommends that where normal controls are bypassed and claims are automatically renewed, additional steps be taken to reduce the risk of excess payments occurring.<\/p><p> There were more than 34,500 beneficiaries of the domiciliary care allowance scheme at the end of 2016.  The report notes that no review of scheme claims had taken place since 2012.  It also notes that although a 2013 working group recommended an appropriate control policy and procedures be developed for the schemes, this had not occurred.<\/p><p> On management of social welfare overpayments, where excess payments are identified through control activity, the Department stops or reduces the payment and may, depending on the circumstances of the case, record an overpayment debt for recovery.  Chapter 17 examines the trends in recorded overpayments, as well as the level of legal action related to debt recovery.<\/p><p> The examination found that the introduction of a new debt recording and accounting system in 2014 has provided the Department with better information about overpayment debt, resulting in improved debt management.<\/p><p> Overpayment debt outstanding at the end of 2016 amounted to &euro;482 million.  New overpayments of &euro;110 million were recorded during the year, and debts previously recorded totalling &euro;11.5 million were cancelled.<\/p><p> The age of debts has a bearing on the likelihood of recovery.  Overpayment recovery in the first year after identification is about 30%, and increases to between 50% and 60% after three to four years.  At the end of 2016, almost half of the outstanding debt was over five years old, while almost a quarter was over ten years old.<\/p><p> The amounts due for recovery vary very significantly.  Some 36,000 debts were less than &euro;100 each.  These were either small debts recorded in the first instance, or the residue of debts the bulk of which have been recovered.  At the other end of the scale, over 1,100 debts each in excess of &euro;50,000 accounted for a total of &euro;90 million due.  Those large cases are being managed by the Department's central debt unit.  I understand that, as a result of additional resources being assigned, debts of &euro;30,000 or more will in future be managed by the unit.<\/p><p> Whether an overpayments debtor remains in receipt of a welfare payment also has a bearing on the recoverability of a debt.  About one third of debtors were in receipt of a welfare payment at the end of 2016.  Half of these were actively repaying their debt in instalments, through deductions from their current welfare entitlements.  The remaining two thirds of debtors were no longer in receipt of a welfare payment and just 8% of these were actively repaying their debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Harkness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harkness.

These developments marked a shift in the attitude to the provision of welfare &ndash; from seeing welfare as being restricted to the relief of extreme destitution to seeing it as an essential component needed to sustain modern society; a recognition that market economies only attribute value to those who can contribute to production and that a mechanism is required to share the gains from economic activity with those who cannot contribute, either due to infirmity or illness, because they do not have an opportunity to contribute due to the vagaries of the economic cycle and, as the welfare system developed, to recognise the value of non-market activity such as caring and home making.<\/p> <p>  In the years that followed, the remit of welfare was extended beyond the provision of limited pensions and what was then called \"outdoor relief\" to encompass invalidity and disability payments, payments to carers and lone parents, payments to new mothers on maternity leave, payments to people with families in low-wage occupations and payments to support people take up education, as well as payments to encourage employers to recruit disadvantaged jobseekers, including people with disabilities.  In total, the Department now provides more than 70 separate schemes supporting over 2 million of our citizens.  There is no one in the State who at some time or other will not be a recipient of the Department's services.  The inherent linkage between the welfare system and the labour market is also reflected in the scope of the Department being widened, as in other countries, to encompass the provision of employment services and the development of employment legislation.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the real value of welfare payments has also increased dramatically over the years.  It may interest members to note that in the late 1940s, unemployed male workers could receive 22s 6d per week, while the weekly rate of pension was 17s 6d.  If these are adjusted for inflation, the equivalent rate of payment for unemployed males today would be about &euro;40 and for pensioners about &euro;33.  Today's payment rates far exceed these values at &euro;198 and &euro;238, respectively, and the Irish welfare system, when called upon during the recession years, performed much better in reducing poverty and inequality than welfare systems in other countries.  Arguably, although this will be a question for future generations of economists, the welfare system played the key role in not just stabilising the economy but in positioning it to recover more quickly than might otherwise have been expected.<\/p> <p>  Whatever about the macroeconomic impact of our welfare system, staff of the Department are acutely aware, through their everyday work, of the impact of welfare at the micro level &ndash; the level of individual citizen and families.  They know that the services we provide enable our clients to sustain some level of dignity, often during very difficult periods in their lives.  Therefore, while our staff are conscious that they are distributing funds provided by taxpayers and social insurance contributors and that they have a duty to protect these funds from fraud and error, they are equally, if not more, mindful of the vulnerability of the people who rely on our services.  They strive, therefore, to deliver these services in a manner that removes any sense of stigma that may have been formerly associated with seeking welfare payments.  No one should be embarrassed to enter any of our offices nor should they fear what they may find there or be concerned that they will be treated with undue suspicion.  We work to treat every person with dignity and respect and to make our offices bright and welcoming.  I am pleased to say that research into customer experience of our services indicates that while there will always be individual examples of failure, customers overall are highly satisfied with the service they receive &ndash; scoring our service at an average of over four on a scale of zero to five.<\/p> <p>  I mention all of this because in designing and managing large-scale service processes, a balance has to be struck between building a service that is reliable, efficient and effective for the overwhelming majority of our customers who are open and honest in their dealings with the Department and imposing controls and checks that are intended to reduce fraud and error when the evidence is that levels of fraud and error are relatively low.  We cannot and will not pursue the elimination of error or fraud at the cost of denying entitlement to service or frustrating access to that entitlement.  It is this balance that is at the heart of the three chapters selected for discussion today.<\/p> <p>  The first chapter, Chapter 16, summarises the results of 13 fraud and error surveys conducted by the Department over the past five years or so, covering approximately 70% of the Department's expenditure.  These surveys are used to help identify the risk factors that give rise to fraud and error and to inform changes that help reduce the level of fraud and error into the future.  The surveys also provide an indicative estimate of the level of fraud and error in the system.  In general, for most schemes surveyed this ranges between 0.5% and 5%, with farm assist being a notable outlier at 10.4%.  Across all 13 schemes, the net level of fraud and error averaged about 2%, a level that the Comptroller and Auditor General assesses to be material.  However, I would draw attention to the fact that this rate stands comparison with equivalent rates in social welfare administrations in other states, for example, 1.9% in the United Kingdom, 5% in Israel and 3.5% in Canada, and indeed, to rates of bad debt, which are typically 2% to 5%, and shrinkage, typically 2%, in commercial industry.<\/p> <p>  The second chapter, Chapter 17, reports on the findings of an audit of overpayments conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General and makes six recommendations as to how the Department can improve its performance.  As Accounting Officer, I accept all six recommendations and have already initiated steps to give effect to them, including the assignment of additional staff to control activity in the pensions area and to the central debt recovery unit.  Additional staff have also been assigned to our accounts division to implement a process of monthly reconciliations between our general ledger and debt recovery systems.  Finally, a review of outstanding debt has been completed and I will shortly submit a proposal to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with respect to the prioritisation of our debt recovery activity, including a proposal for a structured write-off or write-down of a stock of very aged debt.<\/p> <p>  The third chapter, Chapter 18, examines the Department's performance in implementing control reviews.  The Department undertakes approximately 950,000 reviews of claims each year to determine if the claim is still valid and if the payment amount is correct.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General makes three recommendations as to how these reviews can be improved including increasing the number of medical reviews, ensuring that a review status is assigned to all medical claims, and taking steps to reduce the risk associated with automatic claim renewal.<\/p><p>As Accounting Officer, I agree with these recommendations and have taken steps to implement them.  I have authorised the recruitment of additional medical assessors and the profiling of medical claims that do not have a review status has commenced.  Automatic renewal of family income supplement claims was discontinued prior to the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.<br\/><br\/>As regards appeals, as members are aware, all decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers and designated persons are appealable to the chief appeals officer.  In any year, approximately 85% of claims are awarded and just 1% of decisions are appealed, of which approximately 60% have a favourable outcome.  In other words, 0.6% of all claim decisions are revised when appealed.  It should also be noted that in 40% of claims that are revised, the decision is made prior to a formal appeal assessment, typically because additional information submitted by the appellant at the appeal stage is provided to the deciding officer who, taking that information into account, revises his or her original decision.  The trend of additional information being provided at appeal stage is particularly prevalent in medical schemes.<br\/><br\/>I am aware that some members have concerns that the timeframe to finalise an appeal is inordinately long.  However, it must be noted that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process.  Appeals officers are required to decide all appeals on a <i>de novo <\/i>basis having provided both the appellant and the Department with an opportunity to make submissions.  Appeals decisions are subject to review by the higher courts and must be formally written to quasi-judicial standards, which is time-consuming.  In order to mitigate time delays, appellants generally have access to welfare payments throughout the appeals process and any decisions made in their favour are backdated to the original claim date to ensure the claimant is not disadvantaged in monetary terms.<br\/><br\/>I wish to conclude by referring back to the challenge of achieving a balance between control and service in a large-scale operations environment.  To give members a sense of scale, it is worthwhile noting that while we sit here this morning the 6,500 staff of the Department will host 430 one-to-one activation meetings with jobseekers, process 26,000 applications for welfare payments, make 118,000 payments to a value of some &euro;28 million, answer 10,000 phone calls, finalise 1,600 control reviews, complete 1,200 standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, registrations and register 45 marriages, including two same-sex marriages.  In addition, departmental staff will be working to progress three significant legislative items involving pension entitlements, employment rights and welfare payments.<br\/><br\/>Given the scale and scope of the Department&rsquo;s operations, it is inevitable that there will be individual lapses by members of staff, that complex business processes will fail from time to time, that some processes will not keep pace with the level of change and, regrettably, that a very small minority of people will manage to defraud the system.  I say that not in an attempt to diminish the issue of fraud and error but to highlight that the issue must be considered in the round.  I believe and hope the members of the committee will agree that, when taken in the round, the staff of the Department do an extraordinarily good job of delivering a very broad and complex set of services in a manner that achieves an appropriate balance between the necessity to minimise loss to fraud and error while delivering on the even greater necessity to deliver an effective and responsive service to their clients.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeon for his opening statement.

Mr. McKeon stated, as has the Taoiseach, how the Department affects so many lives and that no one will go untouched by interaction with the Department from birth to work to old age and death.

The surveys are carried out at a particular point in time.<\/p><p>If one were to calculate a 95% confidence interval, which we have started doing in our fraud and error reports, as the Comptroller and Auditor General knows, the rate of fraud and error for invalidity pension, for example - Deputy Cassells also mentioned other schemes - would be somewhere between 0% and 3%.  The average at that 95% is 1.5%.  However, when one has that range, one cannot extrapolate that it is, even at the net level, that high, so I would be cautious about quoting large figures as being the real cost.  When it comes down to it, if we were to review every single claim all of the time, my belief is we would be closer to the lower boundary of that 95% level, closer to 0% than to 3%, so we must be careful about that.<\/p><p> Having said that, Deputy Cassells asked a question about the variability in the fraud and error between the various schemes.  There are two main things that contribute to the variability.  One is whether the scheme is an assistance-based scheme or a contributions-based scheme.  In assistance-based schemes the payments are contingent on and subject to the income a person might have, so there is an extra variable, whereas contributions-based schemes are based on the historical level of contributions.  One can establish the historical level of contributions at the point of play very precisely.  Therefore, the person qualifies and it is very unlikely that there will subsequently be a change in their entitlement.  After having submitted a means assessment, a person's income may change during the course of his or her claim.  If that income change is not notified to us, it will result in either a fraud or an error.  In most cases we attribute this to error because there is no definitive evidence that the claimant deliberately withheld the information.  The standard in section 302 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act is very high in this regard.  In order to attribute something to fraud, it has to be wilful, deliberate and knowingly withheld information, so it is in fact almost beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, in most cases we attribute it to customer negligence or customer error, and they are the main distinctions.<\/p><p> Deputy Cassells raised a question about the medical reviews.  As outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we have not conducted all the reviews at a time that the medical assessor, when he or she assesses a claim in the case, might be relevant.  It is important to note two things in this regard.  First, the indication that is given by a medical assessor at a point in time when a medical claim is submitted is one of the indicators that we take in order to review and select a claim for review.  There are other indicators relating to the age of the person, the duration of the claim and the prior claim history, so there are a number of triggers which inform our decision to take a claim for review.  One of them is the medical assessor's review.  The fact that a medical assessor says he or she thinks a certain claim should be reviewed in one year, two years or three years does not necessarily mean that that claim will be prioritised for review above another claim, which might have another trigger, such as the age of the individual or his or her prior claim-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>On that, does Mr. McKeon accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General says?  It was very pointed.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>The examination noted that medical control reviews of medically based claims are not being carried out as planned.

The plan is to select claims for review based on a number of risk factors, one of which is the medical assessor's review.  It is not the determining factor.  It is a very important determining factor but it is not the only one.  Furthermore, regarding the medical reviews, we have come through a period in the Department when the rate of new claims for medical schemes has increased very dramatically year on year.  This can be seen in our expenditure results.  As I said in my opening statement, when we have a choice to make between allocating resources to control activity and serving the customer in trying to get his or her claim into payment as early as possible, we generally put the resources into serving the customer.  This meant that we did not have all the resources that we could deploy to do reviews.  Medical schemes are among the least risky when one looks at the figures, so I think this is the right thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I am just pursuing this because Mr. McKeon has said that most of the overpayments are attributable to claimant errors rather than fraud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G00400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Then it is a matter of trying to extrapolate, first, what this is based on and, second, if there are no proper reviews in place, how the Department can make a determination that there is fraudulent behaviour.

The law is very clear that we must be absolutely certain before we pursue a case for fraud that the customer deliberately, knowingly and wilfully withheld the information.  It is important also to understand from a customer perspective that the schemes are very complex.  Many of our schemes have complex rules and conditions and many customers genuinely would not be aware, if their means change, what the extent of the change needs to be before they need to tell us.  In the Department we have a job to do in informing and communicating to customers that if their means change they need to tell us.<\/p> <p>  I noted in my opening statement that there was a particularly high level of fraud and error in respect of farm assist.  We are looking at a small number of farmers; I think 6,000 to 7,000 farmers, there or thereabouts, claim farm assist.  They are small farmers.  Their income is very variable.  Because it is their net income, it depends on input prices and output prices.  Their income varies a lot over the year.  It is understandable that in that situation a farmer facing such variability in income would have difficulties in figuring out whether this means he or she needs to have a change in his or her payment or not, particularly during the years in question where there were significant changes to the single farm payment and where the Department's means rules were changed.  Instead of 70% of farm income being assessable, it was changed during the period of this review to 100%.  Unless farmers are reading the newspapers and watching the D&aacute;il debates very carefully, they will not necessarily have copped that it is not 70% any more but 100%.  These are the factors that have to be taken account and which we have to understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Can Mr. McKeon explain the variation in the overpayments in respect of disability allowance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G01000","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>The variability-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G01200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy is talking about the gross figure, that is, the 18.4%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#G01400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Of that growth, 15.3% of those claims were found to be ineligible on first review.  When we did a fraud and error survey, all of those clients appealed to the appeals office that determination, and 15.3% succeeded at appeal.  That is the figure before an appeal is taken into account, so that actually brought the net level down very significantly.  I think the criteria for disability allowance is that a person must be substantially restricted in their ability to perform work which is suitable to their employment experience and education.  That is a subjective assessment.  We have very good medical assessors who are trained in occupational medicine.  They reach a determination based on the evidence presented to them and the client is found to be ineligible.  Often - and I referred to this in my opening statement - what then happens is that the client goes away to his or her consultant or doctor and gets additional evidence.  If our medical assessor did not have that at the first review, it is reasonable then that when additional information becomes available, it would be reviewed either by the medical assessor or the appeals office and the decision should be reversed.  That is a difficulty.  We are working with various stakeholder groups in the illness and disability space to try to encourage them to get their clients to submit as much medical information at first claim.  I do not want to give details on this, but, anecdotally, one or two of the stakeholder groups have made us aware that they almost advise their clients to hold back some information and keep it for the appeal.  This just creates a situation whereby we are saying no at first appeal, and we need to fix that.

We match the deaths register as well.  We match and take note and automatically stop payment at the appropriate time when a death is registered.  Most of the difficulty on the non-contributory pension scheme relates to two categories - means and when means change, and savings are part of the means.  The savings ratio among pensions is very high.  As they accumulate savings, according to the law they lose entitlement to some payments because their savings are assessed.  Many pensioners neglect to tell us that.  Many pensioners have earnings that they do not tell us about.  In fact what happens is not so much that people are claiming for deceased members of the family, it is that when a person dies and we get details of their estate we find that while they were alive they had savings or means that they had not disclosed and it is a recovery from the estate of the deceased rather than a recovery from a person who is claiming.  There are cases of impersonation on pensions and they tend to be slightly higher but that is generally in respect of people who are not living in the country.  A family member claiming in respect of a person who has emigrated could be claiming in their name with their PPSN.  There have been a number of notable examples that we have prosecuted through the courts.  Regrettably many of our higher value cases are older people who are defrauding the pension system.

The only campaign that got a lot of attention was the fraud campaign.  It goes back to the point I was making, taking something that the Department is correct in doing, but which can trigger a headline that sensationalises it.  When one thinks about a communication campaign on the issue of fraud and control, there are three objectives and three audiences that one is targeting.  The first objective is to notify and inform and that gets to the point of people being aware that when their circumstances change and their means increases or their savings increase, they should inform the Department.  If one looks at the text of the campaigns, and most of the communication, that was the main point.  The second audience is people who might be thinking of defrauding the system and the objective is to deter them.  We are saying to people that the Department is on top of the fraud issue, that if people try to defraud the system we will catch them and there will be consequences.  That is a good and wholesome thing to do.  The third element to the campaign is to assure the public.  A large part of our audience - and this is sometimes forgotten when we talk about welfare and I referred in my opening statement about staff being aware of their responsibility to contributors and taxpayers - are the people who fund the system and we need to give them an assurance that the Department is not ignoring fraud or that we are not soft on fraud.

We have to be clear that it would stand up if the client appealed to the Ombudsman.  It can arise that a client would walk into one of our Intreo centres and tell a member of staff that his or her means have changed, but the claim might refer to disability allowance which is dealt with in Longford.  There can be delays in getting that information from an office in the country to Longford.  Those delays should not happen.  I acknowledge that they are process failure but, given the scale of our operations, they do happen.  In those kinds of situations, even if there is an overpayment, it would be wrong of us to go after the client.  I do not think the Ombudsman or the courts would support us if we did.  We would be saying that we were told in week 10 about a change in means but that it took us until week 20 to do anything about it.  Ergo, we cannot do anything about week 10 to week 20 because we knew it for ten weeks without doing anything.  It is in those situations that we would write off the debt.<\/p><p> The other issue concerns estate cases.  Most of the write-offs in the year related to estate cases.

In terms of why someone might think it worthwhile, this goes back to a point raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is pure speculation, however, and we have not carried out research into it.  We were reviewing domiciliary care allowance cases up to 2011 to 2012 and we stopped doing the reviews at that stage because, on review, approximately 40% of clients were found to be ineligible.  Subsequently, they would appeal and it somehow got into the ether that an appeal decision is better than a first decision.  I think that people in some areas are focusing on the appeal as the real decision point.  This does not make sense and we are doing our best with stakeholder groups to get out the message that if they give us the same information at the first play as they do at appeal they will get the same decision.

They are being called for appointments with JobPath at times when they are working.  There is no flexibility in the system which seems to be daft.

In the case of an application by a person whose condition is not going to improve, why is there a need to continuously review the application?  In other words, if a person has a condition such as Down's syndrome, spina bifida or is wheelchair bound, on what basis is the view adopted that the condition will improve?

In all of those cases, there were people available who were either on the live register or long-term unemployed and who could have been referred to the community employment base.  When we tease it out, the difficulty is that we probably need to have a different model of engagement between the people on our long-term unemployed register and the community employment companies in order to get more of the people who are not currently aware of or applying for community employment schemes to apply.<\/p> <p>  One can contrast it with T&uacute;s, for example, which is a very similar scheme.  However, the difference with T&uacute;s is that people are selected by the Department and referred to community employment.  Conversely, community employment sponsors advertise their positions and then wait for applicants.  This falls to the Department and it is something at which we are looking.  We need to be a little bit more active in talking to the 40,000 people who are long-term unemployed and not on any other schemes at the moment and telling them that the vacancies are there and encouraging them to apply.<\/p> <p>  There is another difficulty, which is a little bit difficult to say because it runs against my own personal grain a bit but, nevertheless, I think there is evidence for it.  For community employment businesses, or certainly the one or two cases I looked at when I scratched beneath the surface, the problem was not so much that they could not get people.

Obviously, we cannot begin to put a price on the value of what carers are doing at home, most of them at breaking point, out of love for the person they are caring for.  On the other hand, we have the nursing homes support scheme, the fair deal scheme, which I call the \"unfair deal\" scheme, but let us stick to the terminology.  The fair deal scheme covers approximately 23,000 people and the cost for it this year is &euro;970 million.  We have now reached a cost of &euro;1 billion.  It obviously makes sense for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to immediately and urgently look at this matter.  Some 23,000 people are in care at a cost of almost &euro;1 billion, and then 65,740 people are struggling, under a pittance, and saving the State a fortune.

It seems to be a case of \"Here we go again\".<\/p> <p>  I want Mr. McKeon to define what he calls fraud.  I would have thought fraud was a criminal offence, but the only person who can call it that is a judge.  He has used phrases which no public servant has the right to use.  He referred to customer fraud, looking at a document and customer error.  He gave us a definition of the Act and there are three subsections relating to fraud stating that it has to be wilful.  For Mr. McKeon to come to a conclusion that fraud has taken place, he has to be in the mind of the person concerned to know whether what happened was wilful.  He used the word earlier and we know it is in the system.  <\/p> <p>  The only person who can come to a conclusion in regard to the establishment of fraud which is criminal is a judge.  I respectfully suggest that nobody in the Department has the right to use that phrase.  They might believe something is a suspected fraud.  As a layman, I believe only a judge can decide whether something is fraud.  <\/p> <p>  Reference was made to error.  We will separate the issues.  It gives everything a bad name.  I want to compliment the tone of Mr. McKeon's opening remark and his understanding for the people he deals with on an ongoing basis in terms of making sure they are all right.  It is possible that 2% of people are making claims for payments to which they are not fully entitled.  This is a result of a variety of issues, including fraud, error on the part of the Department or a death following which it takes a number of weeks for a payment to the person to cease in the system.  There is usually a clawback against the estate of the deceased.  Some errors may take place because people did not telephone the Department on the day their mother died to advise it to stop payment.  These things can take time.<\/p> <p>  I want Mr. McKeon to talk to me about the word \"fraud\".  It is great for some people to categorise other people in receipt of social welfare as engaging in fraud.  That probably does happen sometimes.  I ask Mr. McKeon to talk to me about his use of the word \"fraud\" and what I would call suspected fraud.  The relevant Act referred to contains the term \"wilful\".  How can one read people's minds, come to a conclusion and categorise what has happened as fraud?  I would like Mr. McKeon to change his language.  I am upfront.

The figures will not change, but the title may well change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#Y00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Okay.  I think Mr. McKeon takes the point that these things are suspected fraud until such time as they are proven.<\/p> <p>  I refer to page 234 of the report.  Mr. McKeon does not need to go into it in detail.  There are 131,000 people out of 191,000 people who owe some money, and 36,000 owe less than &euro;100.  Will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agree to some common sense and not waste everybody's time?  Somebody might have over-claimed one day four years ago.  If the amounts are under &euro;100, why are we wasting valuable resources dealing with the issue?<\/p> <p>  There are 69,000 people who owe amounts between &euro;100 and &euro;500.  That is probably due to a week between changing jobs or something like that, but they are listed under a heading.  Another 27,000 people owe amounts under &euro;1,000.  I am not suggesting the Department go soft on that.  Perhaps I should not use the term \"trivial\", but I could not understand how we spent money, time and resources on dealing with these types of issues.  I bet if I asked for the ages of some of those cases, I would be told some were over ten years old.  We are the Committee of Public Accounts and we do not like writing off taxpayers' money, but when we get figures we want them to have practical meaning.  I do not think counting some of the cases as debts which are collectable is correct.  I ask the Department to take that on board.  I know the witnesses will probably say they are coming to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with further proposals on that during the course of the year.  I hope common sense will prevail.<\/p> <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question on a matter with which Mr. McKeon might be familiar.  On 18 October, I asked for the details of the social insurance fund by scheme.  I was told there were 30,731 cases relating to jobseeker's benefit, the outstanding debt was &euro;23 million and the average debt was &euro;754.  Obviously, some of that relates to people who claimed an extra day or two here and there or whatever.  That figure seems quite low.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. McKeon probably has the response to the parliamentary question because I am sure he cleared it.  I do not understand why the highest average debt per scheme is deserted wives' benefit, at &euro;18,000 according to the reply.  In the case of the contributory guardian payment the average debt is &euro;9,000.<\/p><p>Will Mr. McKeon comment on the average debt figure under the death benefit scheme, which seems to be very high?  I am not familiar with it but I understand there are only a small number of cases under the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#Y01000","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":770,"content":"<p>The death benefit scheme comes under occupational injuries.

The reality, however, is that of the 190,000 people who owe the Department money, most do not owe very much at all.<\/p> <p>  Another issue of concern to me is that the application forms which go out from the Department, for carer's benefit or allowance, disability benefit and so on, are heavily geared to people with a physical disability.  There is only one reference to mental health on the forms but lots of questions about whether the applicant can bend, walk up and down the stairs, lift objects and so on.  In this day and age, the documentation is not adequately reflective of mental health issues.  Of all the people in the country dealing with health difficulties, a certain number will have mental rather than physical challenges.  It is very difficult for such people, including those who may potentially be suicidal, to set out their case properly via the existing forms.  In the case of carer's benefit, for example, a person might look physically okay and can walk up and down the stairs but will need constant watching in case he or she walks out the door and in front of a car or tries to jump through a top window.  The forms do not reflect the space mental health issues occupy in people's lives, with only one relevant line out of 15 or 20 categories.  The Department seems to be talking to its service users all the time.  Is there any feedback from them on this issue?  Many of the people coming to me seeking help are suffering from serious depression and other mental health problems.  It is not easy for those people to fill out the forms in a way that reflects their difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#Z00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":772,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked about write-offs.

In the case of the one-parent family payment, for instance, the average sum owed in instances of suspected fraud identified this year was &euro;3,300.  It is the case that a handful of egregious cases may skew the average.  There was one listing for more than &euro;200,000 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.

Could the Department send us a report on its assistance?  I know the Department would have had a temporary office in Mountmellick for a few days.  Now we are relying on the social welfare officer to keep the rest of it afloat so could the Department send us a note on that?<\/p> <p>  My last question concerns the Social Insurance Fund - this big amount of money.  I see the Department has submitted the accounts, which were signed off on 26 September 2017.  I come back to the &euro;462 million that is due to the Social Insurance Fund under the redundancy and insolvency payments scheme.  It is on page 13 of the audited accounts.  The witnesses do not need to go through it because they know the figures.  This issue was raised when Mr. McKeon's predecessor was here last year.  I am looking at note three at the top of page 14, which says that it is envisaged that in the order of 90% of the value will eventually be written off since the majority of the debt refers to the insolvent companies and that the balance is not recognised as an asset in the Social Insurance Fund balance sheet.  I understand that.  That figure of &euro;462 million is still there.  The Department signed that.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said that 90% of it might eventually be written off.  Could the witnesses look at that?  This topic was raised here 12 months ago when Mr. McKeon's predecessor was before the committee.  We got a letter from Mr. McKeon's predecessor dated 6 April 2017 giving details of the companies that owed the debt and those that were in receivership, liquidation, dissolved, struck off or normal.  We continue to pursue that.  I have done so through parliamentary questions at various stages.  In May 2017, the Department gave a breakdown to a parliamentary question of mine that said that &euro;230 million of that was for cases involving less than &euro;10,000, &euro;120 million for cases involving between &euro;10,000 and &euro;50,000 and &euro;90 million for cases involving individual employers.  I am not saying they are there.  What is recorded is that of the figure of &euro;462 million, &euro;90 million was for amounts over &euro;50,000 and one of those amounts involved an amount greater than &euro;10 million so some company somewhere along the line owes the fund &euro;10 million.  I have no idea if that company is long gone or whether it is back in a new incarnation.  They are the figures given in a reply to my parliamentary question on 23 May 2017.  One company owed &euro;10 million.  There should be clarity on this.  It was then asked what liaison existed between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners regarding how many of these companies are still trading.  There was a reply to a parliamentary question of mine on 17 October 2017, with which I am sure the witnesses are quite familiar because it is quite recent and they have seen me following this topic since the last meeting.  At that meeting, the breakdown by employer with a trading status deemed normal by the Companies Registration Office was given.  These are the Department's figures in the reply to the parliamentary question involving normal companies and the Companies Registration Office.  Not all these companies have gone away.  Possibly most of them have but there are 3,453 with a debt of &euro;72,235,000.  The reply to the parliamentary question states that the Department deems their trading status as normal.  I do not understand why if their trading status is normal, why the Department is not chasing that &euro;72 million.  Some of these businesses may not have been incorporated companies.  The Department gave a breakdown per employer of non-registered companies primarily sole traders who were involved in this.  There are 4,093 of them with a debt due to the fund of &euro;41.550 million.  I still do not understand why the Department has not followed that.  We asked what arrangements the Department had with Revenue to follow that up.  A memorandum of understanding, co-operation and mutual assistance between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners was signed by Mr. McKeon's predecessor and the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners on 27 February 2017.  Page six of that agreement, which I sourced through a parliamentary question, talks about governance of this agreement.  If the figure of &euro;462 million is not real, give us the real figure.  The Department says 90% of it could eventually be written off.<\/p><p>The figure for the companies and sole traders considered to be engaged in normal trading might be much less than 90%.  We firmly do not believe an adequate effort has been made.  It stems from the old Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Employment.  The witnesses probably feel this was not their debt originally, but nobody in the public service seems to be getting to the bottom of the figure.  It is important that we do in order to have a real figure.  <br\/><br\/>On page 6 of the memorandum of understanding the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has signed with the Revenue Commissioners, under the heading of governance, it is stated: <\/p><blockquote>The implementation of this memorandum, and any strategic or policy issues arising, will be kept under review by the high level group, as will proposals for this memorandum to be modified or extended.  Meetings of the high level group will be held quarterly or, exceptionally, at anytime at the request of the either party.  <\/blockquote><p>The memorandum of understanding was signed in February and there should have been at least two quarterly meetings on it.  Mr. McKeon can brief us, but I am quite happy for him to send us the minutes of those meetings and to indicate the progress made.  They can be forwarded to the secretariat, as I do not need to delay him.  Let us come to a conclusion on this issue.  The majority of it is probably a phantom figure.  If there are good reasons it is not the real figure, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will have to be given a detailed memorandum to enable it to consider whether it is appropriate to make changes as it is hanging there year in and year out.  In the interests of clarity, I hope we can get to the bottom of the figure.  I am happy, therefore, for the information to be forwarded to the secretariat.  Would Mr. McKeon like to say anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017120700002#AA03100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":821,"content":"<p>The committee is obviously very familiar with the issue.

My office provides a free service for consumers to resolve complaints about their financial service provider.  Our goal is to redress the balance of power between the individual consumer and provider.  We do this by making our service as informal and accessible as possible.  We mediate between the parties and, where necessary, investigate and issue legally binding findings.<\/p> <p>  The office has been dealing with tracker mortgage complaints since 2009.  To date, we have received 1,838 complaints, in respect of 683 of which findings have issued.  Of these, 115, or 17%, were upheld; 59, or 9%, were partly upheld; while 509, or 74%, were not upheld.  A number of the findings directed financial service providers to restore tracker mortgages to complainants.  In addition, 311 complaints about tracker mortgage interest rates have been resolved through the acceptance of settlement offers made by financial service providers after engagement with the office.<\/p> <p>  We have 540 open tracker mortgage complaints.  The remaining 304 were either out of jurisdiction or withdrawn.  However, as a result of the recent legislative changes made by the Oireachtas, some of these complaints may now come within my jurisdiction and in those circumstances we are ready to accept complaints from consumers.<\/p> <p>  PTSB appealed four of the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s 2011 decisions to the High Court.  The decisions had directed the bank to return customers to their tracker mortgages.  They were linked and dealt with by Mr. Justice Hogan in a single High Court case.  He delivered his decision in August 2012, one year after the FSO decisions had been issued.  He affirmed two of the four decisions and remitted the other two to the FSO for further consideration.  PTSB appealed the two cases that had been affirmed by the High Court to the Supreme Court.  While the appeals were ongoing, for one year in the High Court and over two further years in the Supreme Court, all PTSB tracker mortgage complaints were put on hold by the FSO.  The office kept in regular contact with the complainants while their complaints were on hold.  In February 2015, almost four years after the original FSO decisions, PTSB withdrew its Supreme Court appeal which had been listed for hearing some days later.  By February 2015 the Central Bank had commenced an enforcement investigation action with PTSB and the PTSB tracker mortgage redress programme was put in place.<\/p> <p>  Shortly after I took office in April 2015, it became evident to me that the loss of tracker mortgages for certain people who had wrongly been denied tracker mortgages had the potential to cause serious hardship for them.  It was also clear to me that the FSO would have a key role in solving the problem, both for individual borrowers who would bring complaints to the office and larger groups of borrowers through co-operation with the Central Bank of Ireland.  Because of this, I have invested considerable time and resources in the past two years in assembling the data available within the my office on tracker mortgage complaints and working in close co-operation with the Central Bank to ensure consumers wrongly denied tracker mortgages would have them returned in the most efficient and effective way possible.  I was aware that my office had built up a considerable body of information on tracker mortgages.  However, this information was contained in hundreds of individual complaint files.  Realising how valuable the information contained in these files could be, I decided to undertake an analysis of tracker mortgage complaints decided by the office between 2009 and July 2015.  The aim of the analysis which considered 437 files in which findings had issued during that period was initially to inform me of the issues concerned.  However, it became evident at an early stage of the analysis that the information would also be useful to the Central Bank in its broader regulatory and enforcement role.  For that reason, I engaged with it to establish what information would be of assistance to it.  As a result of this interaction, the objective of my analysis was broadened in order to inform the Central Bank of the various issues the FSO had encountered in dealing with tracker mortgage complaints.<\/p> <p>  I worked in close co-operation with the Central Bank, in line with the memorandum of understanding in place with it, and presented the findings of my analysis to it in November 2015.  I believe the information was of assistance to it in scoping its current industry-wide examination of tracker mortgage related issues which it directed lenders to complete.  The information gleaned from the analysis which was provided for the Central Bank included the following: the various triggers which had caused complainants to transfer from or lose their tracker interest rates; the various reasons provided by the financial service providers for the failure or refusal to allow the complainants to move or revert to a tracker interest rate; details of the instructions signed by complainants on transferring between rates; the various contractual conditions relied on by the financial service providers; and details of relevant conditions included in loan offer letters.  The objective of the examination directed by the Central Bank is to ensure lenders conduct a complete review of their mortgage loan books to assess compliance with both contractual and regulatory requirements relating to tracker mortgages.  In situations where customer detriment is identified from the examination, banks are expected to provide appropriate redress and compensation in line with the Central Bank's principles for redress in order to ensure fair outcomes for customers of those lenders.<\/p> <p>  In the initial stages of the examination I became aware that some banks had indicated that they would not include customers who had received decisions from the FSO in the examination.  I was firmly of the view - a view shared by the Central Bank - that no mortgage holder who had made a complaint to my office should be treated any differently in the examination by virtue of having made such a complaint, irrespective of the outcome.  I wrote to the CEO of each of the banks informing them of my view and asking them to confirm that no mortgage holder who had made a complaint to my office would be treated any differently in the examination by virtue of having made a complaint to the FSO, irrespective of the outcome.<\/p><p>I received this commitment in writing from all the banks.  It is my view that the most effective and efficient way to provide redress and compensation to borrowers who have been wrongly denied tracker mortgages is for the banks to co-operate fully with the Central Bank examination.  For this reason, I have communicated with each complainant who currently has a tracker mortgage complaint with this office explaining why I believe that it is in their best interest to put their complaint on hold with this office pending the outcome of the examination currently being undertaken.  I have worked closely with the Central Bank throughout the examination process and I will continue to work in close co-operation with it to achieve the best outcome for those wrongly denied tracker mortgages.  I have carefully considered the Central Bank's October report regarding the progress of the examination.  I am particularly conscious of its concern that some lenders have failed to identify impacted customers or failed to recognise that certain customers have been impacted by their failures.<br\/><br\/>When the various financial service providers have completed the Central Bank examination in respect of individual borrowers, if there are people who believe that their bank has not provided the redress and compensation that they believe they are entitled to, they can make a complaint to my office.  This option may also be available, in certain circumstances, to people who have made a complaint to us in the past.  The service is free and individual consumers do not require legal representation to use our service.  We stand ready and able to take these complaints and we will look at each complaint on its individual merits and consider the person&rsquo;s unique circumstances.  <br\/><br\/>As soon as the various financial service providers complete the examination in respect of certain customers or groups of customers who have tracker-related complaints in my office, we will communicate with those complainants.  Where complainants inform us that they have agreed a settlement with their financial service provider, we will close the file.  Where complainants are not satisfied with an offer of redress from their financial service provider or do not receive any offer from their financial service provider, the mediation, resolution, investigation and adjudication processes of this office will be available to them.  Complaints may include that the complainant did not receive a tracker rate of interest and still believe they are entitled to one, that they received a tracker rate of interest but believe the wrong margin has been applied, that they received a tracker rate of interest but believe it has been applied from the wrong date and that they believe they were not treated fairly or reasonably during the examination or appeals process.  I am conscious that many of the people who have wrongly been denied tracker mortgages have been waiting a considerable length of time and may have suffered considerable hardship.  For this reason, we will prioritise tracker related complaints as soon as the examination directed by the Central Bank is complete in respect of individual borrowers and groups of borrowers.  We have put in place a dedicated tracker team with a dedicated telephone number 01 587 7077 and email - <i>tracker@fspo.ie<\/i>- to deal with people who have tracker-related enquiries and to progress tracker-related complaints.  <br\/><br\/>I assure members that together with my management team and staff, I will continue to work closely with the Central Bank regarding tracker mortgages.  I take this opportunity to outline our services and some of the significant powers available to me to assist in this regard.  As I have pointed out, our objective is to redress the balance between an individual and their financial service provider.  Our service is free to consumers and we have been making significant changes over the past two years to make the service more accessible and easier for consumers to use.  We now have an informal mediation service which gives consumers the chance to be listened to and have their complaint resolved in a faster and less legalistic way.  Where that does not work, we formally investigate and seek responses from the financial service provider and we thoroughly consider all of the evidence surrounding the complaint before delivering a fair and impartial decision.  <br\/><br\/>In July of this year, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Act 2017 was enacted.  This legislation extended the period within which consumers of long-term financial service products can take complaints to my office.  This will allow some complainants to submit complaints to this office, including some with tracker-related complaints, which may previously have been time barred under the six-year rule.  The Houses of Oireachtas have also provided me with powers that are different from the courts.  I can direct compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and I can also direct rectification, which could, for example, involve directing a financial service provider to reinstate a tracker mortgage rate or direct it to change the margin or the time from which a particular rate was applied.  The legislation also provides that my decisions are appealable by way of a statutory appeal to the High Court, which means that it is my office which defends the case if a financial service provider appeals my decision to the High Court.  Therefore, consumers who take a complaint to the Ombudsman do not need to worry about any financial risk if their financial service provider appeals my decision to the High Court.  As Financial Services Ombudsman, I also have the power to look beyond the contractual terms and consider the fairness and reasonableness of conduct complained of.  I assure the members that I will not be found wanting in using the powers the Oireachtas has given me, in an impartial manner to ensure a fair outcome in respect of complaints made to my office.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage with it here today.  Ms Cassidy and I are happy now to deal with any questions that arise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for giving us the opportunity to appear before the committee today to speak about the issue of tracker mortgages and the role of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, in the context of consumer protection.

Regardless of the financial crisis, consumers' contracts should have been, and must be, honoured.<\/p> <p>  We believe that the best way for consumers to get redress is through the Central Bank's examination and, if required, as Mr. Deering outlined, through the Financial Services Ombudsman.  As demonstrated by this situation, consumer protection is particularly important in financial services where consumers are extremely vulnerable.   We are happy to share our views today with the committee on these important matters.   <\/p> <p>  We have been before the committee on a couple of occasions with regard to insurance and a report on options for standard variable mortgages so some members know what we do but for completeness, I will provide some detail about our work.  The CCPC, which was established in October 2014, enforces competition and consumer protection legislation in all sectors of the economy so basically, everywhere a consumer buys something, competition and consumer protection legislation applies.  We have 90 staff members all working towards the common purpose of protecting and increasing consumer welfare.  Each year, we receive in excess of 40,000 contacts from consumers and traders.  These contacts enable us to identify systemic breaches of the law across many sectors.  We use general consumer protection legislation and competition law to end illegal business practices.  In our three years of existence, we secured Ireland's first conviction for bid rigging, which is a competition offence, secured the first custodial sentence in a motor vehicle crime; and opened investigations and taken enforcement action across a wide range of sectors, including event ticketing, the bagged cement sector, online hotel bookings, retail and motor garages.  We are currently undertaking a study of the household waste collection market in Ireland.  In addition, we have launched a project on standard term contracts in residential care services for older people and have stopped thousands of unsafe consumer products from entering the Irish market.  That is the big picture regarding what we do across the economy.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to financial services, our primary statutory role with regard to financial services involves education and information.  Informed consumers are a vital component in an active market, particularly given the increasing choice and complexity of financial services products.  As part of its mandate, the CCPC runs numerous public awareness campaigns and has developed specific online tools to help consumers assess their mortgage rate and compare other products, including savings and current accounts.  Our website annually receives over 1.6 million visits and the price comparison tools I have outlined are the most frequently visited pages. <\/p> <p>  In addition to this specific statutory remit, our efforts in the financial services area are particularly focused on where we believe there are gaps in consumer protection, for example, PCP car finance, at which we are looking, or where we believe an external perspective can be helpful to develop policy.  An example here is our mortgage options paper, which we discussed with the committee earlier this year.  With regard to competition enforcement, the committee will also be aware that we have an open investigation into potential price signalling in the insurance sector.  The European Commission also has an open investigation into a different aspect of the sector which the CCPC supported by making our staff available to assist with local searches.  <\/p> <p>  We also operate a consumer help line and through that, receive information from consumers regarding issues they are experiencing across the economy, including financial services.  We share this information with the Central Bank so that it can take further action as necessary.  Out of the 131,000 calls and emails we have received from consumers since we were established, 153 related to the scope of the Central Bank's tracker mortgage examination.  The Financial Services Ombudsman would have received many more contacts of this nature, as would be expected.<\/p><p>As is the case with all consumer contacts we receive relating to financial services, those who contacted us were given information to help them take the next steps to address their problem and the information we obtained through these contacts was provided in summary reports to the Central Bank. <\/p><p> In terms of consumer protection in financial services, the primary objective of consumer protection law is to prevent consumers from being exploited, either in the sales process or by the nature of the product or service that they buy.  There is an important distinction between the CCPC&rsquo;s powers and those of sectoral regulators, both in Ireland and other jurisdictions.  Many sectoral regulators have legislative powers to develop industry-specific rules to prevent issues from occurring.  In other words, they are not going after something that has already happened but are trying to prevent it from occurring in the first place.  Many also have the power to impose fines directly when breaches occur and to compel firms to compensate consumers. <\/p><p> In financial services, consumers are particularly at risk.  Products can be very complex and there is a significant information imbalance between the consumer and the seller and the potential for consumer detriment is high.  This means it is essential that consumers are protected by legislation and regulatory systems that reflect the characteristics of the market.  It is also essential that there is robust enforcement with significant implications for traders who exploit consumers, both in terms of their reputation and financially. <\/p><p> The Central Bank and the CCPC both have powers under the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  In addition to this Act, the Central Bank as the sectoral regulator also has a broad suite of sector-specific legislative powers, which empowers it to introduce codes of conduct, fitness and probity rules and so forth.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s tracker mortgage examination is assessing compliance with the code of practice for credit institutions, the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection code, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Consumer Protection Act.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s ability to compel compensation for consumers, in addition to the presence of the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau, is vital in ensuring that when financial services firms break the rules, consumers are financially compensated.  The Central Bank also has the power to directly fine firms for serious breaches of regulations, a power which the CCPC does not have. <\/p><p> In the context of the Central Bank's tracker mortgages examination, as I have already said, consumers of financial services are vulnerable at the best of times.  However, difficulties with a mortgage can have a devastating effect on families.  We are aware that it has been suggested that banks were operating as part of a cartel and that they agreed together to deny their customers access to tracker mortgages.  Through our relationships with the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Financial Services Ombudsman, we have closely followed the steps being taken and the scope of the Central Bank examination.  There are formal structures between the CCPC and the Central Bank, which compel the Central Bank to inform the CCPC of any information that may indicate a potential breach of competition law.  I can advise the committee that no such report has been made; nor have we uncovered through our own market surveillance any information to allow us to open a criminal investigation.  We cannot stress enough how important it is for any individual who has information of criminal behaviour, including cartel behaviour, to bring this information to us and we will take appropriate action.  Notwithstanding this, there can be no question but that consumers have been badly let down and exploited.  It is conceivable that consumers have been the casualty of opportunistic behaviour within the market as it would appear that each of the banks made a decision that was in their financial interests but which was extremely detrimental to the customers involved.  This form of conduct should not and cannot be tolerated.  What is most concerning is the apparent lack of a culture of compliance, which appears to be deeply ingrained in the financial services industry.  This is despite the radical changes made in the boards and management teams in the post-crisis era.  <\/p><p> Finally, the CCPC firmly believes that for consumers to be adequately protected in this sector, there must be strong legislation, vigorous enforcement and well-informed consumers.  At the end of this process consumers should be fully compensated, providers held to account and measures put in place to ensure that consumers are adequately protected in all financial services products.  We believe the immediate priority must be reimbursing and compensating consumers as quickly as possible.  In this regard, we share the frustrations of many that this process has been slow.  We are particularly disappointed in the lack of concern and slow response from the industry and in the apparent resistance from the lenders reported by the Central Bank.  Compensating consumers should not be the end of the matter.  It is vital that the Central Bank&rsquo;s final report clearly explains exactly what occurred in each financial institution that led to consumers being treated so badly and that appropriate enforcement action is taken to address breaches to ensure accountability and drive a culture of compliance.  Crucially, we believe that this clarity and accountability is essential in ensuring that consumers of financial services are never mistreated in such a manner again. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Thank you Ms Goggin.

It might be something that is reported in the media.  This is particularly the case with regard to an investigation into price signalling.  By its nature, price signalling is out there and is in the public domain.  It is something that can be picked up from media, with people saying there needs to be an increase of X% in this industry over the next year, for example.  If people are acting on that then, it is something that can be picked up through market intelligence and surveillance.  We can pick things up through complaints.<\/p> <p>  In terms of criminal investigations, one is looking at ending up in the Central Criminal Court on a cartel offence and in that context, one's best evidence is informant evidence.  We are talking about an immunity applicant, that is, somebody who was there and who can swear up to what happened, whether meetings were held and whether agreement was reached.  It is somebody who can provide names, locations, dates of meetings and so on.  The problem with that is that if a person has been present at all of those meetings, it is very likely that he or she has also committed a criminal offence.  That is why we have introduced a cartel immunity programme in conjunction with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Under that programme, persons who have been part of a cartel and have engaged in behaviour that could be regarded as criminal can come forward to us, apply for immunity and on the basis that they give us evidence and fully co-operate with the inquiry, we can ask the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, not to prosecute them and to use their evidence in the criminal cartel case.  <\/p> <p>  Next we would look at whistleblower evidence.  By whistleblower, I mean someone who has information but who was not necessarily a part of the cartel.  Again, it is somebody who could give one specific information as to names, dates and exactly what form of behaviour occurred.  That kind if information is what one can use to ground a warrant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":845,"content":"<p>That is general rather than specifically related to this investigation.

The reason I asked is because Ms Goggin said in her opening statement that the CCPC does not have any information to open a criminal investigation.  I presume the CCPC does not have to open a criminal investigation.  It can open one similar to that being undertaken with regard to the insurance industry.  The CCPC is an organisation which is tasked with upholding competition and consumer protection.  It is now undisputed that the 11 financial institutions that were involved in the mortgage market here and involved in the sale of tracker mortgages either took from or denied their customers tracker mortgages or applied the wrong rates.  We know that somewhere in the region of 30,000 customers were affected and that the sum of money involved is up to &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p>Was there no wee suspicion within the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission<b><\/b>that there might be a bit of uncompetitive practice in this regard, given that every single one of them that is involved in any substantial way with the sale of tracker mortgages has done nearly exactly the same thing? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#F01100","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I will first address the criminal versus civil issue.  In the case of a flat-out cartel, that is, a price fixing, market sharing or bid-rigging cartel in which people sat down in a room and said they would get together and make a specific agreement to cheat their customers, we would always regard that as a criminal matter.  The issue with civil cases is there are no fines.  We do not have civil fines in Ireland.  We do not have the power the Central Bank, for example, has to fine entities, which it authorises, because they operate within a regulated sector.  We always regard flat-out cartel activity as being so serious that we want to take the criminal route, we want to get it into the Central Criminal Court and we want fines and penalties on individuals, as well as on the company.  The problem with this is one must be extremely careful about how one gets the evidence.  Without pointing the finger, we have seen what happens when public agencies cut corners in carrying out a criminal investigation.  We are not going there.  We have recruited a serious, professional, criminal investigation division.  We have a serving detective sergeant from the Garda national economic crime bureau.  We have recruited experienced professional investigators from the ranks of retired garda&iacute; and from members of other police forces.  We are going down that route.  In looking to use our search powers, it would mean going before a judge to get a search warrant, where we would need to be able to explain to the judge the reasons for looking for a search warrant for a particular institution for a particular type of behaviour.  We cannot go on a fishing expedition; we would be thrown out of court.  It may be two years down the road but we must think about that.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the behaviour of the banks, it is undoubtedly the case that they all started to withdraw tracker mortgages at the same time.  It is also undoubtedly the case that they were losing their shirts on tracker mortgages, each and every one of them.  During the period when the banks entered into tracker mortgages they assumed they would be able to borrow at or close to the European Central Bank base rate the whole time.  The rate at which the banks were borrowing suddenly switched and they were not able to borrow at that rate any more.  Looking at the situation on an individual basis, it was absolutely in each bank's interest to get people off tracker mortgages.  Unfortunately this is what prompted a lot of what appears to have been highly unscrupulous behaviour.  Without more, however, we cannot search for evidence on the basis that the banks did something that was clearly in their own financial interests to do, and which they had very good reasons to do.  There were bad reasons in how they went about it but to request a grant of a warrant we would need something more than the fact that each bank did something in their own economic interest at that point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I know my colleagues will pick up on that point but I will leave Ms Goggin with this comment; I argue that every cartel acts in its own economic interest.

The banks were able to wave these decisions of the Financial Services Ombudsman, only to find out as a result of the Central Bank tracker mortgage investigation that they were right all along, the bank was wrong and the Financial Services Ombudsman was wrong.  I am not saying this personally to Mr. Deering because I am aware that he was not in the office at the time, and I know that the staff at the time were trying to do their best, but they made wrong decisions over and over again.

A number of tracker mortgage complaints had been only partly examined because the sale of the product was the critical factor.

That is very necessary and I am glad to hear it will happen.  Will it examine the wages and working conditions of employees in that industry?  I do not have much experience of rural collections but in the greater Dublin area the industry seems to be in a race to the bottom in terms of working conditions for employees.  One can also discern that many immigrant workers are employed in the sector in the greater Dublin area and I am very concerned as to how well advised of their employment rights they are.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are probably aware that it can be very difficult for fire services and emergency vehicles to access some streets in Dublin because three vehicles may be heading in the same direction at the same time.  Complaints in that regard have been made in city and county council areas.  The study should investigate whether it would be possible to recommend a bidding system such that one company would win a tender from the county council for waste collection on narrow urban or suburban streets.  I appreciate that is a tender issue but some of the current practice is very dangerous, in particular in areas with many elderly people and in which ambulances and similar vehicles cannot get through.  I am glad the study is to be undertaken.<\/p> <p>  Will it also examine pricing and pricing packages?  The amount of information and arbitrariness of price changes is very difficult for many consumers, in particular pensioners, for whom waste charges take up a relatively large amount of a limited pension.  I have been told, and think evidence was given to another committee or Deputies in this regard, that brown bin services are not being utilised, possibly because it is easier to burn everything since the advent of the incinerator.  However, that is causing a difficulty for compost businesses, in particular in rural Ireland, which are very unsure about the future of their market.

At a time when credit finance from the banks is extremely difficult to access it is an avenue which people can explore and use.  I am concerned, however, about the crossover when young people are applying for mortgages in that they may end up with a riskier credit profile because they have borrowed &euro;20,000 and so on to purchase a car.  While young people are availing of this consumer financing market now further on in their lives if they have secured good jobs and they want to apply for a mortgage to purchase a house - which we all hope will happen for everybody - they may find it is a very big disadvantage that they have been involved in a PCP, particularly one that went wrong and ended acrimoniously.  Does the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority offer advice on PCPs?  I believe that advice is very important for young people, many of them are accumulating debt without understanding the significance of it.  Many of these deals often end badly and thus result in the a person having a bad credit rating.  Also, banks might tend to look less favourably on the applications for mortgages from people who have previously displayed a tendency to purchase big cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#N00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>The subject of this meeting is the tracker mortgage issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#N00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1512637200,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I am coming to that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#N00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>Perhaps I could give a brief respond to the Deputy's questions.

I doubt, if he had it all back again, that he would come forward as the bank that he complained about was not investigated the way it should have been.  That is the experience of a whistleblower, so much more needs to be done to unearth the information required to take a case.  That is why I would expect far greater action from the commission.  Honestly, I do not see it.  All we have seen and heard at this committee, time and again, is how the consumer is ripped off and information is withheld from the consumer if he or she tries to take a case.  When such people come forward, records of meetings and tape recordings go missing.  Suddenly, if they are pushed and there is energy on the side of the consumer, the bank may stand down or give in, to a certain extent.  As Ms Goggin can see from the various witnesses that we had before us, they are worn down by the banks and what is being done.  They turn to agencies like the commission for help.<\/p> <p>  This gives rise to the question of whether the commission is afraid of the banks.  Is it afraid to take on the banks in such a way as to make it clear to them that the commission is going about its business?  Many years ago an advertisement was put in the paper with regard to planning issues.  Ask the employees if they will come forward and if they have a story to tell.  The stories I hear about banks would make the hair stand on one's head.  I did not believe them in the beginning but we got the correspondence and had the hearings.  The stories only got worse.

We must plough through the process with the Central Bank and the ombudsman as backup to get that form of redress for consumers.  We need to get to the end of the process and get the report from the Central Bank.  We must consider that and see exactly what was going on.

Is it obviously changing or is Mr. Deering still having to deal with banks that are caught in that culture in which they just will not admit that they are wrong?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#R01900","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>It has changed for some banks.

Regarding the banks, I would raise the issue of culture.  Where were these decisions made and were individuals rewarded for illegally pushing people off tracker mortgages?  It is important to understand the chain of command and whether, as the Chairman very rightly inquired, this goes to the very top.  There must be accountability and we need to have understanding of culture.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned our own powers earlier.  We would welcome the ability to impose fines on the basis of the civil burden of proof.  Civil fines could be levied where there is not the degree of evidence needed to get into a full criminal hearing in the Central Criminal Court.  One feature of our own legislation that I think is very useful is director disqualification.  It is a real disincentive to engage in illegal conduct if people feel that not only will they be penalised for it, they will also be disbarred as directors for the next five years, or whatever it might be.  If it is possible to have some of that brought in as individual sanctions in regulating the banking sector, that would be very useful for cases where the accountability goes right to the very top.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#S02100","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>This is more a general comment than one specific to the tracker mortgage issue.  One of the main traits of financial institutions that causes great distress to people is that consumers simply cannot talk to somebody in these banks who knows what is in their file.  That got a little bit better a couple of years ago.  However, a lot of the calls to our helpline are from individuals who are in contact with their bank and find that it does not know who they are, what they are entitled to or what they are owed.   That ultimately speaks to an issue around the banks' respect for their customers.  A higher standard should be expected in an area where somebody is reliant on his or her family home and the finance that the bank provides to it.  It might be a small consideration in the wider scheme of things, but we see it day in, day out.  It causes huge distress and frustration to consumers in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017120700002#S02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Leary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512637200,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>I would ask the banks why they are so determined not to sit down and do the right thing for their customers.  I say that even when they bring complaints to our office.  From time to time, I have been threatened with judicial review by banks claiming that I am dealing with complaints that are outside my jurisdiction.  In our new dispute resolution process, we have told the financial service providers not to worry as much about jurisdiction as about the customer.  We have highlighted that this is a customer of theirs who is unhappy and has a complaint.  Yet the banks argue that we do not have jurisdiction to deal with it when we are trying to solve the problem for them.  I would tell the banks to engage in our dispute resolution processes, because that has the potential to bring solutions much more quickly and in a much less difficult way.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is very important and it was discussed quite extensively between the Central Bank and this committee.  The Central Bank believes that people who could be impacted upon by this examination have been identified and that some banks are unwilling to do the right thing by those complainants.  Those complainants need to know that they are affected so that they can make a complaint to us, for example.  The committee could ask the banks how they will they notify these people.  It is important that they know who they are.  The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau does not know who they are.  The Central Bank may or may not know the individual names, though I doubt they do.  The banks know who they are, and those people who have been affected need to know.

I welcome the deputy commissioner, Mr. John Twomey, who is joined by Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director of finance and services; Mr. John O'Driscoll, assistant commissioner responsible for special crime operations; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; Mr. Michael Finn, assistant commissioner responsible for roads, policing and major event management; and Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, assistant commissioner responsible for security and intelligence.

I will give a brief overview of each issue and then we will be happy to take whatever questions follow.  On the Crowe Horwath report, as we stated during our public session with the Policing Authority two weeks ago, and I repeat here today, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na unreservedly apologises for the unacceptable behavioural and governance failures which led to the widespread inaccurate recording of mandatory alcohol breath tests over a period of time.  Significant organisational failures have undermined both the validity of statistical data produced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the contribution of breath tests to road safety.  The systems and governance failures that led to the wrongful prosecution and conviction of individuals for road traffic offences is again an unacceptable failure by the Garda organisation for which we unreservedly apologise.<\/p> <p>  Our focus now is on ensuring such failures cannot and do not occur again.  A series of measures relating to governance, systems, data quality, culture, ethics, policy and oversight, allied with individual and collective accountability have either been put in place or are in the process of being put in place.  Our approach to regaining public confidence will be centred on achieving the right behaviours, guided by the right values.<\/p> <p>  Regaining public confidence to levels previously enjoyed will not be achieved overnight and that is why we are focusing on strategic initiatives which will provide solid foundations for public confidence in the medium and long term.  These will be matched with actions in the short term to address any outstanding governance, systems, policy and technical failures which caused this crisis.<\/p> <p>  Measures to be taken include: ethics training for all personnel; reckless or deliberate misrecording of information to be treated as a serious disciplinary breach; the employment of a chief data officer and a number of data quality initiatives; individual and team performance reviews; the restructuring and strengthening of the traffic corps units into roads policing with increased personnel and new functions; and to enhance front-line supervision with 250 sergeant and 50 inspector vacancies to be filled in 2018 with further supervisors provided to front-line policing through civilianisation during the same year.<\/p> <p>  We are also considering proposals to extend training recently conducted for all senior managers under the auspices of the Kennedy Institute Maynooth University to address this issue through a restorative process.  It is intended that this approach will have a greater impact on changing behaviour than the adversarial approach which focuses on who is to blame and what punishment or sanction is required, but ultimately does not change behaviour.<\/p> <p>  On the Garda budget, it is critical that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides an efficient and effective policing and security service within the budget available to us.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is keenly aware that this is taxpayers&rsquo; money and we have a duty to spend it wisely ensuring value for money.  Our overtime budget in 2017 was under significant strain throughout the year and required a supplementary budget from Government.  In order to ensure that we could stay within the funding made available to us for 2017, it was necessary to reduce non-essential overtime for a period of six days at the end of November.<\/p><p>Policing services, however, continued during that time, in the area of serious and organised crime in the Dublin metropolitan region under Operation Hybrid, under Operation Thor, which is the nationwide anti-burglary initiative, and in a number of other road safety initiatives.  Additional resources were provided for these and other such serious operations.<\/p><p> We were provided with a significant budget in 2017.  The same level of budget will not be available to us in 2018.  It is incumbent on us, as senior managers in the organisation, to ensure we stay within that budget for 2018, particularly in light of the increasing number of Garda personnel and civilians who have joined the organisation in the past number of years, and who will join during 2018.  This has been reiterated to all senior managers.<\/p><p> As we outlined two weeks ago to the Committee of Public Accounts, as part of the programme for Government six Garda stations were to be reopened on a pilot basis.  The Commissioner was asked by the Department of Justice and Equality to identify those six stations with specific criteria, to include a mix of urban and rural, a minimum of one in Dublin, and a good geographical spread.  Furthermore, the Department advised that the stations to be considered for reopening must still be in State ownership.  In total, 139 Garda stations were closed originally.  Of these, 78 could potentially be reopened.  In Dublin, for example, four stations could potentially be reopened.  Based on the criteria provided, a scoping exercise was conducted by an assistant commissioner, with views taken from each relevant regional assistant commissioner following consultation with local stakeholders.  Census data was also examined, as was data on crime trends from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service.<\/p><p> Following a report from the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Driscoll, the acting Commissioner approved the reopening of the following stations.  In alphabetical order, they are Ballinspittle, Bawnboy, Donard, Leighlinbridge, Rush and Stepaside.  They comprise a station close to the Border, two in Dublin but at either end of the county with one of them large and the other smaller, another in the most southerly part of west Cork, along with a spread across five of the six Garda regions.  This reflects ample consideration of the criteria provided to us.  In this regard, we are liaising with the Office of Public Works to determine what remedial works need to be done at each station, the length of time it will take to complete the work and the associated costs of the works.  Furthermore, an examination of the resources required will be undertaken, which will examine the numbers of staff, equipment and vehicles and the ICT infrastructure required to determine in what order these stations are opened and the timeline for when they are likely to be opened.  This review will also take into account the Garda personnel available and any pressing existing resource requirements.<\/p><p> The procedures governing communication between the Commissioner and the Department of Justice and Equality are set out in legislation, under sections 26 and 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  The Commissioner is obliged to keep the Department of Justice and Equality informed of relevant matters relating to policing and security issues.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality are finalising a joint communications protocol governing all communications between both bodies.  This includes the circumstances and issues which would give rise to the Commissioner informing the Minister for Justice and Equality of matters of concern under section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.<\/p><p> A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was injured this morning.  He was shot in the line of duty.

I will be relatively brief because I am getting a bit sick of these meetings, and I do not mean that in a derogatory way.  This is the third sitting we have had on the same events.  The first time we sat here we got the apologies and explanations.  We were told systems were in place and they were going to be dealt with.  The second time we had the internal report telling us all the measures that had been put in place and the new explanations.  Now we have another report giving us more explanations and contradicting some of the previous explanations.  Where it really gets me is that issues which I specifically put to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the last time directly and repeatedly, and I have the transcript, particularly on the issue of checkpoints, were disputed by all the witnesses stating it was not the case.  I put it that the issue really was checkpoints and that we had considerable evidence on this.  One would not have to be a rocket scientist to realise that one of the key reasons the breath test figure was being inflated was because checkpoints which went up on the system and then had to be cancelled were being recorded as having been done.  The witnesses told me this could not happen.  Crowe Horwath's report states this is exactly what happened and it put it much more articulately than I did.  It states some members would inflate the number of checkpoints recorded on PULSE, and thereby the number of breath tests, in order to be seen to have delivered the number of checkpoints authorised for that tour of duty.  It also states they simply could not manage to perform all those which had been authorised and the habit had, therefore, developed of entering erroneous data onto PULSE.  For instance, if three were authorised and only one was carried out, two checkpoints might be registered on PULSE.  As we all know, a zero cannot be registered so five or six breath tests would have to be put in.  What is the point of us coming here and asking questions?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017120700002#C00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1512642600,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy wants to have that dealt with as a stand-alone question or does she want to add to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017120700002#C00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1512642600,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>I have other points on the checkpoints.

I spoke about how management in a station never thought of joining the dots and asking how could there have been three checkpoints the previous night given there was a riot on the main street and the station was processing people all night and arresting them.  It just did not add up.  On the previous occasion, the witnesses denied that could have happened, and Mr. O'Sullivan's report does not address it.

The Crowe Horwath report specifically makes the point that the problem was not linked to a reduction in the number of sergeants and that, in fact, some divisions with fewer sergeants performed significantly better than other divisions with more sergeants.  That is another contradiction.  The witnesses will see the problem members have with these meetings.<\/p> <p>  As to the point of explaining to members the system for nullifying checkpoints, we know that as we discussed that precise scenario at our pervious meeting.  It was in that context that we asked how the Garda could be sure all of the scheduled checkpoints that should have been cancelled were cancelled.  We were basically told it was not possible for garda&iacute; to claim they were out on checkpoints when they were not.

It is horrific for him and everyone involved with him.  Believe it or not, I know a lot of garda&iacute; and I understand how they feel about each other.  I extend my condolences to them.<\/p> <p>  I, too, will be brief.  We asked a lot of questions at the previous meeting.  As Deputy Clare Daly outlined, we were not very happy with the responses we received.  The common themes and conclusions in the report were: inadequate and inconsistent performance management; a deficit of accountability throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; management that failed to ensure that adequate processes, training and supervision were in place; and a culture that displayed a casual approach to data, which is obviously linked to the fact that it is now so difficult to hold people to account.  In cost-benefit terms, it is considered too expensive to hold people to account because the data have been so poor.  What we find mind-boggling is that the phrases \"I didn&rsquo;t know\" and \"I didn&rsquo;t ask\" featured on the previous occasion.  We spoke to many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - of all ranks - before the report came out.  They told us what was happening.  They knew what was happening and they were able to tell us.  When we come to the committee and put the questions to the witnesses, however, they deny knowing anything about it.  This is not rocket science.  If the witnesses did not know anything about it, the obvious question is why that is the case, particularly as they are running the organisation.  If they did know, they are pulling the wool over our eyes.  We do not know the answer.  All we know is that the witnesses do not need us to tell them that their organisation is being questioned as to how it is being managed.<\/p> <p>  The majority of people in this country still think the average garda is a good guy.  I can say for a fact that I would prefer to be dealing with the police in Ireland than in Italy or France.  The ordinary members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are seriously upset and angry in many cases about how the organisation is run.  The witnesses are the people who are running it.  We have been challenging some of the Garda Commissioners because we felt they were not doing the job properly.  We like to think that the boss should be in charge and take responsibility but from what we can see, that is not what happens.  In the context of the absolute shambles of the inflated breath-testing statistics and those relating to checkpoints, I do not accept that it is so difficult to hold people to account on foot of the fact that there are so many issues and people involved.  My feeling is that the people who run the organisation must surely take more responsibility.  That is not happening, however.  The witnesses are in denial rather than it being a case of putting their hands up and saying it goes back to senior management because that is where it starts.  There are not so many senior managers that they could not be held to account.  Perhaps someone might clarify the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017120700002#E00900","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512642600,"counter":1229,"content":"<p>At the Policing Authority and here this morning, what we have endeavoured to do is accept responsibility.

We have put that in writing and we said it at the previous meeting.  We said it most recently at the meeting with the Policing Authority.  We accept that there were governance issues and failings at management level.  We accept that there were issues in respect of the systems.  We accept that there were issues regarding the processes and training and that there was a combination of issues involved.  This started in 2006 and it runs for that period.  The system has changed.  There was a lack of training and supervision.  What we have tried to do both in Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan&rsquo;s report but also in our most recent public appearances at the Policing Authority is acknowledge each and every one of those elements of what went wrong and address them all.  I have accepted responsibility here again today for the failings that happened, and the acting Commissioner did so on the previous occasion.  What I am doing this morning - and what we have provided in writing - is setting out how we believe we are going to address the situation.  That applies across the entire organisation.<\/p> <p>  We have brought in the Kennedy Institute of Maynooth University to look at the behaviours.

We are looking at this crisis as an opportunity to ensure that into the future all of our actions will be guided by the right behaviours and values.

That is where we are trying to move to, and we have brought in a variety of different measures to ensure we will do that.  We are committed to doing that and to delivering it.  What is central to all of that is our code of ethics.  We in senior management have already undergone training on the code of ethics and the restorative practice training with the Kennedy Institute.

To be honest, we found it hard to believe that the things he told us about could still be happening, including how senior management dealt with this when he raised concerns about certain issues.  It was very disheartening for us because while people might think that Deputies Daly and Wallace just want to give out about things, we will not be vindicated until we have a police force that everybody is proud of.  We have been tackling these issues for five years, and if nothing is changing, it means that maybe we are wasting our time and we have failed.  We want things to be done right.<\/p> <p>  It was very disappointing to look at the information the garda gave to us about this.  He has given a protected disclosure but we have not put it in to the public domain yet.  His message to us was that not much has changed yet.

Poor Maurice McCabe is, in some ways, lucky to be alive still and that he did not do away with himself when the pressure was so great on him at times.

They come in to us very regularly.  Before I start today I wish to raise one point.  I appreciate that other colleagues and the deputy commissioner have already mentioned it but, especially on the day that is in it, I believe it is worth putting it on record.<\/p><p>Listening to news reports on what it really is like to serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na offers perspective and reminds us of the debt of gratitude that we owe the Garda, because there is no other profession where members go out to work daily to serve the community and put their lives at risk.  This morning shows that there is a core of men and women to whom we owe an incredible debt and thanks each day, and that includes people at all levels of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> It is disappointing, as a member of the Committee on Justice and Equality, to listen to report after report and comment after comment on various things which have occurred.  Everyone has alluded to there being almost a sense of fatigue about repeatedly asking questions,, so I do not intend to do that today.  We have reached a point where, through inquiries and so on, I have a very good idea of what happened.  Deputy Clare Daly has referred to this, but I want to note that the one thing I do not buy is the lack of supervision on how this happened.  It annoys me when I hear that because it somehow implies that a lack of supervision at sergeant level or similar in stations was at the heart of this.  There was a systemic failure of management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it did untold damage because it created a culture at all ranks that made something which, when one steps back to look, is unacceptable, where people who signed up to do all the things I referred to, namely, serving the community and putting themselves at risk in so doing, were put in a situation where they were distorting the truth, falsifying information, and doing the type of things that they were employed to stop happening.  That failure of management was one of the greatest disservices to the institution of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> There will be a new Commissioner and new structures are in place.  I am pleased to hear about some of the work on ethics which is being put in place.  There is now a Policing Authority which was not there.  There is a process for investigation when dealing with whistleblowing.  What happens now is how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will really be judged.  The deputy commissioner has made it very clear in his opening remarks that this is a change process.  We must see, and very quickly, that it is real and meaningful.  There cannot be incidents coming down the line in 14 or 18 months that give the information that what is happening now is not the truth in there being real attitudinal change and a real change in management.  If that is not there it will be impossible for anyone to support it.  If the type of ingrained change being discussed does happen, we will come out of this with a better police force.<\/p><p> The notion of going after rank-and-file garda&iacute; through disciplinary proceedings would not only be abhorrent to me, but also completely wrong.  To pursue the grassroots of an organisation when the real problem lay up the line would be one of the State's greatest wastes of money.  I do not have a problem with just moving on.  There are certain people in public life who are almost collecting a trophy wall out of the mess that has been created, mostly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's own hand, but it is as though they are collecting one trophy after the next.  I do not subscribe to that and think it is crazy.  One cannot decapitate everybody.  There are many examples in the private sector where people did appalling things while running companies, failed in their obligations to pay what was right and proper to the State and so on.  This is a forgiving country.  People come back.  If the restructuring, rebuilding and new management is there, then that is what we will judge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017120700002#F03000","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512642600,"counter":1265,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses wish to respond?

The buy-in is very real.  We are of the firm belief that we need to achieve the right behaviours being guided by the right values.  That is where we have moved into this restorative process.  We absolutely accept the point that to commence a discipline process against some sections of the organisation and not others would be wrong, and that is why we have taken a more holistic, across the organisation approach from ethical and cultural perspectives.  We have recently completed our cultural audit.  As we sit here, these findings are being analysed.  All the learnings from each of those programmes will come together to achieve the change to which the Deputy referred.<\/p> <p>  We are of one mind on the behaviours and culture that we want to develop in the organisation, but it is a large organisation that is here since 1922 and the culture and behaviours are ingrained in it since then, so it will take time.  The firm commitment I can give here is that the people sitting at this side of the table are absolutely committed that this is the direction in which we are going and we will provide the leadership required for us to move the organisation in that direction.  I do not know any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who did not join to serve or who does not come into work every day to serve their community and do their best by it.  We would not have the country we have that we can all be proud of were that not the case.  That is a positive thing.  It is absolutely the case that there are things we need to address, and we are giving a commitment about what we are going to do with that.  I share the Deputy's view of the future and the direction in which we are going in that, and I thank the Deputy for his support.<\/p> <p>  On supervision, Crowe Horwath would say that there are a number of issues and areas, of which this is one.  As I set out at the outset, there are a combination of reasons.  Crowe Horwath says in its report, and the Policing Authority says in its commentary, that no supervision is needed for people to write in the correct records.  We cannot get away from that.  We cannot pick one factor and say that is the reason for everything and if we fix that, the problem will be resolved.  Given the extent of the problem and the length of the period during which it was ongoing, and because of systems and myriad issues, some sections did not provide the governance there ought to have been, and that is a lesson we have learned.  It is a combination of reasons.  When I read the Crowe Horwath report, I did so in its entirety, and my summation is that there were a number of weaknesses right throughout the organisation from the top to the bottom, and we acknowledge that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017120700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey"},{"type":"speech","time":1512642600,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>The next set of questions will be from Deputy Jack Chambers who will be followed by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, Senator Martin Conway, Deputy Alan Kelly, and Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017120700002#G00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1512642600,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>I thank the deputy commissioner and the rest of the management team who are here.

We have learned a lot of lessons from it.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the whole process, if a checkpoint is set up nowadays, we record exactly the Dr&auml;ger device that was used and the readings, at both start and finish.  We have a supervisor nominated to oversee the checkpoint to go back and to check afterwards to make sure it was accurate.  One of the difficulties we had in the past is that management simply did not have the tools, because of our lack of investment in IT, to be able to go back and verify what was done.  We have improved that.  We have reports available to management so that they can see exactly.  If they want to check who was on the checkpoint last night and the number of cars that were checked against the devices - in the past, we did not have the capacity to do it - that capacity is there now.  The structures to provide the capacity to oversee and manage, which we did not have, has been put in place.  Crowe Horwath, in fairness, has acknowledged that in its report.  It is not only about changing the tools, however, we have to change the behaviour.  That is why the deputy commissioner was acknowledging the wider programme of change which is taking place within the organisation.  Specifically, we have dealt with changing our processes.<\/p> <p>  Indeed, the Deputy mentioned supervision earlier.  It was acknowledged in the Crowe Horwath report that there was a difficulty with supervision, particularly at the front line.  We have started the process to beef up that.

They are not only about numbers, statistics and percentages.  All of our pieces relate to interactions with individuals.  That is probably where we need to start.  When we get people to think that the statistical return is not about the return, it is about what is behind that information.  That is the cultural difference that we are striving to achieve.  If people can look at it in that way, it changes the dynamics where suddenly one realises that one's interaction with an individual, whether it is a breath test or whether it is some other matter that one is addressing and dealing with, is the important part and that the data are almost a follow-on from that.

On that day, the acting Commissioner said there was no <i>prima facie<\/i>evidence relating to criminality but that there was evidence of individual breaches of discipline.

What we would say is that everybody in the organisation is being dealt with under the process we are talking about.

Approximately 28 fewer people have been killed on our roads thus far this year.  The context of this entire debate is road safety.  What is important is that we keep people alive on our roads.  The records of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority and the people of Ireland, particularly those who have improved their compliance with road traffic legislation, have contributed to increased road safety.  The results of this are such that almost year-on-year there has continued to be a reduction in deaths and serious injuries on our roads.  In this regard, over the period about which Deputy Kelly has been speaking, we have gone from 15th in Europe to in the region of 5th or 6th.  This year again there has been a further reduction.  It is important to remember that road safety has improved considerably over the years.  The number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads has reduced.

The proposed legislation will allow for the early release of records if a Cabinet Minister and I, as Minister with responsibility for the National Archives, agree that the early release of the records in question is warranted by virtue of the historical or public interest value of the records or to facilitate fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  The National Archives, as we know, is one of the State's most important cultural institutions and it plays an essential part in the cultural life of the country by collecting, managing and preserving the public record of Ireland.

It is a very diverse and interesting space.  There is a number of big-ticket items that, as Minister, she can have massive influence over.  She can change the direction and the experience of many people in this sector.  We will have plenty of time to debate them in the future, but I wish her luck.<\/p><p>With regard to the Bill we are considering here, it is a good move by the Government that such a Bill would be brought before the D&aacute;il.  Information is really powerful, and transparency allows for better oversight of Government actions and better understanding of historical events.  Obviously, this is reflecting the fact that in Britain there has been a move to a 20-year rule and we are catching up.  There will be a little bit of divergence for a number of years and that is not a good thing because we will have information from one side of the coin coming to the fore while that on the other side of the coin will take years, so our understanding will be unbalanced in many of these activities.<\/p><p>One of those activities will be the Good Friday Agreement, for which the papers will be released shortly in Britain.  <\/p><p> One of the problems I have with the Bill is resources.  The National Archives has been very badly hit with regard to resources, yet it will be facing a very big job in terms of shifting and sifting through documents.  Another issue I have with the Bill is the political issue and that is why I tabled my two amendments.  There is a danger with this Bill if it has too strong a political oversight.  Human nature and political nature is such that if certain documents arise that are unhelpful or shed a negative light on a party colleague there could be an instinct where a Minister or Government could decide a particular document is not the relevant type of document to be transferred under the 20-year rule.  We have Ministers or colleagues in the current Government who were Ministers 20 years ago.  While that is not the intent of the Minister or her Department, it would be a good idea, as an Oireachtas, that we seek to neutralise the political influence over these documents.  That is why I have asked for a role for the Information Commissioner to be provided for in this area.  <\/p><p> On page 4, line 27, section 3(2) states: \"the Minister makes an order\".  My amendment No. 3 seeks to substitute that phrase with &ldquo;the Information Commissioner is satisfied&rdquo;.  I have outlined the purpose of my two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017120700002#A00900","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512653100,"counter":1535,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution and good wishes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the specific amendment about the Information Commissioner, our view is that he has a specific role in terms of freedom of information but that is quite distinct from his role for the National Archives.  He has also said that he would be reluctant to take on what appears to be a decision-making role as it may not fit in with his statutory role as an Information Commissioner.  It is for these reasons that I cannot accept the amendments. <\/p> <p>  I would like to address some of the comments made about political influence.  It is clear that we want a balanced approach and there are some checks and balances in place.  For example, there is no obligation for the documents to be released early.  This legislation simply gives the legal mechanism for that to be done.  The checks and balances are done through the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, myself and the Minister in place in a particular Department.  Three conditions mush also be met, namely, the documents have to be of historical relevance, they must be in the public interest and there must be fair and balanced reports.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that this is a presumptive release within this Act.  These records will be released in 30 years; it is not that they are never going to released.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a matter for the implementation plan.  The interdepartmental group is considering the plan at the moment.  I understand the group will report early next year but it could be at the end of this year.  The group is considering whether the checks and balances to which the Deputy referred are in place.  We could consider regulations under section 19(1) of the Act but we will have to wait and see.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that there is a gap.  We want to make sure, particularly when talking about sensitive Anglo-Irish issues, that there is a balanced historical approach in this context and that our records catch up with the UK.  As the Deputy will know, the UK started in 2013 with its Act.  Therefore, it has had a head start and we have some catching up to do.<\/p> <p>  For the reasons that I have outlined I cannot accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017120700002#B00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1512653100,"counter":1536,"content":"<p>I would be more comfortable if the Minister were to identify a substitute individual.  I mean somebody from within the State institutions who could take on the role that I have suggested for the Information Commissioner.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is right that the records will be released within 30 years.  However, the Bill as it currently stands leaves significant political decisions to be made about whether the documents will be released after 20 years.  The 20-year rule changes the nature of a document to a certain extent as it brings it into the likely timespan of an existing politician.  If a document is released in the space of 20 years there is a good chance that the document to which the information pertains will relate to a Minister who is still a sitting Deputy.

The purpose of the amendment is simply to make the system more transparent and less opaque.
