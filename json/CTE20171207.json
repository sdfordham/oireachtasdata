I look forward to serving as Minister and working with all the stakeholders involved in these important sectors.  I will listen with interest to the input of committee members here today and to the various issues raised.  I would also like to thank committee members for their contributions and for their support for the draft Bill.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this Bill is to commence the reduction from 30 years to 20 years of the time limit for the deposit of departmental records with the National Archives.  The proposed legislation will allow for the early release of records if a Cabinet Minister and I, as Minister with responsibility for the National Archives, agree that the early release of the records in question is warranted by virtue of the historical or public interest value of the records or to facilitate fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  The National Archives, as we know, is one of the State's most important cultural institutions and it plays an essential part in the cultural life of the country by collecting, managing and preserving the public record of Ireland.

It is a very diverse and interesting space.  There is a number of big-ticket items that, as Minister, she can have massive influence over.  She can change the direction and the experience of many people in this sector.  We will have plenty of time to debate them in the future, but I wish her luck.<\/p><p>With regard to the Bill we are considering here, it is a good move by the Government that such a Bill would be brought before the D&aacute;il.  Information is really powerful, and transparency allows for better oversight of Government actions and better understanding of historical events.  Obviously, this is reflecting the fact that in Britain there has been a move to a 20-year rule and we are catching up.  There will be a little bit of divergence for a number of years and that is not a good thing because we will have information from one side of the coin coming to the fore while that on the other side of the coin will take years, so our understanding will be unbalanced in many of these activities.<\/p><p>One of those activities will be the Good Friday Agreement, for which the papers will be released shortly in Britain.  <\/p><p> One of the problems I have with the Bill is resources.  The National Archives has been very badly hit with regard to resources, yet it will be facing a very big job in terms of shifting and sifting through documents.  Another issue I have with the Bill is the political issue and that is why I tabled my two amendments.  There is a danger with this Bill if it has too strong a political oversight.  Human nature and political nature is such that if certain documents arise that are unhelpful or shed a negative light on a party colleague there could be an instinct where a Minister or Government could decide a particular document is not the relevant type of document to be transferred under the 20-year rule.  We have Ministers or colleagues in the current Government who were Ministers 20 years ago.  While that is not the intent of the Minister or her Department, it would be a good idea, as an Oireachtas, that we seek to neutralise the political influence over these documents.  That is why I have asked for a role for the Information Commissioner to be provided for in this area.  <\/p><p> On page 4, line 27, section 3(2) states: \"the Minister makes an order\".  My amendment No. 3 seeks to substitute that phrase with &ldquo;the Information Commissioner is satisfied&rdquo;.  I have outlined the purpose of my two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017120700002#A00900","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512653100,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution and good wishes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the specific amendment about the Information Commissioner, our view is that he has a specific role in terms of freedom of information but that is quite distinct from his role for the National Archives.  He has also said that he would be reluctant to take on what appears to be a decision-making role as it may not fit in with his statutory role as an Information Commissioner.  It is for these reasons that I cannot accept the amendments. <\/p> <p>  I would like to address some of the comments made about political influence.  It is clear that we want a balanced approach and there are some checks and balances in place.  For example, there is no obligation for the documents to be released early.  This legislation simply gives the legal mechanism for that to be done.  The checks and balances are done through the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, myself and the Minister in place in a particular Department.  Three conditions mush also be met, namely, the documents have to be of historical relevance, they must be in the public interest and there must be fair and balanced reports.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that this is a presumptive release within this Act.  These records will be released in 30 years; it is not that they are never going to released.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a matter for the implementation plan.  The interdepartmental group is considering the plan at the moment.  I understand the group will report early next year but it could be at the end of this year.  The group is considering whether the checks and balances to which the Deputy referred are in place.  We could consider regulations under section 19(1) of the Act but we will have to wait and see.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that there is a gap.  We want to make sure, particularly when talking about sensitive Anglo-Irish issues, that there is a balanced historical approach in this context and that our records catch up with the UK.  As the Deputy will know, the UK started in 2013 with its Act.  Therefore, it has had a head start and we have some catching up to do.<\/p> <p>  For the reasons that I have outlined I cannot accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12017120700002#B00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1512653100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I would be more comfortable if the Minister were to identify a substitute individual.  I mean somebody from within the State institutions who could take on the role that I have suggested for the Information Commissioner.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is right that the records will be released within 30 years.  However, the Bill as it currently stands leaves significant political decisions to be made about whether the documents will be released after 20 years.  The 20-year rule changes the nature of a document to a certain extent as it brings it into the likely timespan of an existing politician.  If a document is released in the space of 20 years there is a good chance that the document to which the information pertains will relate to a Minister who is still a sitting Deputy.
