Mr. Chairman, I have provided a written statement to the inquiry on the topics you raised with me and I would like this morning to make a few general points.<\/p> <p>  The first, and to me the most important point, I would ask the inquiry to bear in mind that my role as non-executive governor or chairman of Bank of Ireland ended in July 2005, just under ten years ago and I have absolutely no involvement with the bank in the intervening decade.  Whilst I am anxious to assist the inquiry as much as I can and do not wish to appear in any way unhelpful, the truth is my recollection of events, of meetings and correspondence is significantly impaired by the passage of time.  It happens to all of us and I trust the inquiry will understand and accept this.  I note that a lot of the documents you have sent me relate to periods after I left the bank and I hope you will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment in any way on these documents.<\/p> <p>  The second point I would like to make concerns the standards of governance and oversight in the bank during my time there.  Most of the board, including myself, were non-executive and therefore part-time.  It is not the job of non-executives to run the bank nor are they or can they be expected to know everything that is going on in the bank.  Their role is an oversight one, to approve strategy and general direction and to be satisfied that there are proper governance structures in place.  In looking at historical practices, whether in banking or anywhere else, I believe that these practices should be judged against the standards of best practice which exists at that time.  There is no doubt that corporate governance has evolved significantly over the last decade, both generally for public companies and specifically for financial institutions in the light of the financial crisis but in my view, a fair assessment of practice in the past requires them to be judged in the context of standards of best practice at the time concerned.  <\/p> <p>  I believe that the structure which was in place in Bank of Ireland during my time there reflected best practice and I have summarised the main control processes which existed in my written statement.  I had no cause for concern about the adequacy or appropriateness of the reporting and the accountability structures which we benchmarked against practice at the time, with the help in particular of our internal auditors and our external auditors.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the strategy of the bank approved by the board in 2002, it is clear that this was an ambitious growth strategy.<\/p><p>It must be viewed, however, in the context of the economy at the time which was growing rapidly and with all indications pointing to a long period of sustained growth.  What is also important to note is that the strategy was not reliant on property lending.  My recall is that the growth in the balance sheet was to be achieved through a combination of acquisitions, particularly in life and pensions businesses, and through managing the capital of the bank through share buy-backs and other mechanisms.  We were particularly focused on growing the business outside Ireland and that was largely why we recruited a CEO who had been working abroad.  My understanding from reading the materials you have sent to me is that, in fact, property lending did not grow in a disproportionate fashion compared to other lending in Bank of Ireland and this would be what I would have expected from my experience there.  <\/p><p> In my written statement in relation to the subject of property lending, I say that I do not recall any issue of imprudent lending being brought to the board.  I understand that this statement by me has been put to one of the other witnesses.  I was not intending to suggest that executives were aware at the time of imprudent property lending and chose not to bring it to the board.  I'm completely satisfied that this is not the case.  There was always open dialogue between the board and the executives and I have no doubt that if there was a material issue relating to property lending, the board would have been informed.  Of course, the board were aware that the bank, like all banks, had bad debts and I recall that the bank was conservative in making provisions for bad debts.  While some of the bad debts may well have related to property lending, I have no reason to believe that this was a result of imprudent or reckless lending.  <\/p><p> Finally, in relation to property lending, I've seen references to the establishment of a specialist property group in the bank in late 2004, the implication being that this is evidence of a decision to place a particular emphasis on property lending.  I don't believe that the reason for the decision was to significantly increase the level of property lending.  It was part of a move towards specialisation, where individual lenders would focus on particular areas, rather than have someone who might be lending to a property developer in the morning and a grocer in the afternoon and I believe that this was a sensible approach.<\/p><p> Can I conclude by coming back to what is the role of a director?  For as long as I've been involved in business, it has always been the case that the primary duty of a director is to act in good faith in what he or she honestly believes is in the best interests of the company involved.  I understand that this principle has now been enshrined in legislation in the new Companies Act, recently passed by you and your colleagues in the Oireachtas.  I genuinely believe that everything I and other directors of Bank of Ireland did during my time was done in good faith in what we believed was the bank's best interests.  I believe we discharged our responsibilities to the best of our ability.  When, as I was leaving ... when I was leaving the bank in 2005, it was operating in a very strong economic environment and there were no signs that the bank would do anything but go from strength to strength.  If, with the benefit of hindsight, decisions taken during my time later contributed to the problems facing the bank, then this is clearly something I regret.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laurence Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Crowley.

As requested by you, I submitted a written statement on a number of specific topics identified by you.  I do not propose today to repeat all of the points made in my written statement, but I do want to highlight a number of points which I believe are of particular relevance to the business of the inquiry.  Looking at events from a number of years ago, it's important to try and recall and to understand the context in which actions were taken or decisions were made.<\/p><p>This is particularly so in circumstances where the banking world has changed so dramatically in the intervening period.  Before touching on some of the points made in my written statement, let me make a few brief words about the backdrop against which Bank of Ireland and other banks operated during my time on the board.<\/p><p> Peter Nyberg's evidence to the inquiry described that the global consensus back in the noughties was that financial markets were stable and efficient, a view to which Irish private and public sector decision makers adhered.  A number of previous witnesses before the inquiry have referred to the general economic backdrop to the early 2000s, including the strong growth in employment, the extraordinary growth in the Irish population and the consequent huge increase in demand for new housing.<\/p><p> The report by Regling and Watson, which forms part of the evidence presented to the inquiry, notes that Ireland's strong and extended expansion during the previous decade fostered expectations of a continued rise in living standards and in asset values.  Regling and Watson also note that in this macroeconomic setting bank governance and financial supervision faced major challenges and, looking back, I would agree with this observation.  They described banks operating in a setting of greatly increased wholesale funding opportunities following the adoption of the euro and banks from abroad beginning to compete strongly in retail mortgage lending.  Another factor highlighted by Regling and Watson was that when modern Ireland ... was that modern Ireland had never experienced a property crash.  As the chief economist of Bank of Ireland set out in his written statement to the inquiry, the fall in house prices in the first half of 2008 was modest and the full effect of the unprecedented collapse of the global credit markets which followed the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008 was not felt until 2009.  So the 2008 crisis was not primarily caused by the property devaluation but by other factors, later exacerbated by the collapse of property values.<\/p><p> I was asked to discuss the quality of the business model setting process in Bank of Ireland, which I took to mean the quality and setting of the strategic plans.  In my view, a key point to bear in mind when making judgments on a strategy setting process is the backdrop against which the strategy is developed.  Bank of Ireland's strategy was informed by the consensus view on likely economic developments in the countries in which the bank was most exposed to credit risk.  While I believe that the process for setting the bank's strategy was extensive and robust, in hindsight the bank's strategy, in common with other financial institutions in Ireland and internationally, which assumed continued economic growth in the bank's main markets, reflecting the consensus view, led the bank to expand in a manner which, as I said at the extraordinary general meeting of the bank in March 2009, was regrettable.  The bank's funding of that growth assumed the continued normal functioning of wholesale interbank markets, which did not happen, and the risk of this funding not being available was not, in light of our perception of future events at that time, fully appreciated.<\/p><p> While prudent strategic decisions were made to focus on the bank's core business, and not to enter into certain business segments, which meant that Bank of Ireland's position, when compared against many of its peer companies, was less severe overall, this was of little consolation to the bank's shareholders, who suffered a very serious decline in the value of their shares and through the cancellation of dividends.<\/p><p>At the extraordinary general meeting in March 2009, I also acknowledged that the bank's change of strategy, to a much more defensive position, was not commenced early enough in the cycle of the economic decline.  Reports commissioned by the bank in the period following the crisis have noted that while the bank could not have escaped the unusually severe economic downturn, the effects could have been mitigated if corrective action had been taken earlier.<\/p><p> As I said at the time and at the AGM in July 2009, I accept responsibility and accountability as governor for the situation in which Bank of Ireland found itself in 2008.  I also placed clearly on the record then, my appreciation of the Government actions in 2008 and 2009, which ensured the survival of Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p> I&rsquo;m referring to the guarantee, which stabilised the situation in September of 2008, the capital infusion into Bank of Ireland, since, thankfully ,fully repaid and the creation of NAMA and its acquisition of the banks property loans, which allowed Bank of Ireland to become an investable institution and thus allowed new, third-party shareholders to come aboard.  This package of support was comprehensive and determined the continued viability of the bank.  I have outlined in my written statement, the structures which were in place in Bank of Ireland in relation to risk monitoring.  A key issue in my view, is that despite these structures, we the board and management did not fully appreciate nor factor in the risk inherent in the rate of growth of the bank's core businesses and in particular, while property lending grew broadly in line with other lending, the risks arising from the absolute amount of property lending and from the group's reliance on wholesale funding.<\/p><p> In hindsight, risk should have been a more fundamental driver of the setting of strategy.  This would have resulted in a set of constraints around strategy development reflecting the risk appetite being set down by the board.  I do not believe that the appetite for property lending in Bank of Ireland was any greater than for lending into other sectors.  In particular, Bank of Ireland had a relatively lower appetite for, and by extension, lower relative exposure to, landbank lending than other banks in the Irish market.  So, while the growth in property lending was not disproportionate, the amount of the bank's property and construction book was significant and thus the bank was heavily exposed to the significant downturn in the Irish and UK property markets.<\/p><p> I have seen from the previous evidence sought by the inquiry, that the members have a strong interest in analysing the decision to introduce the bank guarantee on the night of 29 September 2008.  You have asked for my opinion on the appropriateness of that guarantee and in response, I would say that there is no doubt that the Government at the time found itself in an extraordinarily difficult situation, particularly on that night of 29 September, when it became clear that a liquidity default risk facing Anglo Irish Bank could have serious implications for the entire banking system.  I am not aware of the range of options considered by the Government at the end of September 2008 and I am not, therefore, in a position to comment on the appropriateness of the guarantee as against those other options.  I would say that in my view, the immediate funding requirements of Anglo Irish Bank could have been addressed by guaranteed financial support, which Bank of Ireland and AIB were prepared to make available in the short term to Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p><p>Such a decision may have given the Government more time to consider its options.  However, the Government chose to go further and to guarantee all financial institutions, which certainly avoided the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank that week.<\/p><p> Let me conclude these remarks by repeating that it was a source of great regret to the board of Bank of Ireland, which had served its stakeholders so well for over two centuries, that we required substantial support from the Irish taxpayer and from the State.  As I've said earlier, that support was comprehensive and ensured the continuing viability of the bank, and for that I remain very grateful.  I'll do my best to answer any questions which you may wish to raise, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Burrows","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Burrows, and thank you very much for your earlier comments, Mr. Crowley.

And when you're dealing with that, Mr. Burrows, could you also address that on page 90 you speak about the projected ... when you're looking at the general  ... that your sensitivity analysis ... the projections assume capital raising in the years '06-'07, '07-'08 and '08-'09 of the order of about &euro;4.3 billion.  And you said ... if the funding was not raised with \"Shock 1 Scenario\" that you basically would just be meeting your minimum regulatory capital requirements.

When did Bank of Ireland first explore the idea of a capital injection by the taxpayers?

As managing partner of KPMG from 2006 to 2013, I welcome this opportunity of discussing with you the role of KMPG as auditors in the period you're looking at.  I have provided a written ... a detailed written witness statement in response to the themes identified by the committee.  These themes include the integrity of financial reporting and the impact of prevailing standards in recognising risks.  In this brief opening oral statement I will deal with a number of matters in that witness statement, specifically the role of an audit, the purpose of financial reporting and the basis of the accounting standards used in financial reporting, the going concern issue when preparing accounts, and finally, I'll speak briefly about changes in these areas since 2008, which might have contributed to the avoidance of the crisis like the one we've gone through.<\/p> <p>  Personally, I've spent all my professional life in KPMG since joining in 1975.  I was a partner from May 1988 to April 2013.  I was head of audit from May 2004 to December 2006, which also involved participation in a number of financial institution audits, including a role on the AIB audit.  I held the position of managing partner from December 2006 to April 2013.  I've not held an active role within KPMG since retiring as managing partner in April 2013 but the firm has provided support and assistance to me in preparing for today, and I confirm that, in particular, I have consulted with, and received input from, Mr. Paul Dobey, who's also here today, and who was the lead partner on the AIB audit.<\/p> <p>  I'd firstly like to discuss the purpose of financial statements and the role of the external auditor, as there can be misunderstandings in relation to what an audit actually is and what certain commentators think or would like it to be, particularly in relation to the strategy and risk appetite of an entity.  The management of an entity is responsible for the preparation of its financial statements.  The overall responsibility for financial statements rests with the board.  The role of the audit is to provide a report to shareholders on those financial statements.  In reporting on whether the accounts present a true and fair view, auditors do an extensive amount of work in checking and verifying the systems producing the accounts as well as the financial information that is presented.  Those who prepare the accounts and the auditors who audit the statements must comply with an extensive framework of technical rules known as financial reporting standards and auditing standards.  These standards are set by independent international bodies, apply currently in some 280 jurisdictions, and are underpinned by national and by EU regulation.  The objective of having clearly defined financial reporting and auditing frameworks, standards and rules is to provide uniformity, consistency and transparency to the users of financial statements.  Without such rules, it would be very difficult to ensure the level playing field ... to ensure a level playing field in comparing the results and financial positions of companies across the world and the quality of audit reports on the accounts of those companies.  As far as KPMG is concerned, our work was carried out in accordance with our quality control framework for performing high quality audits and we believe that the accounts of the financial institutions we audited were prepared in compliance with the relevant international standards and that KPMG audited those accounts in accordance with their statutory duty and the auditing rules.  <\/p> <p>  In addition, I'd make the following two points.  Financial statements are a point-in-time record of financial information of an entity, including its results.  By definition, financial statements are a record of past financial performance and do not seek to forecast or predict future performance.  An audit opinion, which deals with whether accounts give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS, does not assure, for example, the long-term success or sustainability of the business model of an entity nor the effectiveness with which management has conducted its affairs.<\/p><p>This responsibility rests with the management and boards of the entity.<\/p><p> I would like briefly to discuss the accounting rules which make up the financial reporting framework.  From 2005 onwards, the rules that applied to Irish financial institutions was the set of international financial reporting standards known by the acronym IFRS.  The IFRS was developed by the International Accounting Standards Board, IASB, through a formal system of due process and broad international consultation involving the accounting profession, investors, governments, regulators and other interested parties.  IFRS seeks to ensure that financial statements provide consistent information about the financial position, past performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to those making economic decisions.  The adoption of IFRS in 2002 across the EU was endorsed with an overwhelming majority vote in the European Parliament and IFRS has force of law in Ireland by way of statutory instrument.<\/p><p> The auditing framework applicable to the audits of the financial statements of Irish institutions was the auditing and assurance pronouncement issued by the UK's Financial Reporting Council, a body independent of the auditing profession.  The use of this framework is part of the statutory licensing regime for auditors in Ireland.  The directors of our financial institutions which audit clients thus had responsibility for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS from 2005 onwards.  It was, and remains, KPMG&rsquo;s view that the financial reporting of the relevant institutions was conducted in accordance with the requirements of IFRS.<\/p><p> The KPMG teams performing bank audits during the relevant period were experienced in the application of auditing standards in IFRS and had an in-depth understanding of the banking sector.  These teams monitored emerging best practice through their connection with fellow KPMG firms in Europe and the US.  These audit teams had particularly close ties with our UK firm and were, therefore, familiar with best practice in the UK market and how the accounting and auditing standards were being applied there.<\/p><p> One of the most significant accounting standards impacting the Irish institutions was IAS 39, and its requirements regarding the recognition of provisions for loan losses.  My colleague, Paul Dobey, will deal with the issues arising from the fact that IAS 39 is based on an incurred rather than an expected loss model.<\/p><p> I said earlier that accounts were a point in time, and that the numbers that auditors reported on were historic and thus backward looking.  There is one matter however that falls to be considered in preparing a set of accounts that is forward looking, and that is the going concern basis of preparation.  This means that every year, when preparing the annual accounts, the directors of the company or a bank are required to consider whether they believe the entity will be in operational existence for at least one further year.  Typically directors make that assessment based on forecasts, budgets and an evaluation of the risks that the business faces.  Auditors are then required to assess whether directors' judgments and conclusions are reasonable and whether it is appropriate for the accounts to be prepared on the going concern basis.<\/p><p> Up to and including 2006 year end, the assessment of our audit teams, based on the economic assessments and forecasts of respected bodies, was that the going concern basis of preparation of the banks&rsquo; financial statements was appropriate.  The additional steps taken by our audit teams in respect of the subsequent years, in light of the unprecedented economic conditions, will be dealt with by Mr. Dobey.<\/p><p> KPMG is very conscious of and acknowledges the significant adverse impact which the banking crisis has had on our society, our people and our clients.  We recognise the important work of the joint committee in looking at the systemic issues involved in the crisis and more important, in identifying steps that might be taken to avoid a repeat.  KPMG is committed to and is assisting in this process, in particular in relation to further developing audit and corporate and financial reporting standards to reflect the lessons learned from the crisis.<\/p><p> And so the final issue I want to address are the changes in financial and reporting standards since 2008.  In light of the global financial crisis the International Accounting Standards Board, the IASB, completed a review of what changes might need to be made to accounting standards.  This review considered the lessons learned across more than 100 jurisdictions in which the IFRS had applied by 2008.  The IASB's post crisis review confirmed the important role of financial reporting in providing unbiased, transparent and relevant information.  However, it also recognised that only so much can be expected of accounting.  The IASB noted, and I cite the IASB chairman who said, that accounting standards could contribute to financial stability, but they should not be expected to provide a veneer of stability by ignoring volatility when it is really there.<\/p><p> The most important conclusion of the review, however, was probably that there should be a more forward looking impairment model for loan loss provisions.  It is only recently, after much debate and lots of transatlantic dialogue, that the IASB has agreed a new revised loan loss provisioning model that specified an expected rather than incurred loss model for loan loss provisioning.  This standard should permit the earlier recognition of loan losses.  As a result, it will be possible to recognise expected losses in the downturn when there is evidence of expected impairment.<\/p><p> Apart from the issue of how losses are recognised, a more wide ranging debate is also under way globally regarding how corporate reporting can be improved.  One body, the International Integrated Reporting Counsel, a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standards setters and the accounting profession, is examining ways in which to better set out in an integrated report what is happening in a business in more than just financial terms.  Such an integrated report would be a concise communication about how an organisational strategy, governance, performance and prospects in the context of an external environment, is intended to lead to the creation of value in the short, medium and long term.<\/p><p> To conclude, I have sought to give the committee an overview of the context of which financial statements are prepared and audited, the legal framework within which that work is done and some developments in standards since the crisis.  Mr. Dobey will address now, in more detail, how these principles and standards were applied now in the case of AIB.

Specifically I will explain why it is KPMG's view that the AIB financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and Irish law.<\/p> <p>  KPMG audited AIB in accordance with our statutory duty and the auditing rules.  The AIB accounts gave a true and fair view and the accounting rules and related laws were not a contributing factors to the banking crisis in Ireland.  Notwithstanding this, there are important lessons to be learned for the accounting profession from the crisis.<\/p> <p>  AIB was a large and complex organisation with over 25,000 employees in 2008 operating in Ireland, the UK, Poland and the US.  AIB had a very experienced board of directors, and an audit committee drawn from a wide range of disciplines.  The board oversaw the implementation of the strategy.  The audit committee oversaw the internal control and financial reporting of the bank.  The AIB accounts are very complex and expertise was required to make sure the transactions, balances and disclosures in these accounts were complete and the accounting was in accordance with IFRS.<\/p> <p>  The KPMG audit team, which comprised approximately 20 partners and over 200 managers and staff, had the expertise to deal with these matters.  The team applied the best practice auditing and accounting standards to the bank's published accounts.  A quality review partner for KPMG UK and an SEC reviewing partner from our US firm was also involved in the AIB audit, bringing a further international perspective.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. O' Rourke has outlined, AIB was required by EU and Irish law to comply with the IFRS accounting rules.  Similarly KPMG was required to carry out its statutory duties as auditors in accordance with Irish law and the relevant auditing rules which were international standards on auditing.  The AIB team took all the necessary steps to form an opinion that the AIB accounts gave a true and fair view.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements set out AIB's exposure to each sector, including the property and construction lending.  KPMG is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately disclosed the banks property related lending exposures.  AIB was aware of the risks arising from these business strategies, but like other financial institutions, did not anticipate the scale of the adverse circumstances which would give rise to unprecedented loses.<\/p> <p>  AIB had an extensive risk infrastructure and semi-annual risk reports were presented to the AIB board by the chief risk officer.  These reports dealt with the top ten risks facing AIB, including credit risk, operational risk, market risk and liquidity risk.  The risk relating to credit and liquidity featured with increasing prominence in these reports in the period from 2005 to 2008.  As Mr. O'Rourke has mentioned, there is a common misunderstanding in relation to the role that an auditor plays regarding the strategy and risk appetite.  For KPMG to have sought to determine AIB's business strategies would have been beyond our role and expertise as auditors, and would undermine our ability to give an independent auditor's report on the financial statements of our audit clients.<\/p> <p>  What KPMG did do, was to identify and report the risks to the AIB audit committee in the context of our audit work in order to ensure that the financial reporting implications were properly reflected in the financial statements.  Our consideration of these risks, and the audit findings on other communications with the AIB audit committee, were circulated to the Financial Regulator at the end of each audit.<\/p> <p>  Turning, if I may, to the integrity of financial reporting.  The most relevant standard for loan loss provisioning was IAS 39 which required the use of an incurred loss model.  This model has been criticised because, in order to avoid smoothing of profits which was and is considered undesirable, it did not allow banks to create or hold general provisions in the good years to offset problems in the bad years.  It is the view of KPMG that the operation of IAS 39 was not a contributing factor to the issues which AIB faced in 2008.  I am not saying that IAS 39 was perfect, we have learned from the crisis that it needs to be changed and Mr. O'Rourke has outlined some of the steps being taken in this regard.  The major shortcoming of IAS 39 was that it delayed the recognition of the loan loss provisions when the downturn came in 2008.<\/p><p>It was always acknowledged that IAS 39 was pro-cyclical and would give rise to significant additional provisions in a downturn.  The scale of these additional provisions would reflect the scale of the downturn as it occurred.  When the downturn came in 2008, AIB was not permitted by IAS 39 to make impairment provisions for all of the losses it was forecasting for subsequent years.  It was for this reason that AIB disclosed to the market, in its investor presentation in February 2009, that it expected to book further losses of between &euro;4.6 billion, base case, and &euro;6.7 billion, stress case, in 2009 and 2010 as the Irish economy further contracted and property prices further declined.  These estimates were based on models and assumed a contraction of the economy in 2009 of between 5.5% and 7% and a peak-to-trough decline in property values of between 20% to 50% excluding land, and 30% to 80% for land.  It is now known that the economy contracted by over 10% in 2009 and certain categories of property, such as land, became almost worthless.  As a result the actual losses recorded by AIB in 2009 and 2010 were much greater than the forecasts.  Finally on this issue I would add that financial regulators can require banks to hold additional capital to absorb losses that could arise in a downturn.  This was done in some jurisdictions such as Spain and Canada.  Regulators may also do this in the downturn to reinforce confidence, and that was done in Ireland in 2011.  <\/p><p> Chairman, I'd just like to make a few comments on the liquidity and solvency of AIB in 2007 and 2008.  At each year end, our audit team was required to consider whether the going concern basis of AIB's financial statements was appropriate.  In performing the 2007 year-end audit in early 2008, we were concerned about the effect of worsening financial markets on the liquidity and funding position of the bank.  AIB prepared a detailed going concern paper in early 2008, and based on this and AIB's liquidity plans, KPMG was satisfied with the going concern basis.  One year later, when it came to our 2008 year-end audit, our audit team had very significant concerns in relation to both liquidity and solvency of the bank.  These concerns arose for a number of, from a number of factors.  There was great uncertainty in Ireland and the economy was contracting rapidly, AIB was forecasting losses of up to &euro;8.5 billion between 2008 and 2010.  It had agreed to take &euro;3.5 billion from the Government in preference shares.  The position in relation to the availability of emergency liquidity access from the Central Bank and the Eurosystem was not at all clear.  In early 2009, we informed AIB that we needed to take additional steps on the going concern issue and engage with the regulator, the Central Bank and the Government as part of our 2008 year-end audit completion process.  Confirmation and clarification was sought of our understanding of the public statements made by the Minister for Finance in relation to the Government's support for AIB.  This was provided to the AIB audit team at meetings held in February 2009 with the head of banking supervision of the Financial Regulator, with the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the assistant secretary general of the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> The onset of the global financial crisis was a shock to all of us.  The worldwide financial system broke down and regulators and Governments were forced to take unprecedented steps in response.  In my role as lead audit partner in AIB, I experienced some of these challenges first hand.  From mid-2008, the KPMG team knew that the 2008 audit of AIB was going to be the most difficult we had ever done.  Based on the Irish and international environment at the time, there were factors at play on this audit that were without precedent.  In the face of these challenging circumstances, our audit team and AIB, in late 2008 and early 2009, worked tirelessly to deal with those issues.  We brought all of the global expertise and local expertise of KPMG to bring to bear, and all of our personal energies to bear in completing and ensuring that the audit was in compliance with the required standards, both for the bank and for us.<\/p><p> Chairman, to conclude my opening statements I would reiterate that the AIB financial statements in each of the years, relevant years, was prepared in accordance with IFRS and Irish law.  KPMG audited AIB in accordance with our statutory duty and auditing rules.  The directors of AIB had a legal obligation to prepare accounts that gave a true and fair view and fulfilled this obligation.  We formed an audit opinion that AIB's accounts gave a true and fair view.  The accounting rules and the related laws did not, in our view, contribute to the banking crisis in Ireland.  However, as I said at the outset, there are important lessons to be learned by the accounting profession from the crisis and I would be happy to give my views on some of these to the committee if it considers it helpful in its questioning.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":971,"content":"<p>Thank Mr. Dobey and thank you Mr. O'Rourke for your earlier statement.

CARB, as part of its ongoing regulatory responsibilities is reviewing the audits of the covered institutions for the financial years ending 2008 and, where relevant, 2009.  The purpose of these reviews was to determine whether the auditors applied appropriate procedures and complied with relevant standards in the audit work carried out on the provisions for impairment as part of the firm's audit of the financial statements as a whole.  CARB's review is not yet concluded.  On their conclusion, CARB will prepare and issue a public report, in accordance with its governance procedures, which will outline the overall results of the reviews conducted without naming specific firms.  Conclusion has been reached in relation to our firm and we have received a report on AIB.

And indeed, the directors, including the chairman, and the directors, signed the financial statements and approved them in the belief, I believe, that they gave a true and fair view.  So, the first part of your question, I don't believe that the application of IFRS negated the true and fair view.  In actual fact I believe the true and fair view was informed by IFRS, and our opinions state that the accounts give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS, which is an explanation of what the true and fair view is.  The true and fair view must be informed by some rules because, your true and fair view and my true and fair view ... they'd be a different true and fair view by individuals, it's a pretty broad term.  So it's ... it's explained by reference to accounting standards.  So that's the first and very important, point.  And ... and if I believed that AIB were saying that they didn't believe the accounts gave ... gave a true and fair view that would be something, that would be significant.  I don't believe that's the case.  I'm aware, though, of the views of AIB in relation to IFRS, and I was aware at the time.  There was an extensive dialogue in AIB around the application of IFRS.  One of the issues in IFRS ... the reason why IAS 39 was introduced in relation to loan loss provision was to stop income smoothing.  And there was a very significant debate around income smoothing in, in the US actually, in 1998, when chairman Levitt of the SEC outlawed earnings management.  And there was a very significant dialogue between the SEC and the Fed in the US, that went on for ... for three years until it eventually resolved in 2001, what, yes, 2001, that the incurred loss model prevailed.  And the issue here was, that the Federal Reserve, like regulators, for example, would like to have significant buffers in their general provisions, by general provisions to enable banks, maybe, to report less volatile earnings.  The Fed might like that there would be more buffers and provisions to smooth earnings, because that encouraged confidence, it avoided volatility.  What the SEC were very focused on was to make sure there wasn't earnings management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#OO02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>Okay.

The benefits of accounting standards is that they are objective and what .... IAS 39 was certainly a very objective standard.  It tried to remove any subjectivity, in other words, people deciding, well, it's ... we'll put away this amount this year, and this amount another year.  And the problem beforehand was that people were putting away different amounts in different places, so analysts, in trying, and investors trying to understand the financial statements of banks were coming up with different answers.  When IAS 39 came along, the benefit was you knew that the only things that were provided for were incurred losses.  Now, there is , I mean, there is, we grew up with the concept of prudence in banking and prudence was this concept of putting away more money but there is another side to the coin, which is the objective, and it's good to have objectivity as well.  I think what ... this debate has now moved on, the IASB are moving towards an expected loss model.  But it was one of the things about an expected loss model, is you only provide for expected losses, you don't provide for unexpected losses.  It's still got to be done on the basis of evidence of credit deterioration.  So, expected loss is not providing for unexpected loss then, it's not back to the old general provisioning, we just put away whatever we think we should put away.  And therefore I think there, there was definitely merit in IAS 39 and I think where we're getting to now is probably a more sensible situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#OO03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>In Donal Forde's evidence, also, previously, when he was asked, \"Did you express that view to anybody?\", about the standard, he replied, \"it would have been a point of discussion with our external auditors\", and I continue, in Michael's Buckley's evidence, when asked did he recall expressing these concerns to the regulator he stated, \"a lot of these discussions we would have had with the auditor\".

I mean, one of the things, I think, more dialogue with the regulator along the way through.  I mean, we did report every year to the regulator as required but the new protocols now of the regulator are to meet more regularly to have dialogue with the regulator and to discuss ... make sure each side knew the other.  The regulator is also constrained.  In some meetings we did have with the regulator, the regulator was unable to tell us things.  We'd tell the regulator something and they said, \"We can't tell you anything back because we're constrained by confidentiality\".  Now some of those confidentiality rules have been lifted, so there's a more open dialogue now between regulator and auditor which, I think, is important.<\/p> <p>  A couple of other things, one is the going concern basis and the basis on which banks decide that they are a going concern, there is now agreement there should be extensive disclosures of what the issues the directors took into consideration when they're making those things.  The guidance, for example, previously would have focused on liquidity and now it's very clear that going concern decisions should be based both on liquidity and solvency.  Also, the previous guidance on going concern was more about a point-in-time, intermittent, \"Are we a going concern today when we do our accounts?\".  And now the view is that this should be a matter of constant ... under constant attention by a company and they should be looking to make sure they're a going concern at all times.  So, those things are helpful.<\/p> <p>  And finally, I would say in audit reporting, we now see that audit reports which are boilerplate ... they were beforehand, there was a lot of things we had to say but they were pretty much the same things we said to everybody.  Now, auditors are required to identify the major risks that they have identified, so that in their published audit report to shareholders to say, \"These are the things that we think could give rise to most risk of the accounts being wrong and this is why we think those things are the biggest risks.\"   We also ... Auditors also use materiality, in other words, we don't audit every last penny because we'd be there forever if we .... so we take a material ... and make sure everything is materially right, whether the balance sheet is &euro;100 million or &euro;99.9 million, it doesn't make much difference but if it was &euro;90 million it would be a big difference, so there's a materiality aspect and auditors now have got to disclose in their audit report what materiality judgments they use.  And, finally, auditors have got to now to say in their audit report in a bespoke way what they've done in terms of the major risks they identified - so, what audit work have they done to work on the major risks.  So, those are now published and are in the audit reports of public interest entities and are a new feature which was not there in the crisis.  So, all those are helpful, I think, for readers----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#PP01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>And finally, you said KPMG audited PostBank, HSBC, Defpa, INBS, AIB, EBS at one stage or now ... sorry ... currently, PTSB and BOSI at one stage also.

I'll try.  So, in 2004, we would have been talking about strong credit in the economy.  We would have been talking about economic conditions and competitive pressures that could exacerbate profitability caused by increased competition and falling margins.<\/p> <p>  In 2005, we talked about continued credit growth and demand in AIB's markets, particularly in Ireland.  We talked about a risk that credits might deteriorate post-approval and policies are not reviewed to reflect the changes in economic environment which could adversely affect credit quality.  Also in 2005, we highlighted the level of exposure to different economies and sectors.<\/p> <p>  In 2006, we highlighted significant and continued growth in the new business volumes and increased credit concentrations in the property sector.  At that time, there was increasing ECB interest rates and we were concerned about its impact on the Irish economy; that didn't end up being a big issue.  We talked about the competitive environment and we made a comment on the aggressive new entrants to the local market with an established infrastructure.  We talked about competition to secure long-term capital funding and we talked about the integrity of management information and financial reporting which was dependent on the effectiveness of internal control systems and the tension between that and the drive to maintain EPS momentum and control costs.<\/p> <p>  In 2007, things were getting a little more difficult.  We talked about the provisioning assumptions will require continuous monitoring and appropriate revision as credit grading policies and procedures develop.  The favourable credit environment in AIB's markets is reflected in the current provisioning levels.  However, as interest rate rises take effect and additional information becomes available, the provisioning may need to be updated to take account of the impact of any deterioration in the credit environment.  That was in late 2006, in the context of our 2007 audit.  We talked about underwriting in the current environment and breaches of underwriting limits.  We talked about the deterioration of credits post-underwriting approval, including the impact of current market turmoil.  We talked about credit rating and liquidity positions to support growth aspirations, the significance of the Irish economy to the group and its impact on generating sustainable growth, and we talked about the natural tension between maintaining the integrity of management information versus the ongoing drive to maintain EPS momentum.<\/p> <p>  And I can continue, if you wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#QQ01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>No, no, and I'm not wishing to cut you short, but I only have limited time and I've a whole series of questions that I wish to ask.

We would've preferred that they did it throughout the year, but it was done towards the end of the year.  There was a number of reasons why this was a practice we didn't ... we weren't particularly keen on.  Firstly, as I've mentioned earlier, in a bank, the closer the relationship manager is to the loan, the greater the risk.  So, in this instance, and the way ... the way banks manage that is by having approval processes and credit committees.  In this case, we would have liked to have seen where loans were being written off, and I'm not saying there was a fraud, but there is an increased risk of fraud between the borrower and the lender ... the lending ... the relationship manager ... and the bank's controls on that was to have all write-offs or provisions go through a credit committee.  There was obviously, I would say, a lot of work done towards the end of this particular year and credit provisions were processed.  We would've been happy that they were processed timely but we would have preferred if they'd gone through the credit provisioning process ... the credit committee process.  And one of the key... it's on the right hand side of that page ... one of the key matters ... what's really important about when credit provisions are taken is that there is learnings from that loan loss.  So, if you advance a loan and then you have to take a provision against it, the most critical thing from the bank's perspective is that you learn the lessons from that loan.  What was the problem?  Why did this loan go bad?  Was it the underwriting decision that was wrong?  Was it the management of the loan over the period or whatever, right?  So, as I said, the main purpose of the markup is to analyse the cause of the loss and to learn from our loss experience, in addition to confirming the appropriates of the provision.  So it was those two things that we were pointing out.  So you're absolutely right, this was something that we were, sort of, picking up and ... and improvements that we thought AIB could make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#VV01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>And in the management response then on the right hand side, that's AIB accepting your observation and recommendation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":1251,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>And is that then case closed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW00400","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":1253,"content":"<p>No, no the next year you would have looked at it again and we would have expected them to do it differently and to follow through on this recommendation.

One of the things, I'm not an expert in Spanish law, but it's different than Irish law.  So when the EU ... IFRS regulation was brought into Irish law it was brought in fully with no carve-outs, and we didn't have the option of having that carve-out that was available in Irish law, sorry, that was available in Spanish law, and I have to say I don't understand all the details around Spanish law.  I can say that the audit firms in Spain qualified the accounts of the Spanish banks to say that they were not in compliance with IFRS.  Now for AIB, given that it had access to ... European capital markets and US capital markets, it wanted to apply IFRS and wanted that opinion from its auditors and the market would have demanded its opinion from its auditors in relation to IFRS.   The other thing I can say is while, what was called dynamic provisioning was operated in Spain, it was only operated in relation to a small portion of its book and it was there for a particular reason, which I think was to do with holdings that Spanish banks held in Spanish companies.  And, all I can say as an observation is that the additional provisions that were set aside as a result of that were, were not sufficient to save the Spanish banks from the, the, the ... very significant issues that they faced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>Was the Spanish approach, or the carve-out as you described it, was that better practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW01400","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>Well, I have to take you back to the comments I made in my opening statements; if a bank thinks it needs more capital, it can hold capital.  It can decide not to pay dividends, we had that discussion earlier on.  It can decide to raise capital in the markets.  If the regulator thinks there's greater risk in the banks than they would like to see, they can specify that greater capital should be held against those risks.  So IFRS accounting is only one small piece in the picture here, and the other thing I should say to you; when general provisions are set aside by banks, they're not necessarily a buffer against capital because the capital adequacy rules, under the CRD are such that those loan loss general provisions get added back to capital.  So they're not available always as buffer.  Now they get ... it's technical but they get added back to tier 2 capital.

An audit is to assess the risks arising from the business model and strategies followed.<\/p><p>You then went on and you said, ''[The auditor] is required to form an opinion as to whether the consequences of those strategies and models are properly reflected in the financial statements in accordance with [regulations, essentially].  Now, you go on, \"While it is now clear that the business models and property-related lending strategies of the Irish institutions led to large losses being incurred, it was only when it became likely that property prices would decrease and that the economy would contract that the consequences of these were permitted to be reflected in the financial statements.\"  Now, does that suggest, Mr. O'Rourke, that you would ... you could have seen, and perhaps you did see, risks arising from the business models and strategies that you could have had perhaps serious concerns about those but that there was no mechanism for reporting that in a significant way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#DDD03400","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":1473,"content":"<p>The risks we identified in our audit of banks were ... we identified them, we talked to the audit committee about them, we evaluated them.

He noted that it was unlikely that the Government would support significant growth in AIB's overseas business or emerging businesses at the expense of providing funding to the consumer, mortgage or SME sector in Ireland[ which obviously was the priority for the Government].<\/blockquote><\/p><p>There was some discussion around the state of the banking system in Ireland, including some positive comments from Kevin Cardiff regarding the Government support for six banks, subject to the Government guarantee.

There's other things you need about a company, other than what its assets and liabilities are, what its income and expenditure are.<\/p><p>You need to know its business models more, you need to know its risks.  You need to be able in some way to measure the environmental impact of a company.  You need to be able to measure the social impact of a company.  And therefore there's a lot of work being done on can we develop corporate reporting on top of a very sound basis of the numbers being done in a certain way, can we give other information to people that'll help them better understand a business and the risks it face?  That work is being done by the international integrated reporting council I talked about.  It's being done by the financial stability board of the bank of international ... or the BIS in Basel, which are coming out, enhanced disclosure task force, which again has got a lot of work done on the additional disclosures that banks should make of the risks they're running.  And there's now a fairly broad set of additional risk disclosures which are being developed and are being trialled with banks to see can they produce this information in an understandable and consistent manner.  And that work is going ahead very well.  I think in the future you'll see that banks will report a wider range of things, more than just the numbers.  So that looking back on the crisis you'll say, \"We believe the numbers were properly prepared in accordance with the rules that were there.  The issue was: that was not enough for people to understand what was going on.\"  We need a wider picture, which can't all be captured in numbers.  They need to be captured in more narrative, telling the story in a broader sense.  And what ... to have that consistent so we compare Bank A with Bank B in different countries and different situations, there needs to be a fairly comprehensive set of things that banks can and can't do, and that work is ongoing at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#PPP03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1693,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you.
