Members can see the information on screen.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the matter raised by Deputy Costello, which I will deal with now rather than raise it later on, alongside that issue, a number of reports were given to us by a whistleblower relating to Cork Insitute of Technology.  I know this is a different matter but it is still part of the third level sector.  Then there were reports on Waterford Institute of Technology, there were problems in regard to the amalgamation of Carlow and Waterford ITs and Tralee and Cork ITs.  Within what was said at those meetings, there were serious issues which have not been addressed in an adequate way.  We should not just remind the Department of Education and Skills but, if necessary, bring forward the date of our hearing with it if we do not get the appropriate replies.  Extremely serious allegations were made but it seems to me that the Department has not taken them seriously.  <\/p> <p>  In the context of the amalgamation of institutes at both Carlow and Waterford and Tralee and Cork, significant moneys are involved and the Department has not clarified the matter yet the amalgamations continue apace.  Again, it is a question of having the information before us, being able to make a decision and not allowing a process to continue that will further cloud the financial circumstances of the colleges involved so that we will never get to the end of the matter.  We should express our concern directly to the Department about these matters that have been raised.  If we do not receive a comprehensive reply to the queries raised by members and whistleblowers, then we should have an earlier than planned meeting with the Department, the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the different colleges concerned.  Deputies could deal with the issues raised in the correspondence supplied by the Department at that meeting.  The allegations are far too serious for this committee to ignore. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#B00900","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I agree with the Chairman that we should bring forward the meeting with the Department.

There are a number of other outstanding matters that the executive has to deal with but this correspondence answers some of the questions raised.  In the context of the HSE reflecting on our meeting I suggest that we forward a transcript of that meeting to the Garda Commissioner in light of the issues raised separately, relating to the home in Waterford and other matters.  We are told the Garda is investigating.  It is extremely lax on the part of the HSE and the Garda that this matter is not being dealt with in a more open way.  On one side there are approximately 30 young adults who have been affected by what happened there, but I get no sense from the HSE that there is an urgency about this or any desire to resolve it.<\/p> <p>  The position is likewise in respect of the investigation into the procurement process.  That has not been rightly explained to us either.  Perhaps the transcript may be of help to the Garda.<\/p> <p>  A protected disclosure was made, under legislation, on more than one occasion from more than one person, but nothing has happened since.  The Garda Commissioner needs to understand that we have had our hearing, that protected disclosures have been made and that we would have expected a far greater urgency as a result of that meeting.  The care of these 30 or more individuals is a matter of concern to us.  Given all the reports undertaken into incidents within the HSE one wonders whether the executive is fit for purpose at all.  Perhaps the transcripts should also go to the Minister out of concern for the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#C00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>There is a good deal in this.  As you have said, one of the issues the committee dealt with has to do with procurement and tendering.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has carried out reports on the matter.  Across the board when it comes to the HSE it is clear that the executive is a bad actor, frankly, when it comes to tendering within public procurement guidelines.  When it comes to the issue that you have just raised and what the committee has dealt with in recent weeks, the appropriateness of hiring former HSE employees to do reports for the HSE on issues as disturbing as those we have been dealing with is questionable.<\/p> <p>  When Mr. O'Brien was before the committee and questioned with regard to the process whereby the tender was awarded, he pointed to some regulations that needed to be followed.  When he was questioned about whether they had been followed in that particular case and for the particular contract in question, it was clear that they had not because the procurement office said it had no communication with the HSE on the matter.  In hindsight the answer he gave was disingenuous.  We have done a great deal of work when it comes to this issue as well as the tendering of contracts by the HSE and the potential conflicts of interest that arise when former employees of the HSE get these contracts.<\/p> <p>  We should put a formal proposal from the committee to the Minister to change this arrangement.

The conflicts of interest that arise in these issues are incredibly disturbing and far supersede that consideration.<\/p> <p>  The premise is in place.

Rather than simply point out the position, we should come up with a solution.  I think we should come up with a clear determination, as a committee, about what should not happen when it comes to the issuing of a contract by the HSE.

It will appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning.  The stonewalling that goes on when one is trying to sort out a problem is just incredible.  It is unacceptable and somebody will have to do something about it.  My concern is that while we are discussing this and while we had our meeting with the HSE and are now going to bring forward this short report with recommendations, there are individuals out there who are suffering because of it and nobody seems to mind.  The system seems to be conditioned to a high level of acceptance of this stuff going on.  It is not acceptable.

Members of the committee may wish to note that the accounts do not include a balance sheet.  The accounts have a statutory purpose of providing an annual statement of Central Fund transactions on a cash basis and are not intended to be a comprehensive set of annual financial statements for the State or for central Government.<\/p> <p>  The national debt accounts, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and audited separately by me, are also presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.<\/p> <p>  The chapters from my Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2013 that are the subject of today's meeting were compiled to highlight key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and in broader State liabilities.  Chapter 1 summarises the Exchequer's financial outturn for 2013, when Central Fund issues exceeded receipts by &euro;11.5 billion.  Receipts into the Central Fund in 2013 totalled &euro;44.1 billion, an increase of 7% year on year.  Issues from the Central Fund amounted to &euro;55.6 billion in 2013, a decrease of 1% year on year.  Figure 1.1 shows the trends in issues and receipts from 2002, and the progress being made in closing the gap between them that emerged during the recession.  Some significant developments during 2013 which the committee may wish to note are an increase of approximately 28% year on year in the cost of servicing the national debt, which in 2013 amounted to &euro;7.5 billion; an increase of 24% year on year in Ireland's contribution to the EU budget, which amounted to &euro;1.73 billion in 2013; and payments of just over &euro;1 billion under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, following the winding up of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in February 2013.  These were mainly payments made to bondholders and depositors with IBRC, arising from protection provided under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2013, Ireland's general Government debt stood at approximately &euro;216 billion.  The debt represented 123% of Ireland's gross domestic product, compared with 117% a year earlier.  The principal component of the general Government debt at the end of 2013 was borrowing by the NTMA on behalf of the State, totalling &euro;197.5 billion.  This is referred to as the \"gross national debt\" and is accounted for in the national debt account.  It increased by &euro;36 billion or 22% during 2013.<\/p> <p>  A substantial part of the increase in the national debt in 2013 related to the extinguishing of the promissory notes issued in 2010 by the Minister for Finance to the predecessor institutions of IBRC.  These notes were not included in the NTMA's national debt accounting but were included within the definition of the general Government debt.  The promissory notes held by the Central Bank as collateral for lending to IBRC were replaced with floating rate Government bonds issued by the NTMA when IBRC was placed in liquidation in February 2013.  The new bonds form part of the gross national debt, accounting for 23% of the Government bond debt in issue at the end of 2013.<\/p> <p>  Medium and long-term debt at the end of June 2014 accounted for just over 90% of the gross national debt.  Figure 2.3 presents a maturity profile of this debt, which indicates that, at that date, approximately &euro;100 billion falls due for repayment or refinancing in the period up to and including 2020.  Funding received under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland accounted for over one third of medium and long-term debt.  Since the publication of my report, Ireland has repaid &euro;9 billion of EU-IMF funding ahead of schedule, with the agreement of other programme lenders.  The Accounting Officer can update the committee further on this.<\/p> <p>  As I said, Exchequer payments in 2013 related to servicing of borrowing undertaken by the NTMA were approximately &euro;7.5 billion.  The NTMA estimated that the weighted average cost of servicing the gross national debt was just under 4% at the end of June 2014.  At that date, around 88% of the debt was at fixed rates, including debt where hedging had been undertaken.  The balance of the debt was at floating interest rates.<\/p> <p>  Cash and other financial assets held by the Exchequer totalled &euro;23.6 billion at the end of 2013, rising to &euro;25.4 billion at the end of June 2014.  High levels of cash balances had been maintained since the beginning of the financial crisis and the Accounting Officer can update the committee on the level of balances held currently.  In the past, the bulk of Exchequer cash balances were held in the form of deposits with the Central Bank.  In contrast, by the end of June 2014, only around 19% of the total was held as cash on deposit in the Central Bank.  The rest of the assets were held in a variety of forms, including short-term bank deposits with commercial banks, non-Irish treasury bills and instruments called tri-party reverse purchase agreements with financial institutions.  Such investments typically earn a higher rate of return than the interest on Central Bank deposits, but they also carry a higher risk.<\/p> <p>  While the form in which Exchequer balances are held has changed significantly, with greater investment in higher yielding and higher risk instruments, the average return on Exchequer balances is still lower than the average cost of borrowing.  This means that there is a cost to the Exchequer associated with holding high levels of cash balances.  The Minister for Finance has not set a specific monetary limit for the level of cash and financial assets maintained by the NTMA.  At the time of my report, the NTMA stated that its aim was to maintain these balances at a level high enough to cover at least 12 months' Exchequer funding requirements.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the 2013 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records expenditure totalling &euro;27.3 million on five programme areas, up from &euro;26.2 million in 2012.  The programme areas relate to the costs incurred in respect of European Union and international policy; financial services policy; fiscal policy; and economic policy and provision of shared services.  The expenditure on financial services policy recorded in the appropriation accounts is &euro;9.6 million.  However, it should be noted that this is not the full cost of the financial services policy function, because it does not include costs associated with staff who are seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.<\/p><p>These costs are borne by the NTMA and not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs incurred on these services is not disclosed in either the appropriation accounts or the NTMA's financial statements.  At the end of 2013 the Department had underspent by &euro;8.6 million, which amount was, accordingly, liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

In addition to speaking to the issues and items on the agenda, I propose to touch briefly on some of the things we have done within the Department during that time.<br\/><br\/>The first item on the agenda is the 2013 appropriation accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2013 was set at &euro;33.187 million.  The spend was &euro;24.6 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered of approximately &euro;8.6 million.  The savings arose in three main areas: banking related consultancies, in respect of which there was a saving of &euro;3 million because of cost-sharing with the industry and the later than anticipated timing of national payments plan projects; non-administrative pay budget costs, in respect of which some &euro;2 million in savings were recorded because economies had been achieved in our EU Presidency work, while certain IT infrastructure projects such as ePQ and eSubmissions systems were undertaken in-house rather than being contracted out; and budgets provided to enhance external and international engagement which had been completed using internal and cross-departmental resources or funded by the receiving organisation.<br\/><br\/>Since 2013, the Department has operated within reduced budgets of &euro;31.2 million and &euro;30.6 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  This reflects a number of key changes, including the transfer of some staff to the shared payroll services in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It also reflects the ongoing focus on cost control, having regard to appropriate resource allocation in the context of wider deliverables in the Department.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the other three items on the agenda which are Exchequer focused, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the following key statistics.  Tax revenues increased from &euro;37.8 billion in 2013 to &euro;41.2 billion in 2014.  That trend is continuing in 2015, with tax revenues for the first four months at &euro;12.8 billion, or 4.2%, above the expected profile.  The Exchequer deficit fell to &euro;8.2 billion in 2014 and we are forecasting that it will drop to about &euro;3.5 billion by the end of the year.  We expect to move toward a balanced budget by 2018.  On general Government debt, the debt as a percentage of GDP is projected to drop to 105% in 2015 from a peak of 123.7% in 2013.  We project that this downward trend will continue and that by 2020 we will be well below 90%.  All of these trends are very positive and encouraging.<br\/><br\/>After a number of very difficult years, the economy is showing signs of recovery and the medium-term prospects are bright.  Budgetary policies continue to focus on the need to reduce public debt and, within this, to generate sufficient funding for public services and boost the growth capacity of the economy.  A modest recovery in the economy has been under way since 2011, but it has gained momentum in the past 12 or 18 months.  We are seeing improvements in domestic consumption, people have more confidence and are willing to spend and, for the first time since the crisis, made a positive contribution to economic growth in 2014.  We expect this to continue.  Much of the competitiveness lost during the boom has been recovered.  Unemployment, while still high, has fallen by 5 percentage points and is set to fall below 10% in the coming months.  The number in employment has grown by 95,000, or 5%, from its lowest point.  The Department forecasts that employment lost during the downturn will be recovered by 2018.<br\/><br\/>The improvement in the public finances goes hand-in-hand with the improvements in the economy.  The general Government deficit has fallen from a peak of 11.5% in 2009 to an estimated 2.3% by the end of this year.  Gross Government debt has peaked and fallen.  We expect to get to a rate of around 100% of GDP by the end of 2016.  Appropriate fiscal policies will continue to be necessary to ensure deficit and debt levels maintain their downward trajectory.  The recently published spring economic statement clearly signals that this can be achieved within the fiscal rules, allowing for a modest increase in expenditure, balanced by a focus on taxation measures, while still complying with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The spring economic statement is an important development and reform in how we budget.<br\/><br\/>Tax policy is one of the core functions of the Department.  For several years we have been reforming and modernising the way we develop tax policy advice.  Central to this is much greater emphasis on open public consultation processes which lead to better evidence based policy making.  The contributions of all stakeholders, interest groups and individual members of the public are welcome as part of this process and carefully assessed.  We are using public consultations more and more across the entire Department as a way of improving policy outputs.  Last year there were seven separate public consultations on tax policy, ranging from the OECD BEPS project all the way through to agricultural taxation expenditures.  This year there will be three additional consultations on the knowledge development box, the local property tax and the taxation of zoned but undeveloped land.  To ensure policy proposals are robust, we introduced in 2015 new tax expenditure guidelines to assist with <i>ex ante <\/i>and <i>ex post<\/i>evaluations of expenditures.  A workshop was held for all Departments and State agencies to set out the requirements of the new guidelines, which will have to be followed when tax expenditures are proposed.  The Department has also initiated an annual tax policy conference, now in its third year, at which more than 150 stakeholders, academics and policy makers discuss tax policy issues.  Papers on topical issues which are examined by the tax strategy group in advance of the budget have always been published and provide a very good source of data and a narrative from the Department across all tax heads.<br\/><br\/>Work continues on a wide range of challenging issues within the banking and financial sector.  The investment by the taxpayer in the banks has been unprecedented, totalling over &euro;64 billion.  This investment comprised &euro;34.7 billion in Anglo Irish Bank-INBS and &euro;29.4 billion in the three viable banks of AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB.  Our objective in the Department is to help recover as much and preferably all of the money the taxpayer invested in these living banks.  Over the course of the past two years major steps have been taken to reduce the overall cost of recapitalisation.  The liquidation of IBRC and the replacement of the promissory note by floating rate bonds in February 2013 reduced the gross borrowing requirement of the State in the next decade by some &euro;20 billion.  The sale of debt investments in Bank of Ireland, the sale of Irish Life and the repurchase of the contingent capital notes by PTSB have led to the return of around &euro;5.5 billion to the State in the form of capital receipts.  In addition, some &euro;5.9 billion has been received in interest and fees across all of the banks.  The preliminary independent valuation of the State&rsquo;s equity and preference shareholding in AIB, recently completed by the NTMA, stands at &euro;11.7 billion.  The State also holds &euro;1.6 billion in convertible capital notes in the bank.  Our equity investment in Bank of Ireland, based on current market prices, is approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  That brings the total current value of the State&rsquo;s investments to over &euro;16.1 billion, including its equity investment in PTSB.  We are confident that over time the aggregate funds the State has invested in the three banks will be recovered.  PTSB has recently announced that it has raised &euro;525 million, a significant milestone in its recovery.  As part of the raising of capital, the State will recoup &euro;509 million in capital receipts from the sale of shares and the repurchase by the bank of the contingent capital notes invested in by the State as part of the 2011 recapitalisation of the bank.<br\/><br\/>The success of the liquidation of IBRC to date has far exceeded expectations at the time of the promissory note transaction in 2013.  In October 2014 the debt acquired by NAMA as part of the promissory note transaction was fully repaid.  The success of the loan sales process removes any residual risk of further calls on the Exchequer.  To February 2015, the second anniversary of the liquidation, &euro;16.5 billion in cash inflows had been generated.  This has allowed for the payment of &euro;14.7 billion to IBRC creditors and resulted in a cash balance of &euro;1.85 billion, which ultimately will be available for distribution to creditors, including the State. <br\/><br\/>The international financial services strategy commits us to protecting and enhancing the competitiveness of the funds industry.  The Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Act 2015 is an important step towards that goal.  There is a strong linkage between a number of work streams within the Department and the IFS2020 strategy launched in March.  We are fusing these together to ensure we can fully support this important Government initiative and deliver on our commitments in the strategy actions.<br\/><br\/>There has been a suite of interventions designed to address the issue of mortgage arrears, including specific Central Bank targets, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the recasting of personal insolvency legislation, the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and the mortgage-to-rent scheme.<\/p><p>It is a positive development to be able to report that the number of mortgages in arrears is declining year on year, although the issue of longer-term arrears remains a big challenge.  For example, according to Central Bank data, the number of principal dwelling house accounts classified as restructured at the end of 2014 stood at 114,674, an improvement of 29% on the number of restructured accounts for the same period in 2013.  As members will be aware, further enhancements were announced by the Government yesterday in terms of bank vetoes in the insolvency process, further resources for Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and changes to the mortgage-to-rent scheme.<\/p><p> At the end of 2014 NAMA had redeemed a total of &euro;16.6 billion of senior bonds, which represents approximately 55% of senior bonds issued.  NAMA is confident, assuming current market performance is sustained, that it will be in a position to fully repay its borrowings and hopes to achieve a surplus over its lifetime, thus eliminating the State&rsquo;s contingent liability.<\/p><p> Turning back to the Department, we have placed a high emphasis on resources in the past few years, including the upskilling of staff through a continuous training programme and an improvement in information systems that are integral to our day-to-day business.  This is and will be a continuing process.  In the past year the executive board and I have concentrated on three areas - learning and development, the structure of the organisation and governance.  The Department of Finance is a knowledge-based organisation and our people are our most important asset.  As an organisation, we must always seek to ensure staff have the requisite skills for the job, complemented by our investment and focus on performance management, the enhancement of our IT systems, employee engagement, workforce planning and learning development.  These developments are managed and led by our senior management team and actively contributed to and supported by our staff.<\/p><p> The learning and development strategy 2014 to 2016 was published in October 2014.  It is aligned with our business needs and plays a crucial role in supporting the organisation.  It is a living document that will change as the needs of the Department change.  Strategies for learning include building skills capability through effective training and the development of a learning culture within the organisation; developing talented staff through bespoke training; continuously acquiring new knowledge and skills; and learning and improving from experience.  For example, consistent with our overall emphasis on learning and development in the Department, a comprehensive technical tax training initiative has been put in place for departmental staff through a strategic training partnership with the Irish Tax Institute, as has a training initiative on project management, leading to the award of both a diploma and international accreditation.  The Department is very proud to have been shortlisted, in the top three, for the best learning and development organisation in the Irish Institute of Training &amp;amp; Development awards 2015.  It intends to build further on this initiative, particularly in the context of benchmarking our learning against industry standards.<\/p><p> Our organisational structure derives from our core job of providing policy advice for the Minister and the implementation of Government decisions.  For the purposes of day-to-day management, we have significantly simplified the structure of the Department by creating two directorates - an economics and fiscal directorate and a finance and banking directorate.  Within each there are a number of divisions.  The economic and fiscal directorate reports directly to me and is focused on economic, budget, tax and international engagement.  As Accounting Officer, corporate affairs, HR and departmental finances also fall within my remit in this directorate.  The second directorate focuses on finance and banking, including credit, lending, EU and domestic financial legislation, shareholding management, risk, legal and compliance matters and engagement with international financial institutions.  This directorate reports to Ms Nolan in her role as second Secretary General.  She also acts as deputy to me in the overall management of the Department.  This change meets one of the key recommendations made in the Wright report.<\/p><p> My other objective has been to enhance and promote good corporate governance and compliance within the Department.  Work has just been completed on a governance framework for the Department, the purpose of which is to provide a clear and comprehensive summary for all staff of how we work within the Department.  It ensures a framework of structures, policies and processes are in place to deliver on our obligations.  It is envisaged that the governance framework will be further developed over time and have regard to implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan which will inform any update in the future.  The codification of the governance framework for the Department, its roll-out to all staff and the embedding of its principles in how we do our work are important developments.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the work and contribution of all the staff of the Department.  The progress we have made would not have been possible without them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Moran's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#H00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Moran and his officials.

The public is listening to us and everything in the country has supposedly changed.  However, while we have not concluded our banking inquiry into what happened seven or eight years ago, we are now finding that we are conducting another inquiry into a bank we own.  Somebody might ask the question: \"What is worse governance wise?\"  Was what happened in the 2000s in banks we did not own and of which there was no oversight and regulation worse?<\/p><p>The answer is that that was worse, given the devastation caused to our country and people.  Technically, though, what is worse in governance terms is that we are holding an inquiry into a bank that we owned.  That is how I will premise my comments.  If the Department of Finance technically does not have a remit over the investigation of alleged insider trading, I am not sure whether it is sufficient to assert that that was not the Department's job.  The Department had oversight of IBRC.  The State owned it.  When the media reported an alleged spike in share activity, did anyone in the Department contact the Stock Exchange, the Garda or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE?  If the answer is \"No\", we have a problem.  If someone robs my house, I go to the Garda and make a statement.  A Deputy has made a request of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  His office's answer was that it wondered whether it had a remit in this area.  We have an issue with the process when it comes to the investigation of alleged insider trading.

I am a former employee of KPMG and it is a good organisation.  I know the rates they charge.

We will move on and agree to disagree on the independence issue.<\/p> <p>  I hate to say it but Mr. Moran's wording was very clever and accurate but nicely confusing to the public.  He made it very clear a minute ago, and rightly so, technically correct but giving the wrong impression, that the cost of this would not have to come out of any voted expenditure.  In his opening statement to us an hour ago with regard to IBRC, he said the liquidation has resulted in a cash balance of &euro;1.85 billion which ultimately will be available for distribution to creditors including the State.  What he is actually saying is it will come out of taxpayers' money because the State is the taxpayer.  He is saying any cost that comes out of this extra inquiry will come out of the amount available for distribution to the State.  That is in his opening statement and it is accurate.  He also said a minute ago that the cost of this inquiry will not come out of any voted expenditure.  That is also accurate.  If the people of Ireland, whom we are here to represent, listened to what he said a minute ago they would think this cost will not be voted in some way by the people because he said it would not come out of voted expenditure.  I must highlight he said a half an hour ago it will come from any distribution available to the State and the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is paying for this through the amount of funding that will come back as a result of the distribution.  A lower distribution will now be available to the taxpayer and the State because of the cost of this, and we still do not know to the nearest million how much it will be.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the Chairman for the time I have taken on this point.  I expected a straight-up answer in this day and age on how much it will cost.  I was expecting to be told it was commercially sensitive, but I expected somebody somewhere to have a cost.<\/p> <p>  The essence of what Deputy Deasy said about Siteserv was a relationship framework was in place since 2009.  In the documents we received during the week Mr. Moran stated IBRC received further significant levels of State support and ultimately began pursuing an orderly wind-down strategy in accordance with the joint restructuring and work-out plan for IBRC dated 31 January 2011 which was approved by the European Commission and EU state aid rules.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran said he had a busy year, and everyone is busy, but the public will be disappointed that a decision was made on 31 January 2011 but it was 15 months later before the Department of Finance came back.  The revised framework was all under Mr. Moran's control.  Under the revised framework, the new arrangement states that representatives of the Minister can attend board meetings in an observer capacity.  Had the Department of Finance been doing its business in 2011 or earlier than that, the Minister would have had the right to have an observer at all the board meetings in 2011, long before the Siteserv deal was on the agenda.  The revised agreement also stated the Minister was entitled to be notified of any information he reasonably required.  All of this could have been in place long before the Siteserv deal came in.  It was in the ability of the Department of Finance to do that.  What is even more worrying from what Mr. Moran said a few minutes ago is that, ultimately, the troika put a deadline on it.  He said the troika had in its third review that this was to be done by the final quarter of 2011 and that it slipped to the first quarter of 2012.<\/p><p>Even if the troika had not been in town, the Department of Finance should have done this in a more expeditious manner.  If it had done so, that revised framework agreement would have been in place 12 months earlier than it was.

The first mention I remember of a possible liquidation of IBRC was in the very beginning of September 2012, when there was an initial discussion involving the Department and the troika members, on a very small scale, about whether we could replace the promissory note with long-term bonds if IBRC were liquidated.  If IBRC were liquidated, the promissory note would be left in the hands of the Irish Central Bank.  The ECB was extremely unhappy with it having it, we would volunteer to swap it for long-term bonds and the bank would be liquidated.

In October 2014, the debt acquired by NAMA as part of the promissory note transaction was fully repaid.  The success of the loan sales processes negated the need to transfer any assets to NAMA as part of this process and removed any residual risk of further calls on the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  It is important to put on the record also that loans of par value of &euro;21.7 billion have been prepared, brought to the market and sold.  Among other assets, loans with a par value of &euro;3.6 billion remain, which the special liquidator is to continue to manage.  To 6 February 2015, the second anniversary of the IBRC liquidation, &euro;16.5 billion in cash inflows have been generated.  This has allowed for the repayment of &euro;14.7 billion to the IBRC&rsquo;s preferential creditors and to meet costs to date.  This has resulted in a cash balance of &euro;1.85 billion, which will ultimately be available for distribution to creditors.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we put this in the context of the questions I will ask.

It will take time to work through but it has been a very positive thing.  Notwithstanding that, we must always be cognisant of the fact that the liquidation of the bank means we are pretty much not getting back the money that went into Anglo Irish Bank.  One has to recognise that on the other side of the balance sheet.  Some &euro;34 billion went in and it was liquidated.  In terms of getting money back, the Department is working towards getting back the money it invested in the other banks, the living banks.  It has been a successful project, however.  There will be creditors for that &euro;1.8 billion, with small amounts going back to local authorities, and larger amounts coming back to ourselves through the ELG and through the settlement of a range of issues.

On 6 October Mr. Cardiff became the Government's nominee to the European Court of Auditors to commence in February 2012.  The closing date for the receipt of applications for the position of Secretary General was 24 November.  On 21 December Siteserv's stock closed unchanged at 2 cent.  On 31 December Siteserv's stock hit a 52-week low of 1.5 cent.  On 31 January 2012 it closed unchanged at 1 cent.  In January 2012 the first media reports surfaced that Siteserv could be sold for less than its &euro;150 million debt.  On 15 January the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>reported that Davy and KPMG were seeking a new owner for Siteserv, that it would be sold at a significant discount on its bank debt of &euro;150 million and that a bidding process was already under way.  The shareholder stock was almost at zero and it was unlikely any payment would be received.<\/p><p>In early 2012 there were 12 bids for Siteserv.  On 2 February Mr. Cardiff officially left his post and on 22 February Siteserv's stock increased by 0.9 cent or 45% for the second consecutive day.  On 22 February Siteserv's stock crashed.  On 28 February it soared to 0.5 cent.  On 1 March the Secretary General left his post having been appointed to the European Court of Auditors.  On 6 March <i>The Irish Times<\/i>carried a report on the new Secretary General, Mr. John Moran.  It was stated Mr. Dukes had said he had had private conversations about a wish to join the IBRC board shortly before he became Secretary General.

Will Ms Nolan look at the amount of paperwork in the Department related to the concerns that were expressed about transactions by officials within the Department?  Consideration must be given to the fact that if a business is purchasing from IBRC it is up to the business to get the best deal possible, but it is up to IBRC and the Department's officials to ensure that taxpayers' interests are looked after.

The Department then went on to raise issues about various sales.  Its position was that a number of governance concerns had arisen from a particular incident and it was concerned about the fact that a matter about a member of the senior management team was not addressed or communicated to the board.  There were concerns about the simple transaction of communication not taking place between management and the board.  IBRC was ignoring everything to do with good governance, with no respect for taxpayers' money and the Department&rsquo;s involvement in the process, and just proceeded at speed.  All of this happened at a time when the Department had expressed concern about the manner in which certain transactions were being completed.  In fact, in the note on other business conduct concerns, it was stated the Department was concerned about the number of transactions that had been poorly executed under the direction of the current CEO and that the performance of management in executing these transactions raised a question about the effectiveness of the CEO.  Having made such a statement in the context of a private and confidential briefing document, I would have expected the Department to move decisively to correct the imbalance in the role being played by IBRC and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#DD00500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":610,"content":"<p>We did do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>It was too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#DD00700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":612,"content":"<p>The meeting was held at the end of July and we had someone from the Department in IBRC by 1 October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#DD00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>That was after the event.

It was imperative to know how a bank that was State-owned was operating and how it was dealing with what were effectively State assets.  The excuse given was related to the very conservative viewpoint of the commission when it came to commercial independence.  I do not accept this and the Department should not have accepted it.  There should have been far greater ongoing scrutiny when it came to the operation of IBRC which, as the Chairman said, pretty much ignored the Department for a number of years.  It took a member of the public to contact the Department.  Only when that member of the public contacted it did it act.  That is the problem.  The Department then had to react and figured out that the decisions being made at senior levels within IBRC were questionable.  That is where we are.  Ultimately, what happened was that the Minister and the Department questioned and were given assurances by IBRC at a meeting that everything that had taken place was above board and carried out properly.  There was no scrutiny from day one.  The Department's attitude towards oversight within IBRC was coloured by an acceptance of the commission's very conservative viewpoint.  That is where the mistake was made and there needs to be an acceptance of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#EE00400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":652,"content":"<p>When we look back on how the collapse happened - we all have a view on it and it is being worked out at another committee - there was a lack of information, a taking of things for granted, a bit of bullying here and there and pressing on by the banks.  That culture of pushing the Department around was alive and well.  We did not have enough strength from the taxpayers' and the Department's point of view to simply take them on and put a stop to what they were doing.  There is still a lot of that culture in forcing any of the other banks to deal with the real issues in terms of mortgages, debt or support for businesses and so on.  Until such time as we take the bull by the horns and deal with the issue, we will be dealing with this type of thing day in and day out.  As part of the Department's restructuring - Mr. Moran mentioned this in his opening statement in terms of the quality and qualifications of the people involved and so on - it might be no harm if it got a few hard-nosed individuals from the private sector to attempt to deal with the banks because they are still out of control.  They are almost back on their feet and as soon as that happens, God help the rest of us.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran gave the figures for KPMG hourly rates, which ranged from &euro;95 to &euro;295 an hour.  Will he give us the numbers of people employed at these rates?  Does the Department have ten people on &euro;95 an hour or is it more at the upper end of the scale quoted?  If Mr. Moran does not have the figures available, will he, please, make them available to us as soon as possible?  How many hours have they clocked up to date?  Surely the Department knows that figure.  We clock in and out here every day.  I am sure the Department gets KPMG staff to clock in and out on a regular basis and that it has someone keeping an eye on them.  Can Mr. Moran give us a breakdown of the figures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#EE00500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":653,"content":"<p>To date, the liquidation has cost approximately &euro;76 million, but I will get a breakdown for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#EE00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>The sum is &euro;76 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#EE00700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#EE00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Will Ms Nolan also give us a breakdown of the number of individuals and the various rates involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#EE00900","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I will supply whatever detail I can to the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#EE01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>To finish this matter from my perspective, the reason I asked the question about the media reports when it came to a spike in share activity was to find out if there was an active level of consideration about all of the events that had affected Siteserv dating back to 2011 and 2012.

There is a question of State aid when using State money or the strategic investment fund for particular infrastructure in regional airports, but the Department did not rule it out.  It did not rule out projects that did not come within the scope of the 2015-19 regional airports programme.  Beyond that, there was a possibility of its being used for that purpose.

The &euro;34 billion or &euro;35 billion that the taxpayer has put into the banking system, mainly into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, was in effect a write-down the taxpayers did to save the banks.  The officials might give us a breakdown of that between what went to the corporate business sector and what went for write-downs of personal mortgages.  I have a feeling it all went to business.  How does Mr. Moran see the proportion?  Very little of it seems to have gone for individual mortgage holders compared with the corporate end of things.

My understanding was that NAMA had a 57% write-down on the debts that were transferred to it and on the impaired assets.  When officials from NAMA came before the committee, their statement was that they expect to make a profit or at least to break even.  NAMA has also said it intends to complete its transactions more quickly than the allocated time in the legislation.  I think they expect to do it by 2018 instead of 2020.  With the recovery in the market and comparing what the sale of certain assets was a couple of years ago to what is happening now, would it be better for NAMA to delay and go the full term that is allocated under legislation?  What is the officials' advice to NAMA?  The very recovery that is taking place is raising the value of the assets they have, which were previously impaired.  Instead of shortening the time, perhaps we should be thinking of lengthening it.  That might provide a better return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015051400002#JJ03600","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":813,"content":"<p>We have looked extensively at the question of what is optimal in our discussions with NAMA last year and this year.  While there are competing factors within the system, it would be fair to say that the elimination of all those contingent liabilities has been one of the big successes for Ireland Inc. and the overall economy in the 18 months since we left the programme.<\/p><p>The issue concerns the elimination of all these contingent liabilities.  We were having difficulty in borrowing, not just because of the level of our debt which was big but also because it was perceived by the market, regardless of whether we liked it, that the residual IBRC was a weight on the Irish taxpayer because of the guarantee.  The guarantee in the case of NAMA was also perceived as a weight on the Irish taxpayer.  The fact that NAMA has repaid the best part of 60% of its debt and IBRC has repaid all the Government-guaranteed part of its debt is a big factor in how the market has recovered.  The question of a further overhang always has to be balanced with the benefit to be gained; there is a benefit to be gained in getting rid of it as well as in holding on to it.<\/p><p> We have looked at strategic areas where a long-term investment and State involvement would be particularly useful, the main one being the housing market in the big cities where NAMA has the capacity to build houses that the rest of the system does not seem to be able to deliver.

Mr. Chairman, I have provided a written statement to the inquiry on the topics you raised with me and I would like this morning to make a few general points.<\/p>  <p>  The first, and to me the most important point, I would ask the inquiry to bear in mind that my role as non-executive governor or chairman of Bank of Ireland ended in July 2005, just under ten years ago and I have absolutely no involvement with the bank in the intervening decade.  Whilst I am anxious to assist the inquiry as much as I can and do not wish to appear in any way unhelpful, the truth is my recollection of events, of meetings and correspondence is significantly impaired by the passage of time.  It happens to all of us and I trust the inquiry will understand and accept this.  I note that a lot of the documents you have sent me relate to periods after I left the bank and I hope you will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment in any way on these documents.<\/p>  <p>  The second point I would like to make concerns the standards of governance and oversight in the bank during my time there.  Most of the board, including myself, were non-executive and therefore part-time.  It is not the job of non-executives to run the bank nor are they or can they be expected to know everything that is going on in the bank.  Their role is an oversight one, to approve strategy and general direction and to be satisfied that there are proper governance structures in place.  In looking at historical practices, whether in banking or anywhere else, I believe that these practices should be judged against the standards of best practice which existed at that time.  There is no doubt that corporate governance has evolved significantly over the last decade, both generally for public companies and specifically for financial institutions in the light of the financial crisis but in my view, a fair assessment of practice in the past requires them to be judged in the context of standards of best practice at the time concerned.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the structure which was in place in Bank of Ireland during my time there reflected best practice and I have summarised the main control processes which existed in my written statement.  I had no cause for concern about the adequacy or appropriateness of the reporting and the accountability structures which we benchmarked against practice at the time, with the help in particular of our internal auditors and our external auditors.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the strategy of the bank approved by the board in 2002, it is clear that this was an ambitious growth strategy.  <\/p>  <p>         It must be viewed, however, in the context of the economy at the time which was growing rapidly and with all indications pointing to a long period of sustained growth.  What is also important to note is that the strategy was not reliant on property lending.  My recall is that the growth in the balance sheet was to be achieved through a combination of acquisitions, particularly in life and pensions businesses, and through managing the capital of the bank through share buy-backs and other mechanisms.  We were particularly focused on growing the business outside Ireland and that was largely why we recruited a CEO who had been working abroad.  My understanding from reading the materials you have sent to me is that, in fact, property lending did not grow in a disproportionate fashion compared to other lending in Bank of Ireland and this would be what I would have expected from my experience there.  <\/p> <p> In my written statement in relation to the subject of property lending, I say that I do not recall any issue of imprudent lending being brought to the board.  I understand that this statement by me has been put to one of the other witnesses.  I was not intending to suggest that executives were aware at the time of imprudent property lending and chose not to bring it to the board.  I'm completely satisfied that this is not the case.  There was always open dialogue between the board and the executives and I have no doubt that if there was a material issue relating to property lending, the board would have been informed.  Of course, the board were aware that the bank, like all banks, had bad debts and I recall that the bank was conservative in making provisions for bad debts.  While some of the bad debts may well have related to property lending, I have no reason to believe that this was a result of imprudent or reckless lending.  <\/p> <p> Finally, in relation to property lending, I've seen references to the establishment of a specialist property group in the bank in late 2004, the implication being that this is evidence of a decision to place a particular emphasis on property lending.  I don't believe that the reason for the decision was to significantly increase the level of property lending.  It was part of a move towards specialisation, where individual lenders would focus on particular areas, rather than have someone who might be lending to a property developer in the morning and a grocer in the afternoon and I believe that this was a sensible approach.<\/p> <p> Can I conclude by coming back to what is the role of a director?  For as long as I've been involved in business, it has always been the case that the primary duty of a director is to act in good faith in what he or she honestly believes is in the best interests of the company involved.  I understand that this principle has now been enshrined in legislation in the new Companies Act, recently passed by you and your colleagues in the Oireachtas.  I genuinely believe that everything I and other directors of Bank of Ireland did during my time was done in good faith in what we believed was the bank's best interests.  I believe we discharged our responsibilities to the best of our ability.  When, as I was leaving ... when I was leaving the bank in 2005, it was operating in a very strong economic environment and there were no signs that the bank would do anything but go from strength to strength.  If, with the benefit of hindsight, decisions taken during my time later contributed to the problems facing the bank, then this is clearly something I regret.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laurence Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":833,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Crowley.

As requested by you, I submitted a written statement on a number of specific topics identified by you.  I do not propose today to repeat all of the points made in my written statement, but I do want to highlight a number of points which I believe are of particular relevance to the business of the inquiry.  Looking at events from a number of years ago, it's important to try and recall and to understand the context in which actions were taken or decisions were made.  <\/p>  <p>         This is particularly so in circumstances where the banking world has changed so dramatically in the intervening period.  Before touching on some of the points made in my written statement, let me make a few brief words about the backdrop against which Bank of Ireland and other banks operated during my time on the board.<\/p> <p> Peter Nyberg's evidence to the inquiry described that the global consensus back in the noughties was that financial markets were stable and efficient, a view to which Irish private and public sector decision makers adhered.  A number of previous witnesses before the inquiry have referred to the general economic backdrop to the early 2000s, including the strong growth in employment, the extraordinary growth in the Irish population and the consequent huge increase in demand for new housing.<\/p> <p> The report by Regling and Watson, which forms part of the evidence presented to the inquiry, notes that Ireland's strong and extended expansion during the previous decade fostered expectations of a continued rise in living standards and in asset values.  Regling and Watson also note that in this macroeconomic setting, bank governance and financial supervision faced major challenges and, looking back, I would agree with this observation.  They described banks operating in a setting of greatly increased wholesale funding opportunities following the adoption of the euro and banks from abroad beginning to compete strongly in retail mortgage lending.  Another factor highlighted by Regling and Watson was that when modern Ireland ... was that modern Ireland had never experienced a property crash.  As the chief economist of Bank of Ireland set out in his written statement to the inquiry, the fall in house prices in the first half of 2008 was modest and the full effect of the unprecedented collapse of the global credit markets which followed the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008 was not felt until 2009.  So the 2008 crisis was not primarily caused by the property devaluation but by other factors, later exacerbated by the collapse of property values.<\/p> <p> I was asked to discuss the quality of the business model setting process in Bank of Ireland, which I took to mean the quality and setting of the strategic plans.  In my view, a key point to bear in mind when making judgments on a strategy setting process is the backdrop against which the strategy is developed.  Bank of Ireland's strategy was informed by the consensus view on likely economic developments in the countries in which the bank was most exposed to credit risk.  While I believe that the process for setting the bank's strategy was extensive and robust, in hindsight the bank's strategy, in common with other financial institutions in Ireland and internationally, which assumed continued economic growth in the bank's main markets, reflecting the consensus view, led the bank to expand in a manner which, as I said at the extraordinary general meeting of the bank in March 2009, was regrettable.  The bank's funding of that growth assumed the continued normal functioning of wholesale interbank markets, which did not happen, and the risk of this funding not being available was not, in light of our perception of future events at that time, fully appreciated.<\/p> <p> While prudent strategic decisions were made to focus on the bank's core business, and not to enter into certain business segments, which meant that Bank of Ireland's position, when compared against many of its peer companies, was less severe overall, this was of little consolation to the bank's shareholders, who suffered a very serious decline in the value of their shares and through the cancellation of dividends.  <\/p>  <p>         At the extraordinary general meeting in March 2009, I also acknowledged that the bank's change of strategy, to a much more defensive position, was not commenced early enough in the cycle of the economic decline.  Reports commissioned by the bank in the period following the crisis have noted that while the bank could not have escaped the unusually severe economic downturn, the effects could have been mitigated if corrective action had been taken earlier.<\/p> <p> As I said at the time and at the AGM in July 2009, I accept responsibility and accountability as governor for the situation in which Bank of Ireland found itself in 2008.  I also placed clearly on the record then, my appreciation of the Government actions in 2008 and 2009, which ensured the survival of Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p> I&rsquo;m referring to the guarantee, which stabilised the situation in September of 2008, the capital infusion into Bank of Ireland, since, thankfully, fully repaid and the creation of NAMA and its acquisition of the banks property loans, which allowed Bank of Ireland to become an investable institution and thus allowed new, third-party shareholders to come aboard.  This package of support was comprehensive and determined the continued viability of the bank.  I have outlined in my written statement, the structures which were in place in Bank of Ireland in relation to risk monitoring.  A key issue in my view, is that despite these structures, we the board and management did not fully appreciate nor factor in the risk inherent in the rate of growth of the bank's core businesses and in particular, while property lending grew broadly in line with other lending, the risks arising from the absolute amount of property lending and from the group's reliance on wholesale funding.<\/p> <p> In hindsight, risk should have been a more fundamental driver of the setting of strategy.  This would have resulted in a set of constraints around strategy development reflecting the risk appetite being set down by the board.  I do not believe that the appetite for property lending in Bank of Ireland was any greater than for lending into other sectors.  In particular, Bank of Ireland had a relatively lower appetite for, and by extension, lower relative exposure to, landbank lending than other banks in the Irish market.  So, while the growth in property lending was not disproportionate, the amount of the bank's property and construction book was significant and thus the bank was heavily exposed to the significant downturn in the Irish and UK property markets.<\/p> <p> I have seen from the previous evidence sought by the inquiry that the members have a strong interest in analysing the decision to introduce the bank guarantee on the night of 29 September 2008.  You have asked for my opinion on the appropriateness of that guarantee and in response, I would say that there is no doubt that the Government at the time found itself in an extraordinarily difficult situation, particularly on that night of 29 September, when it became clear that a liquidity default risk facing Anglo Irish Bank could have serious implications for the entire banking system.  I am not aware of the range of options considered by the Government at the end of September 2008 and I am not, therefore, in a position to comment on the appropriateness of the guarantee as against those other options.  I would say that in my view, the immediate funding requirements of Anglo Irish Bank could have been addressed by guaranteed financial support, which Bank of Ireland and AIB were prepared to make available in the short term to Anglo Irish Bank.  <\/p>  <p>         Such a decision may have given the Government more time to consider its options.  However, the Government chose to go further and to guarantee all financial institutions, which certainly avoided the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank that week.<\/p> <p> Let me conclude these remarks by repeating that it was a source of great regret to the board of Bank of Ireland, which had served its stakeholders so well for over two centuries, that we required substantial support from the Irish taxpayer and from the State.  As I've said earlier, that support was comprehensive and ensured the continuing viability of the bank, and for that I remain very grateful.  I'll do my best to answer any questions which you may wish to raise, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Burrows","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Burrows, and thank you very much for your earlier comments, Mr. Crowley.

Mr. Burrows and Mr. Crowley, welcome.  Can I go to document Bank of Ireland - Vol. 1, B2, and the page I'm looking at is page 89.  It's effectively to do with stress testing.  It's dated 3 April 2006, addressed to Mr. Liam Barron, who was with the Central Bank.  And the question I suppose I want to ask is that your sensitivity analysis appears to have very much revolved around mortgages versus non-mortgages.  Did ye look at different type of stress testing ... the correlation between property being ... the type of property, whether it was commercial development land, speculative landbanks, and how it was being financed?  And when you're dealing with that, Mr. Burrows, could you also address that on page 90 you speak about the projected ... when you're looking at the general  ... that your sensitivity analysis ... the projections assume capital raising in the years '06-'07, '07-'08 and '08-'09 of the order of about &euro;4.3 billion.  And you said ... if the funding was not raised with \"Shock 1 Scenario\" that you basically would just be meeting your minimum regulatory capital requirements.  Did ye raise any of that money by way of capital?  And, just the sensitivity analysis ... it doesn't appear to have gone into any great depth.  And what type of reduction in falling property values did ye factor into your sensitivity analysis, in worst case scenario?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#W03800","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>First of all, during that period we were heavily engaged in the implementation of the Basel II regulations, which were the new regulations that required us to have a different approach to assessing the amount of capital required to be appropriately capitalised for the business which we were doing.  And in that ... in that calculation, the mortgage loans were actually the least risky under the Basel II methodology, whereas other loans carried various rates.  So that would have been the background to a lot of the work which was being done in assessing the comparative risk of different elements of the balance sheet.<\/p>  <p>  If I ... if I go to the second part of your question, we didn't raise fresh capital during the period but of course we were generating capital through the ordinary profit and loss of the ... of the business.  That's the way businesses generally do generate capital where your ... you're earning profits after tax, you're paying part of that as dividend to your shareholders and the remainder you're adding to your capital base within the business.

On page 16 of the same document - the last sentence on that page - it's stated that \"Mr. Goggin was going to explore a capital injection by the State\".  When did Bank of Ireland first explore the idea of a capital injection by the taxpayers?

That was the regulator's concern.  And the reply is on the following page 8.  They say that they would only do so, the Bank of Ireland would only do so in exceptional defined circumstances.  And they'd already written to the Central Bank twice in 2001 and 2002 to notify them of that.  And then they go on and say, \"...we were fully compliant with our stated procedures...\".

As managing partner of KPMG from 2006 to 2013, I welcome this opportunity of discussing with you the role of KMPG as auditors in the period you're looking at.  I have provided a written ... a detailed written witness statement in response to the themes identified by the committee.  These themes include the integrity of financial reporting and the impact of prevailing standards in recognising risks.  In this brief opening oral statement I will deal with a number of matters in that witness statement, specifically the role of an audit, the purpose of financial reporting and the basis of the accounting standards used in financial reporting, the going concern issue when preparing accounts, and, finally, I'll speak briefly about changes in these areas since 2008, which might have contributed to the avoidance of the crisis like the one we've gone through.<\/p>  <p>  Personally, I've spent all my professional life in KPMG since joining in 1975.  I was a partner from May 1988 to April 2013.  I was head of audit from May 2004 to December 2006, which also involved participation in a number of financial institution audits, including a role on the AIB audit.  I held the position of managing partner from December 2006 to April 2013.  I've not held an active role within KPMG since retiring as managing partner in April 2013 but the firm has provided support and assistance to me in preparing for today, and I confirm that, in particular, I have consulted with, and received input from, Mr. Paul Dobey, who's also here today, and who was the lead partner on the AIB audit.<\/p>  <p>  I'd, firstly, like to discuss the purpose of financial statements and the role of the external auditor, as there can be misunderstandings in relation to what an audit actually is and what certain commentators think or would like it to be, particularly in relation to the strategy and risk appetite of an entity.  The management of an entity is responsible for the preparation of its financial statements.  The overall responsibility for financial statements rests with the board.  The role of the audit is to provide a report to shareholders on those financial statements.  In reporting on whether the accounts present a true and fair view, auditors do an extensive amount of work in checking and verifying the systems producing the accounts as well as the financial information that is presented.  Those who prepare the accounts and the auditors who audit the statements must comply with an extensive framework of technical rules known as financial reporting standards and auditing standards.  These standards are set by independent international bodies, apply currently in some 280 jurisdictions, and are underpinned by national and by EU regulation.  The objective of having clearly defined financial reporting and auditing frameworks, standards and rules is to provide uniformity, consistency and transparency to the users of financial statements.  Without such rules, it would be very difficult to ensure the level playing field ... to ensure a level playing field in comparing the results and financial positions of companies across the world and the quality of audit reports on the accounts of those companies.  As far as KPMG is concerned, our work was carried out in accordance with our quality control framework for performing high quality audits and we believe that the accounts of the financial institutions we audited were prepared in compliance with the relevant international standards and that KPMG audited those accounts in accordance with their statutory duty and the auditing rules.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I'd make the following two points.  Financial statements are a point-in-time record of financial information of an entity, including its results.  By definition, financial statements are a record of past financial performance and do not seek to forecast or predict future performance.  An audit opinion, which deals with whether accounts give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS, does not assure, for example, the long-term success or sustainability of the business model of an entity nor the effectiveness with which management has conducted its affairs.  <\/p>  <p>         This responsibility rests with the management and boards of the entity.<\/p> <p> I would like briefly to discuss the accounting rules which make up the financial reporting framework.  From 2005 onwards, the rules that applied to Irish financial institutions was the set of international financial reporting standards known by the acronym IFRS.  The IFRS was developed by the International Accounting Standards Board, IASB, through a formal system of due process and broad international consultation involving the accounting profession, investors, governments, regulators and other interested parties.  IFRS seeks to ensure that financial statements provide consistent information about the financial position, past performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to those making economic decisions.  The adoption of IFRS in 2002 across the EU was endorsed with an overwhelming majority vote in the European Parliament and IFRS has force of law in Ireland by way of statutory instrument.<\/p> <p> The auditing framework applicable to the audits of the financial statements of Irish institutions was the auditing and assurance pronouncement issued by the UK's Financial Reporting Council, a body independent of the auditing profession.  The use of this framework is part of the statutory licensing regime for auditors in Ireland.  The directors of our financial institutions which audit clients thus had responsibility for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS from 2005 onwards.  It was, and remains, KPMG&rsquo;s view that the financial reporting of the relevant institutions was conducted in accordance with the requirements of IFRS.<\/p> <p> The KPMG teams performing bank audits during the relevant period were experienced in the application of auditing standards in IFRS and had an in-depth understanding of the banking sector.  These teams monitored emerging best practice through their connection with fellow KPMG firms in Europe and the US.  These audit teams had particularly close ties with our UK firm and were, therefore, familiar with best practice in the UK market and how the accounting and auditing standards were being applied there.<\/p> <p> One of the most significant accounting standards impacting the Irish institutions was IAS 39, and its requirements regarding the recognition of provisions for loan losses.  My colleague, Paul Dobey, will deal with the issues arising from the fact that IAS 39 is based on an incurred rather than an expected loss model.<\/p> <p> I said earlier that accounts were a point in time, and that the numbers that auditors reported on were historic and thus backward looking.  There is one matter however that falls to be considered in preparing a set of accounts that is forward looking, and that is the going concern basis of preparation.  This means that every year, when preparing the annual accounts, the directors of the company or a bank are required to consider whether they believe the entity will be in operational existence for at least one further year.  Typically directors make that assessment based on forecasts, budgets and an evaluation of the risks that the business faces.  Auditors are then required to assess whether directors' judgments and conclusions are reasonable and whether it is appropriate for the accounts to be prepared on the going concern basis.<\/p> <p> Up to and including 2006 year end, the assessment of our audit teams, based on the economic assessments and forecasts of respected bodies, was that the going concern basis of preparation of the banks&rsquo; financial statements was appropriate.  The additional steps taken by our audit teams in respect of the subsequent years, in light of the unprecedented economic conditions, will be dealt with by Mr. Dobey.<\/p> <p> KPMG is very conscious of and acknowledges the significant adverse impact which the banking crisis has had on our society, our people and our clients.  We recognise the important work of the joint committee in looking at the systemic issues involved in the crisis and more important, in identifying steps that might be taken to avoid a repeat.  KPMG is committed to and is assisting in this process, in particular in relation to further developing audit and corporate and financial reporting standards to reflect the lessons learned from the crisis.<\/p> <p> And so the final issue I want to address are the changes in financial and reporting standards since 2008.  In light of the global financial crisis the International Accounting Standards Board, the IASB, completed a review of what changes might need to be made to accounting standards.  This review considered the lessons learned across more than 100 jurisdictions in which the IFRS had applied by 2008.  The IASB's post-crisis review confirmed the important role of financial reporting in providing unbiased, transparent and relevant information.  However, it also recognised that only so much can be expected of accounting.  The IASB noted, and I cite the IASB chairman who said, that accounting standards could contribute to financial stability, but they should not be expected to provide a veneer of stability by ignoring volatility when it is really there.<\/p> <p> The most important conclusion of the review, however, was probably that there should be a more forward looking impairment model for loan loss provisions.  It is only recently, after much debate and lots of transatlantic dialogue, that the IASB has agreed a new revised loan loss provisioning model that specified an expected rather than incurred loss model for loan loss provisioning.  This standard should permit the earlier recognition of loan losses.  As a result, it will be possible to recognise expected losses in the downturn when there is evidence of expected impairment.<\/p> <p> Apart from the issue of how losses are recognised, a more wide ranging debate is also under way globally regarding how corporate reporting can be improved.  One body, the International Integrated Reporting Counsel, a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standards setters and the accounting profession, is examining ways in which to better set out in an integrated report what is happening in a business in more than just financial terms.  Such an integrated report would be a concise communication about how an organisational strategy, governance, performance and prospects in the context of an external environment, is intended to lead to the creation of value in the short, medium and long term.<\/p> <p> To conclude, I have sought to give the committee an overview of the context of which financial statements are prepared and audited, the legal framework within which that work is done and some developments in standards since the crisis.  Mr. Dobey will address now, in more detail, how these principles and standards were applied now in the case of AIB.

And thank you for the opportunity to give evidence to assist the committee in its very important work.  I am here specifically in view of my role as lead partner on the AIB audit from 2005 to 2008.  I'll make some high level comments on the lines of inquiry dealt with in detail in my witness statement.  Specifically, I will explain why it is KPMG's view that the AIB financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and Irish law.<\/p>  <p>  KPMG audited AIB in accordance with our statutory duty and the auditing rules.  The AIB accounts gave a true and fair view and the accounting rules and related laws were not a contributing factors to the banking crisis in Ireland.  Notwithstanding this, there are important lessons to be learned for the accounting profession from the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  AIB was a large and complex organisation with over 25,000 employees in 2008 operating in Ireland, the UK, Poland and the US.  AIB had a very experienced board of directors, and an audit committee drawn from a wide range of disciplines.  The board oversaw the implementation of the strategy.  The audit committee oversaw the internal control and financial reporting of the bank.  The AIB accounts are very complex and expertise was required to make sure the transactions, balances and disclosures in these accounts were complete and the accounting was in accordance with IFRS.<\/p>  <p>  The KPMG audit team, which comprised approximately 20 partners and over 200 managers and staff, had the expertise to deal with these matters.  The team applied the best practice auditing and accounting standards to the bank's published accounts.  A quality review partner for KPMG UK and an SEC reviewing partner from our US firm was also involved in the AIB audit, bringing a further international perspective.<\/p>  <p>  As Mr. O' Rourke has outlined, AIB was required by EU and Irish law to comply with the IFRS accounting rules.  Similarly, KPMG was required to carry out its statutory duties as auditors in accordance with Irish law and the relevant auditing rules which were international standards on auditing.  The AIB team took all the necessary steps to form an opinion that the AIB accounts gave a true and fair view.<\/p>  <p>  The financial statements set out AIB's exposure to each sector, including the property and construction lending.  KPMG is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately disclosed the banks property related lending exposures.  AIB was aware of the risks arising from these business strategies, but like other financial institutions, did not anticipate the scale of the adverse circumstances which would give rise to unprecedented loses.<\/p>  <p>  AIB had an extensive risk infrastructure and semi-annual risk reports were presented to the AIB board by the chief risk officer.  These reports dealt with the top ten risks facing AIB, including credit risk, operational risk, market risk and liquidity risk.  The risk relating to credit and liquidity featured with increasing prominence in these reports in the period from 2005 to 2008.  As Mr. O'Rourke has mentioned, there is a common misunderstanding in relation to the role that an auditor plays regarding the strategy and risk appetite.  For KPMG to have sought to determine AIB's business strategies would have been beyond our role and expertise as auditors, and would undermine our ability to give an independent auditor's report on the financial statements of our audit clients.<\/p>  <p>  What KPMG did do, was to identify and report the risks to the AIB audit committee in the context of our audit work in order to ensure that the financial reporting implications were properly reflected in the financial statements.  Our consideration of these risks, and the audit findings on other communications with the AIB audit committee, were circulated to the Financial Regulator at the end of each audit.<\/p>  <p>  Turning, if I may, to the integrity of financial reporting.  The most relevant standard for loan loss provisioning was IAS 39 which required the use of an incurred loss model.  This model has been criticised because, in order to avoid smoothing of profits which was and is considered undesirable, it did not allow banks to create or hold general provisions in the good years to offset problems in the bad years.  It is the view of KPMG that the operation of IAS 39 was not a contributing factor to the issues which AIB faced in 2008.  I am not saying that IAS 39 was perfect, we have learned from the crisis that it needs to be changed and Mr. O'Rourke has outlined some of the steps being taken in this regard.  The major shortcoming of IAS 39 was that it delayed the recognition of the loan loss provisions when the downturn came in 2008.  <\/p>  <p>         It was always acknowledged that IAS 39 was pro-cyclical and would give rise to significant additional provisions in a downturn.  The scale of these additional provisions would reflect the scale of the downturn as it occurred.  When the downturn came in 2008, AIB was not permitted by IAS 39 to make impairment provisions for all of the losses it was forecasting for subsequent years.  It was for this reason that AIB disclosed to the market in its investor presentation in February 2009 that it expected to book further losses of between &euro;4.6 billion, base case, and &euro;6.7 billion, stress case, in 2009 and 2010 as the Irish economy further contracted and property prices further declined.  These estimates were based on models and assumed a contraction of the economy in 2009 of between 5.5% and 7% and a peak-to-trough decline in property values of between 20% to 50%, excluding land, and 30% to 80% for land.  It is now known that the economy contracted by over 10% in 2009 and certain categories of property such as land became almost worthless.  As a result, the actual losses recorded by AIB in 2009 and 2010 were much greater than the forecasts.  Finally on this issue, I would add that financial regulators can require banks to hold additional capital to absorb losses that could arise in a downturn.  This was done in some jurisdictions such as Spain and Canada.  Regulators may also do this in the downturn to reinforce confidence, and that was done in Ireland in 2011.  <\/p> <p> Chairman, I'd just like to make a few comments on the liquidity and solvency of AIB in 2007 and 2008.  At each year end, our audit team was required to consider whether the going concern basis of AIB's financial statements was appropriate.  In performing the 2007 year-end audit in early 2008, we were concerned about the effect of worsening financial markets on the liquidity and funding position of the bank.  AIB prepared a detailed going concern paper in early 2008, and based on this and AIB's liquidity plans, KPMG was satisfied with the going concern basis.  One year later, when it came to our 2008 year-end audit, our audit team had very significant concerns in relation to both liquidity and solvency of the bank.  These concerns arose for a number of, from a number of factors.  There was great uncertainty in Ireland and the economy was contracting rapidly, AIB was forecasting losses of up to &euro;8.5 billion between 2008 and 2010.  It had agreed to take &euro;3.5 billion from the Government in preference shares.  The position in relation to the availability of emergency liquidity access from the Central Bank and the euro system was not at all clear.  In early 2009, we informed AIB that we needed to take additional steps on the going concern issue and engage with the regulator, the Central Bank and the Government as part of our 2008 year-end audit completion process.  Confirmation and clarification was sought of our understanding of the public statements made by the Minister for Finance in relation to the Government's support for AIB.  This was provided to the AIB audit team at meetings held in February 2009 with the head of banking supervision of the Financial Regulator, with the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the assistant secretary general of the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p> The onset of the global financial crisis was a shock to all of us.  The worldwide financial system broke down and regulators and Governments were forced to take unprecedented steps in response.  In my role as lead audit partner in AIB, I experienced some of these challenges first hand.  From mid-2008, the KPMG team knew that the 2008 audit of AIB was going to be the most difficult we had ever done.  Based on the Irish and international environment at the time, there were factors at play on this audit that were without precedent.  In the face of these challenging circumstances, our audit team and AIB, in late 2008 and early 2009, worked tirelessly to deal with those issues.  We brought all of the global expertise and local expertise of KPMG to bring to bear, and all of our personal energies to bear, in completing and ensuring that the audit was in compliance with the required standards, both for the bank and for us.<\/p> <p> Chairman, to conclude my opening statements I would reiterate that the AIB financial statements in each of the years, relevant years, was prepared in accordance with IFRS and Irish law.  KPMG audited AIB in accordance with our statutory duty and auditing rules.  The directors of AIB had a legal obligation to prepare accounts that gave a true and fair view and fulfilled this obligation.  We formed an audit opinion that AIB's accounts gave a true and fair view.  The accounting rules and the related laws did not, in our view, contribute to the banking crisis in Ireland.  However, as I said at the outset, there are important lessons to be learned by the accounting profession from the crisis and I would be happy to give my views on some of these to the committee if it considers it helpful in its questioning.

Our firm is registered as a statutory audit firm by CARB.  CARB is subject to oversight by IAASA. CARB, as part of its regulatory responsibilities, carried out inspections of the firm's compliance with auditing standards.  CARB, as part of its ongoing regulatory responsibilities, is reviewing the audits of the covered institutions for the financial years ending 2008 and, where relevant, 2009.  The purpose of these reviews was to determine whether the auditors applied appropriate procedures and complied with relevant standards in the audit work carried out on the provisions for impairment as part of the firm's audit of the financial statements as a whole.  CARB's review is not yet concluded.  On their conclusion, CARB will prepare and issue a public report, in accordance with its governance procedures, which will outline the overall results of the reviews conducted without naming specific firms.  Conclusion has been reached in relation to our firm and we have received a report on AIB.  And I note what CARB have said is, audit work of the firm in relation to all of its financial institution audits complied with relevant auditing standards.  While there are a number of instances where improvements were recommended, these are not material.  Should further questions arise, for example, regarding improvements required, these are set out in detail in the firm's responses to the quality assurance committee.

And indeed, the directors, including the chairman, and the directors, signed the financial statements and approved them in the belief, I believe, that they gave a true and fair view.  So, the first part of your question, I don't believe that the application of IFRS negated the true and fair view.  In actual fact I believe the true and fair view was informed by IFRS, and our opinions state that the accounts give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS, which is an explanation of what the true and fair view is.  The true and fair view must be informed by some rules because, your true and fair view and my true and fair view ... they'd be a different true and fair view by individuals, it's a pretty broad term.  So it's ... it's explained by reference to accounting standards.  So that's the first and very important, point.  And ... and if I believed that AIB were saying that they didn't believe the accounts gave ... gave a true and fair view that would be something, that would be significant.  I don't believe that's the case.  I'm aware, though, of the views of AIB in relation to IFRS, and I was aware at the time.  There was an extensive dialogue in AIB around the application of IFRS.  One of the issues in IFRS ... the reason why IAS 39 was introduced in relation to loan loss provision was to stop income smoothing.  And there was a very significant debate around income smoothing in, in the US actually, in 1998, when chairman Levitt of the SEC outlawed earnings management.  And there was a very significant dialogue between the SEC and the Fed in the US, that went on for ... for three years until it eventually resolved in 2001, what, yes, 2001, that the incurred loss model prevailed.  And the issue here was, that the Federal Reserve, like regulators, for example, would like to have significant buffers in their general provisions, by general provisions to enable banks, maybe, to report less volatile earnings.  The Fed might like that there would be more buffers and provisions to smooth earnings, because that encouraged confidence, it avoided volatility.  What the SEC were very focused on was to make sure there wasn't earnings management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#OO02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1963,"content":"<p>Okay.

The benefits of accounting standards is that they are objective and what .... IAS 39 was certainly a very objective standard.  It tried to remove any subjectivity, in other words, people deciding, well, it's ... we'll put away this amount this year, and this amount another year.  And the problem beforehand was that people were putting away different amounts in different places, so analysts, in trying, and investors trying to understand the financial statements of banks were coming up with different answers.  When IAS 39 came along, the benefit was you knew that the only things that were provided for were incurred losses.  Now, there is , I mean, there is, we grew up with the concept of prudence in banking and prudence was this concept of putting away more money but there is another side to the coin, which is the objective, and it's good to have objectivity as well.  I think what ... this debate has now moved on, the IASB are moving towards an expected loss model.  But it was one of the things about an expected loss model, is you only provide for expected losses, you don't provide for unexpected losses.  It's still got to be done on the basis of evidence of credit deterioration.  So, expected loss is not providing for unexpected loss then, it's not back to the old general provisioning, we just put away whatever we think we should put away.  And, therefore, I think there, there was definitely merit in IAS 39 and I think where we're getting to now is probably a more sensible situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#OO03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1965,"content":"<p>In Donal Forde's evidence, also, previously, when he was asked, \"Did you express that view to anybody?\", about the standard, he replied, \"It would have been a point of discussion with our external auditors\", and I continue, in Michael's Buckley's evidence, when asked did he recall expressing these concerns to the regulator he stated, \"A lot of these discussions we would have had with the auditor\".

I mean, one of the things, I think, more dialogue with the regulator along the way through.  I mean, we did report every year to the regulator as required but the new protocols now of the regulator are to meet more regularly to have dialogue with the regulator and to discuss ... make sure each side knew the other.  The regulator is also constrained.  In some meetings we did have with the regulator, the regulator was unable to tell us things.  We'd tell the regulator something and they said, \"We can't tell you anything back because we're constrained by confidentiality\".  Now some of those confidentiality rules have been lifted, so there's a more open dialogue now between regulator and auditor which, I think, is important.<\/p>  <p>  A couple of other things, one is the going concern basis and the basis on which banks decide that they are a going concern, there is now agreement there should be extensive disclosures of what the issues the directors took into consideration when they're making those things.  The guidance, for example, previously would have focused on liquidity and now it's very clear that going concern decisions should be based both on liquidity and solvency.  Also, the previous guidance on going concern was more about a point-in-time, intermittent, \"Are we a going concern today when we do our accounts?\".  And now the view is that this should be a matter of constant ... under constant attention by a company and they should be looking to make sure they're a going concern at all times.  So, those things are helpful.<\/p>  <p>  And finally, I would say in audit reporting, we now see that audit reports which are boilerplate ... they were beforehand, there was a lot of things we had to say but they were pretty much the same things we said to everybody.  Now, auditors are required to identify the major risks that they have identified, so that in their published audit report to shareholders to say, \"These are the things that we think could give rise to most risk of the accounts being wrong and this is why we think those things are the biggest risks.\"   We also ... Auditors also use materiality, in other words, we don't audit every last penny because we'd be there forever if we .... so we take a material ... and make sure everything is materially right, whether the balance sheet is &euro;100 million or &euro;99.9 million, it doesn't make much difference but if it was &euro;90 million it would be a big difference, so there's a materiality aspect and auditors now have got to disclose in their audit report what materiality judgments they use.  And, finally, auditors have got to now to say in their audit report in a bespoke way what they've done in terms of the major risks they identified - so, what audit work have they done to work on the major risks.  So, those are now published and are in the audit reports of public interest entities and are a new feature which was not there in the crisis.  So, all those are helpful, I think, for readers----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#PP01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":1981,"content":"<p>And finally, you said KPMG audited PostBank, HSBC, Defpa, INBS, AIB, EBS at one stage or now ... sorry ... currently, PTSB and BOSI at one stage also.

I'll try.  So, in 2004, we would have been talking about strong credit in the economy.  We would have been talking about economic conditions and competitive pressures that could exacerbate profitability caused by increased competition and falling margins.<\/p>  <p>  In 2005, we talked about continued credit growth and demand in AIB's markets, particularly in Ireland.  We talked about a risk that credits might deteriorate post-approval and policies are not reviewed to reflect the changes in economic environment which could adversely affect credit quality.  Also in 2005, we highlighted the level of exposure to different economies and sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In 2006, we highlighted significant and continued growth in the new business volumes and increased credit concentrations in the property sector.  At that time, there was increasing ECB interest rates and we were concerned about its impact on the Irish economy; that didn't end up being a big issue.  We talked about the competitive environment and we made a comment on the aggressive new entrants to the local market with an established infrastructure.  We talked about competition to secure long-term capital funding and we talked about the integrity of management information and financial reporting which was dependent on the effectiveness of internal control systems and the tension between that and the drive to maintain EPS momentum and control costs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2007, things were getting a little more difficult.  We talked about the provisioning assumptions will require continuous monitoring and appropriate revision as credit grading policies and procedures develop.  The favourable credit environment in AIB's markets is reflected in the current provisioning levels.  However, as interest rate rises take effect and additional information becomes available, the provisioning may need to be updated to take account of the impact of any deterioration in the credit environment.  That was in late 2006, in the context of our 2007 audit.  We talked about underwriting in the current environment and breaches of underwriting limits.  We talked about the deterioration of credits post-underwriting approval, including the impact of current market turmoil.  We talked about credit rating and liquidity positions to support growth aspirations, the significance of the Irish economy to the group and its impact on generating sustainable growth, and we talked about the natural tension between maintaining the integrity of management information versus the ongoing drive to maintain EPS momentum.<\/p>  <p>  And I can continue, if you wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#QQ01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":2016,"content":"<p>No, no, and I'm not wishing to cut you short, but I only have limited time and I've a whole series of questions that I wish to ask.

We would've preferred that they did it throughout the year, but it was done towards the end of the year.  There was a number of reasons why this was a practice we didn't ... we weren't particularly keen on.  Firstly, as I've mentioned earlier, in a bank, the closer the relationship manager is to the loan, the greater the risk.  So, in this instance, and the way ... the way banks manage that is by having approval processes and credit committees.  In this case, we would have liked to have seen where loans were being written off, and I'm not saying there was a fraud, but there is an increased risk of fraud between the borrower and the lender ... the lending ... the relationship manager ... and the bank's controls on that was to have all write-offs or provisions go through a credit committee.  There was obviously, I would say, a lot of work done towards the end of this particular year and credit provisions were processed.  We would've been happy that they were processed timely but we would have preferred if they'd gone through the credit provisioning process ... the credit committee process.  And one of the key... it's on the right hand side of that page ... one of the key matters ... what's really important about when credit provisions are taken is that there is learnings from that loan loss.  So, if you advance a loan and then you have to take a provision against it, the most critical thing from the bank's perspective is that you learn the lessons from that loan.  What was the problem?  Why did this loan go bad?  Was it the underwriting decision that was wrong?  Was it the management of the loan over the period or whatever, right?  So, as I said, the main purpose of the markup is to analyse the cause of the loss and to learn from our loss experience, in addition to confirming the appropriates of the provision.  So it was those two things that we were pointing out.  So you're absolutely right, this was something that we were, sort of, picking up and ... and improvements that we thought AIB could make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#VV01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":2071,"content":"<p>And in the management response then on the right hand side, that's AIB accepting your observation and recommendation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":2072,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":2073,"content":"<p>And is that then case closed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW00400","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":2074,"content":"<p>No, no, the next year you would have looked at it again and we would have expected them to do it differently and to follow through on this recommendation.

One of the things, I'm not an expert in Spanish law, but it's different than Irish law.  So when the EU ... IFRS regulation was brought into Irish law it was brought in fully with no carve-outs, and we didn't have the option of having that carve-out that was available in Irish law, sorry, that was available in Spanish law, and I have to say I don't understand all the details around Spanish law.  I can say that the audit firms in Spain qualified the accounts of the Spanish banks to say that they were not in compliance with IFRS.  Now for AIB, given that it had access to ... European capital markets and US capital markets, it wanted to apply IFRS and wanted that opinion from its auditors and the market would have demanded its opinion from its auditors in relation to IFRS.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing I can say is while what was called dynamic provisioning was operated in Spain, it was only operated in relation to a small portion of its book and it was there for a particular reason, which I think was to do with holdings that Spanish banks held in Spanish companies.  And,all I can say as an observation is that the additional provisions that were set aside as a result of that were, were not sufficient to save the Spanish banks from the, the, the ... very significant issues that they faced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dobey"},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":2083,"content":"<p>Was the Spanish approach, or the carve-out as you described it, was that better practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#WW01400","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":2084,"content":"<p>Well, I have to take you back to the comments I made in my opening statements. If a bank thinks it needs more capital, it can hold capital.  It can decide not to pay dividends, we had that discussion earlier on.  It can decide to raise capital in the markets.  If the regulator thinks there's greater risk in the banks than they would like to see, they can specify that greater capital should be held against those risks.  So IFRS accounting is only one small piece in the picture here, and the other thing I should say to you; when general provisions are set aside by banks, they're not necessarily a buffer against capital because the capital adequacy rules, under the CRD are such that those loan loss general provisions get added back to capital.  So they're not available always as buffer.  Now they get ... it's technical but they get added back to tier 2 capital.

An audit is to assess the risks arising from the business model and strategies followed.  <\/p>  <p>               You then went on and you said, ''[The auditor] is required to form an opinion as to whether the consequences of those strategies and models are properly reflected in the financial statements in accordance with [regulations, essentially].  Now, you go on, \"While it is now clear that the business models and property-related lending strategies of the Irish institutions led to large losses being incurred, it was only when it became likely that property prices would decrease and that the economy would contract that the consequences of these were permitted to be reflected in the financial statements.\"  Now, does that suggest, Mr. O'Rourke, that you would ... you could have seen, and perhaps you did see, risks arising from the business models and strategies that you could have had perhaps serious concerns about those but that there was no mechanism for reporting that in a significant way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#DDD03400","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431558000,"counter":2294,"content":"<p>The risks we identified in our audit of banks were ... we identified them, we talked to the audit committee about them, we evaluated them.

There's other things you need about a company, other than what its assets and liabilities are, what its income and expenditure are.  <\/p>  <p>         You need to know its business models more, you need to know its risks.  You need to be able in some way to measure the environmental impact of a company.  You need to be able to measure the social impact of a company.  And therefore there's a lot of work being done on can we develop corporate reporting on top of a very sound basis of the numbers being done in a certain way, can we give other information to people that'll help them better understand a business and the risks it face?  That work is being done by the international integrated reporting council I talked about.  It's being done by the financial stability board of the bank of international ... or the BIS in Basel, which are coming out, enhanced disclosure task force, which again has got a lot of work done on the additional disclosures that banks should make of the risks they're running.  And there's now a fairly broad set of additional risk disclosures which are being developed and are being trialled with banks to see can they produce this information in an understandable and consistent manner.  And that work is going ahead very well.  I think in the future you'll see that banks will report a wider range of things, more than just the numbers.  So that looking back on the crisis you'll say, \"We believe the numbers were properly prepared in accordance with the rules that were there.  The issue was: that was not enough for people to understand what was going on.\"  We need a wider picture, which can't all be captured in numbers.  They need to be captured in more narrative, telling the story in a broader sense.  And what ... to have that consistent so we compare Bank A with Bank B in different countries and different situations, there needs to be a fairly comprehensive set of things that banks can and can't do, and that work is ongoing at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015051400002#PPP03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terence O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431558000,"counter":2514,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you.

It is a great pleasure to be here this afternoon.  I acknowledge the members of the diplomatic corps who are here this afternoon and who always have great engagement in the operations of the committee.<\/p> <p>  As the Vice Chairman correctly stated, I will brief the committee on the agenda for next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council, GAC.  I will also touch on the country-specific recommendations, which were published by the Commission yesterday.  Finally, as it is of particular interest to the committee, I will say a few words about the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.<\/p> <p>  First, I will turn to the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 19 May.  Ministers will consider two key issues: follow-up to the special European Council meeting of 23 April on migration; and initial preparations for the next meeting of the European Council, which takes place on 25-26 June.  In addition, Ministers will receive an update on a report on EMU reform, which is being prepared by the Presidents of the Commission, Euro summit, the ECB and the Eurogroup &ndash; the so-called four Presidents &ndash; and which is scheduled for presentation to the June European Council.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the GAC agenda is follow-up to the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in April.  As the committee will be aware, that meeting was convened in response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean, which has seen so many migrants lose their lives in tragic circumstances.  I am aware this committee held a special session on migration the following week, which was attended by the Italian ambassador, the UN Special Representative for Migration and International Development and the chief executive of the Immigrant Council of Ireland and that it is following these events closely.  Across the Union also, people have been shocked and horrified by the loss of life as migrants risk everything to reach European shores.  The immediate priority for the EU, its member states and third countries must be to better protect those in need and to save innocent lives.<\/p> <p>  The EU has acted swiftly since the situation began to worsen a month ago.  The first step was a special joint session of the Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils on 20 April, at which Ministers endorsed a ten-point action plan in response to the crisis.  This meeting was attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  Three days later, Heads of State and Government assembled in Brussels for a special meeting of the European Council.  At this meeting, a statement was adopted which set out commitments to try to stop human smugglers, strengthen the EU's naval presence in the Mediterranean, prevent illegal migration and reinforce solidarity and responsibility within the Union.  Shortly afterwards, the European Parliament adopted a strong resolution of its own, in which MEPs underlined the need for the Union to do more.  Clearly, there is real unity of purpose across the Union when it comes to tackling serious problems with respect to migration.  The focus now is on ensuring that the commitments set out at the European Council are backed by concrete action.  The General Affairs Council will review progress so far and look ahead to the next steps.<\/p> <p>  One key priority is the ramping-up of search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, in accordance with the welcome commitment made by member states to triple the budget for naval operations run by the EU's border agency, Frontex.  Another is targeting and dismantling criminal smuggling networks that operate in and around north Africa, and which are directly responsible for so much of the misery and suffering.  There is also a pressing need, as highlighted by the European Council, to enhance our co-operation with third states.<\/p><p>The Commission and Latvian EU Presidency are together monitoring implementation of the commitments set out in the European Council statement and will jointly update Ministers at the General Affairs Council meeting.  The Commission yesterday also adopted an ambitious European agenda on migration and I expect this will also contribute to a discussion at the General Affairs Council.  We will need time to study this document but I am sure it will provide an important input.<br\/><br\/>Let me briefly draw attention also to two particular national contributions Ireland is making to the humanitarian effort.  First, the Government has agreed this week to deploy an Irish naval vessel, the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>, to the Mediterranean to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations.  Secondly, we have pledged additional financial assistance of &euro;2 million to support those affected by the crisis in Syria, where a large percentage of refugees and migrants originate.  This brings the Government&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis to &euro;41 million over the past four years.<br\/><br\/>There is no easy solution to the hardship and human suffering we are witnessing on Europe&rsquo;s southern shores.  However, with the special meeting of the European Council in April and the issue scheduled for discussion by the European Council again in June, it is clear that migration is now at the top of the Union&rsquo;s political agenda.  I can assure members that Ireland will continue to play an active and determined role in the EU response.<br\/><br\/>The second issue to be considered by the General Affairs Council will be preparations for the June meeting of the European Council, with a focus on the draft agenda.  At first glance, the agenda of the June European Council might seem reasonably compact with just two items - security challenges and economic issues.  However, in reality, this disguises what is likely to be one of the fullest European Council agendas for some time.<br\/><br\/>I turn first to the security challenges.  A key priority for Heads of State and Government will be to review implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Previous orientations provided by the European Council in December 2013 addressed three key areas: increasing the effectiveness of CSDP; the development and provision of capabilities to support CSDP; and improving the ability of EU industry to provide those capabilities.<br\/><br\/>Next month&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council will review progress in implementing the December 2013 conclusions.  Good progress has been achieved on many fronts.  A maritime security strategy and action plan for its implementation was agreed in 2014, as was an EU cyber defence policy framework.  In the context of the European Defence Agency, a policy framework for long-term and systematic co-operation was approved by Ministers.  Since December 2013, four new CSDP operations have been launched: one in Ukraine, two in the Central African Republic and one in Mali.<br\/><br\/>The European Council is also expected to address areas where further progress is required, such as financing of EU missions and operations, development of military capabilities, and the further development of the EU&rsquo;s partnership policy with multilateral organisations, including the UN, NATO and OSCE.  It is also anticipated that High Representative<font color=\"#222222\">,<\/font>Federica Mogherini, will seek approval from Heads of State and Government to begin preparing a new European security strategy.  The new strategy will assess the impact of the changing nature of the global environment on the EU, as well as threats posed by international terrorism, serious and organised crime, human trafficking and cyber security.<br\/><br\/>The European Council will return to address the latest developments in Ukraine and, specifically, to consider whether to extend the timeframe for existing economic sanctions against Russia.  Some of these sanctions are due to expire in July.  At the March European Council, it was agreed that the duration of the current sanctions should be clearly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, which is foreseen by 31 December 2015.<br\/><br\/>Tragic events since the start of the year have also focused the attention of the European Council on threats within the European Union&rsquo;s own borders.  The European Council will review progress on implementation of the EU&rsquo;s counter-terrorism agenda.  This includes a number of different strands, such as tackling the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters, countering terrorist content on the Internet, improving international co-operation and information sharing, including through the operation of an EU passenger name record directive, and constructive engagement with third states, notably, Turkey, which is the main gateway for foreign fighters into Syria.  As previously referenced, migration will also feature prominently in European Council discussions, with Heads of State and Government reviewing progress and considering further steps.<br\/><br\/>The agenda item on economic issues provides an equal diversity of topics for the European Council to consider.  Very welcome from an Irish perspective will be a focus on the digital single market, with the European Council expected to outline next steps following presentation of the Commission&rsquo;s strategy on 6 May.  The strategy sets out 16 key actions to be delivered by the end of 2016 under three key pillars: simplifying access for consumers and business, creating the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish, and maximising the growth potential of the digital economy.  Ireland supports a high level of ambition for a fully functioning digital single market that is both open and competitive.  This would represent a win-win proposition for both consumers and SMEs, who will benefit more than multinationals in these circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The European Council will also be invited to endorse country-specific recommendations, CSRs,<b><\/b>published yesterday,<b><\/b>to guide member states in their structural reforms, employment policies and national budgets.  I will say a few words about Ireland&rsquo;s CSRs shortly.<br\/><br\/>The European Council will return to the question of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, and review progress since its most recent discussion in March.  The ninth round of negotiations took place in late April in New York with technical discussions on tariffs and procurement.  Discussions on other barriers to trade have been advancing and the basis architecture of the agreement is developing.  Both sides have affirmed their commitment to reaching an ambitious agreement as soon as possible, noting that TTIP will create jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic.<br\/><br\/>Also under economic issues, the European Council will consider the report to be presented by the four Presidents on better economic governance in the euro area.  Member state perspectives have been shared via official-level representatives of Heads of State and Government &ndash; the Sherpa network &ndash; and Ministers will take stock of developments at next week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council.  While a limited number of member states would prefer a more ambitious report, pointing, for example, towards common institutions, an EU fiscal capacity or binding reform contracts, Ireland and many other member states have underlined the importance of first fully implementing all existing EU instruments.  This includes the existing economic governance framework, including the macroeconomic imbalances procedure and banking union. <br\/><br\/>Finally on the June European Council, I would flag the possibility of Prime Minister Cameron setting out his thinking on aspects of the UK relationship with the EU, including where he will wish to target reforms.  His intentions in this regard may become clearer in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Overall, Ireland is pleased with the draft agenda for the European Council as currently presented.  It addresses many issues of strategic importance for Ireland and for the Union as a whole.  Ireland will, as always, contribute actively and constructively to the preparations for the European Council, and I look forward to my own role in this regard, both at next week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council and again at the June General Affairs Council.<\/p><p> The committee asked for a brief update following the publication yesterday of proposed country-specific recommendations.  The Commission is generally proposing fewer, more focused CSRs when compared to last year.  Ireland has been given four draft CSRs, covering the areas of public finances, health care reforms, work intensity of households, and sustainable mortgage and SME debt solutions.  The committee will note the continuity with issues highlighted by the Commission last year.  There were no surprises when the CSRs were published yesterday.  As I said, we were given four CSRs instead of seven.  Officials from relevant Departments are now giving careful consideration to the four draft CSRs and the underlying analysis with a view to providing a response to the Commission.  For the semester process to be effective, it is important that it be based on sound analysis and that there be a real partnership between the member states and the Commission.  The draft CSRs will be considered in the coming weeks by relevant Councils before endorsement at the June European Council.<\/p><p> I should add that Commissioner Moscovici will be in Dublin on 26 May and is due to meet the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, under the chairmanship of Deputy Liam Twomey, to discuss the European Semester issues.  Earlier that day, I will be joining the Commissioner at an Institute of International and European Affairs event focused on the Irish CSRs.  I am, of course, happy to hear any views the committee might have on the draft CSRs at any stage. <\/p><p> Before concluding, I would like to turn to the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  This issue was raised by the committee at our meeting before the March General Affairs Council, and I have since written to the Chairman on the subject.  I can confirm that the April General Affairs Council adopted conclusions expressing grave concern regarding the deteriorating situation in the country, particularly in the area of rule of law, fundamental rights and freedom of the media.  The Council also urged all sides to constructively engage to restart political dialogue and restore trust in the institutions.  I was deeply disturbed by developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia last weekend, which saw heavily armed militants clash with the police and army and, sadly, more than 22 people killed.  The events took place in Kumanovo, which is near the border with Kosovo and Serbia.  Commissioner Hahn made a statement in the immediate aftermath of the events, calling on &ldquo;the authorities and all political and community leaders to cooperate, to restore calm and fully investigate the events in an objective and transparent manner&rdquo;.  I fully support that call.  I can also assure the committee that the EU will continue to encourage all efforts to bring about stability in the region.<\/p><p> We have a busy few weeks ahead in the run-up to what is likely to be a pivotal meeting of the European Council in June.  I look forward to bringing the committee up to date on the preparations and on Irish Government perspectives when we meet again next month.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#B00400","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2534,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for a very comprehensive report.

I thought it was apt that the Minister of State welcomed the members of the diplomatic corps.<\/p><p>Initially, I wish to address the humanitarian issue, but I will then deal with economic matters that have implications not only for Ireland but also for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which I have the privilege of representing.  Migration is the major humanitarian crisis.  People who lost their homes have paid their life savings into the hands of people who, having no care for their welfare, have herded them onto ships and put them in real danger.  There has been significant loss of life.  It is good that the EU has worked on this and set out a programme to deal with the gangsters and police the area.  Obviously, it is policy to share the burden among European states.  It is a very complex and difficult matter.  I am happy that we are providing the naval vessel <i>LE Eithne<\/i>to help with policing as well as an additional &euro;2 million in funding.  We must play our part.  All EU countries will have to play their part, which will demand a high level of co-ordination.  Each country will be required by agreement to make an input in a structured way, instead of<i>ad hoc <\/i>charity, and to take a share of the migrants.  It cannot be left to Italy or Spain to deal with the problem.  Will the Minister of State inform the committee of how it is proposed to co-ordinate the efforts of individual countries so that each country will carry a burden proportionate to its size, population and resources?  No country has a greater sensitivity to this crisis than Ireland.  Any Irish person with a sense of history could only have a real empathy for these people. <\/p><p>I was happy to hear a reference to the forthcoming discussion on the digital economy.  This is an area of tremendous growth in Ireland both in terms of inward investment and domestic developments.  It offers great career potential and economic and social opportunities for our people.  The great weakness in our infrastructure is the lack of a universal high-speed broadband service.<\/p><p>There is patchiness and in areas with dispersed populations there are difficulties in this regard.  I am aware of the national broadband plan and its objectives are welcome because it is of critical importance that every home in every area of the country has high speed broadband.  It is the modern equivalent of rural electrification.  Is there anything further the Minister of State thinks can be done at European level to assist and even speed up our domestic efforts in this area as people are fed up with the delays?  How does he assess the opportunity to provide for further investment?  Large areas of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, especially the smaller villages and dispersed rural populations, do not have access to quality broadband and, in many cases, to any broadband service at all.  That needs correction as it is an injustice.  A divide is developing in the country and, while I know it is because of topography and the lack of commercial viability, intervention is needed.  I know that an intervention is planned, but this issue is very urgent.  It is a real issue in Cavan-Monaghan.<\/p><p> Another issue in our area is the weakness of the euro relative to sterling, which presents a tremendous opportunity to secure Internet sales and engage in marketing in the sterling area, including Northern Ireland.  There is a tremendous business opportunity in the Border region, specifically Cavan-Monaghan which I represent.  To take advantage of it, traders need to have confidence and an awareness of the potential, but they also need broadband to support it.  Will the Minister of State comment on this opportunity for people in my area and suggest what we can do to assist?<\/p><p> The next issue the Minister of State addressed, which is relevant to my constituency and the country, was the TTIP negotiations.  Will he look into his crystal ball and say how he sees it panning out in the coming weeks, months and years?  Will he publicly assure me and the people I represent that Ireland will bat for the domestic agriculture industry in the context of the TTIP?  Cavan-Monaghan is unique in having a huge dependence on primary production, with farmers, agribusiness and food processing.  Agrifood related jobs account for the vast bulk of all jobs in the area; therefore, anything that threatens agriculture will devastate the economy of the region.<\/p><p> The Chairman spoke about the possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  Personally I do not believe it will happen but that rationality will prevail and people's business and economic sense will tell them the importance of inward investment and the potential of the markets within the European Union.  The debate the United Kingdom will hold on the subject will change minds in favour of jobs and livelihoods and I believe sanity will prevail.  Nevertheless, we have to address the risks involved.  My concern is from a national perspective, but the implications of a British withdrawal would be aggravated in Cavan-Monaghan and right along the Border because of the prospect of customs control, the need for passports and the impact on businesses.  Will the Minister of State give us an assurance that Ireland will maintain a strong watching brief and that we will engage in bilateral initiatives with the Commission and the UK Government to protect Irish interests?  We need to try to prevent the breakaway, but in the event that we fail to do so, we need to have a contingency plan to protect Irish interests, which means the Irish economy and especially the economy of the Border region.  It would be remiss of a representative of a Border constituency to attend this meeting and not to emphasise the devastating impact if people such as the Minister of State did not make the necessary interventions to prevent the worst effects of a British withdrawal from the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#D00300","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2537,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials and wish him well in his deliberations in Brussels.  I also welcome members of the diplomatic corps and their representatives.  It is an opportunity for all of us, as members of the European Union, to exchange thoughts.  It is a pity that they cannot participate in the meeting, but we will meet at their various receptions and I appreciate their regular invitations to meet their ambassador and officials.<\/p><p>Deputy Joe O'Reilly is the leader of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe.  He does significant work and has been very involved in dealing with the tragedy of what is happening in the Middle East.  It was precipitated by the actions of the Bush-Blair amalgamation in Iraq and elsewhere, for which a price is now being paid.<\/p><p><i>RMS<\/i><i>Lusitania<\/i>went down 100 years ago with 1,190 people on board, while <i>Titanic<\/i>went down more than 100 years ago.  Both were human tragedies which it is right to remember, but some weeks ago 1,500 people went down off the coast of Italy and I do not read much about that tragedy in any newspaper now.  That shows the level of concern and the lack of acceptance of responsibility in the West, a point Mr. Peter Sutherland made very well when he spoke at a recent meeting of the joint committee.  No country suffered more than Ireland, with its 1 million emigrants, in the coffin ships which got into trouble off the coasts of Canada, America and Britain, all of whom helped us at the time.  It was right that Britain helped us because it had responsibility for the Irish Famine, but we will not go into that issue today as we have to try to forgive and forget.  We might forgive, but we will not forget.<\/p><p>On the negotiations with the United States of America, will the Minister of State outline the implications for the TTIP negotiations of the Senate voting against the trade Bill on Tuesday last?  I am not sure exactly how serious it is because the Bill has not been completed.  A deal with the United States of America should not be pursued at any cost and there should be no cost to the Irish economy, especially in the case of the agriculture sector.  We cannot allow hormone-fed beef into the Republic of Ireland at any cost to compete with our grass-fed, high-quality and often organic beef which we are exporting to the United States of America.  That has to be the bottom line for this country and we must veto any agreement which would affect our fundamental and basic industry.  During the difficulties faced by the building industry the economy was sustained by farming and agriculture.  That is a fact.<\/p><p>On the possible departure of Britain from the European Union, people should read Mr. Dan O'Brien's article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent.<\/i><\/p><p>He made interesting points in his article when he stated:<\/p><blockquote>The only upside to a British departure is that Ireland will become a relatively more attractive place for businesses seeking guarantees and unfettered access to the EU single market, still the biggest market in the world.  That is because there is a very considerable uncertainty over the kind of economic relationship Britain would have with the EU as a non-member.  Many members already ask why they should give one country all the benefits of membership (ie full access to the single market) without having the costs of playing by the rules.<\/blockquote><p>I agree with Deputy O'Reilly on the chances of Britain leaving the Union but in our negotiations as one of the 27 members it cannot be that Britain will not stay in the Union at any price.  If it is Britain's wish to leave the Union it must not be at any price to this country as far as the negotiations are concerned.  Members of this committee have been over to the UK.  With 56 Scottish MPs having been elected, if Britain decides to defect from the Union, Scotland will follow with independence.  As sure as night follows day, there is no doubt about that.  We may find the repercussions of what Britain does will result not long after that in the break-up of the United Kingdom for once and for all with perhaps our having a United Ireland because the Six Counties would be unviable in that situation.  All I know from my experience of working with those in Britain is that all we can do is congratulate the Prime Minister on his reappointment as Prime Minister.  Fair play to him.  It was a democratic election and he won fair and square.  UKIP is out of the picture.  He had to put certain ideas forward to win back votes and he was successful.  He will honour his commitment to have a referendum.  I think he will recommend that Britain stays in the Union.<br\/><br\/>While Britain has a friend in Ireland and we want it to stay in the Union, the Minister of State in his discussions and negotiations with the British Government must point out that it cannot be at any price or at a cost to the Republic of Ireland.  If Britain departs from the Union, we will have to play hardball with regard to the EU in terms of any repercussions that would have for this country.  We will be entering those negotiations not as a harmless or fearful player but as a determined one.  We will support and help Britain but, as a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I emphasise that we cannot do it at any cost to this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#E00200","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2539,"content":"<p>I have a few questions for the Minister of State.

I will start by responding to the measures taken to deal with the migration and the humanitarian crisis.  We would all acknowledge the loss of life in this crisis and Senator Leyden contrasted such loss to the centenary commemoration of the loss of life on the <i>Lusitania<\/i>in Cork last week, and we had the recent centenary commemorations of the loss of life on the <i>Titanic<\/i>.  A clear comparison can be made between those events.  Given the different circumstances of those two tragic events so long ago, the reality with respect to the events in the Mediterranean is that the European Union has a very important role to play to work towards reducing, to the absolute minimum, the number of people who will find themselves in circumstances where their lives are at great peril or ultimately lost.  Several factors feed into that.  At the most basic, there is a requirement to assist states that have arrived at a point, through conflict, bad governance or a broad range of issues, some economic and some religious, that have allowed people be of the view that while there is a risk to their lives in migrating, there is a greater risk to their lives in not migrating.  This involves not only the European Union but countries of the developed world and the developing world working together.  We have had meetings recently of the joint Council, involving justice and home affairs and foreign affairs Ministers, which was followed up by discussions at the General Affairs Council the following day, which I attended, and at the European Council meeting two days later.<\/p><p>This item is at the top of Europe's agenda.  Deputy O'Reilly requested that there would be a co-ordinated approach to dealing with this issue, and this is happening.  An Irish naval vessel will be deployed hopefully on Saturday.  We have contributed significant moneys and, as the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, said last evening, we will be taking in an additional 300 refugees.  There are different elements to and objectives within the proposal that has been made with respect to the next few months but members can be assured that Ireland, and the other member states, will continue to work to achieve some respite to the crisis.  As I said, a ten-point plan was agreed on 20 April and it will be discussed again in great detail next week.<\/p><p>I am taking the points raised in order and am moving from the serious humanitarian crisis just discussed to the question the Vice Chairman raised about the digital single market and the potential opportunities it will present for Ireland.  As he will be aware, significant moneys are being committed under the national broadband strategy.  The digital single market has three key areas.  To answer the Vice Chairman's question directly, the reason we can benefit from this single market is that we have 29 of the top 30 digital companies based in Ireland.  I wear another hat as the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection.  If one goes through a list of these companies, one will find they are nearly all large American companies.  That reminds us that in the broader digital economy, Europe has not managed to produce or to be significantly innovative.  The development of the digital single market along with the services single market presents an opportunity for Europe to regain the competitive advantage it has lost and continues to lose.  The digital single market strategy targets include simplifying access for consumers and businesses such as through harmonised consumer and contract rules, more efficient and affordable parcel delivery, tackling geo-blocking of digital services, further copyright modernisations and simplifying VAT rules.  Another target of the strategy is shaping the environment for digital networks and services to flourish such as reviewing telecoms and media rules to encourage investment in next generation infrastructure, management of the wireless spectrum and reviewing the role of online platforms such as illegal content and a review of e-privacy issues and, finally, maximising the growth of potential of the digital economy.<\/p><p>That includes having the right regulatory standards for big data and cloud computing and ensuring interoperability of e-services for the consumer, including through e-government and e-health services and also strengthening digital skills.  There is huge potential for every European country but Ireland perhaps is better placed than most in that regard.<\/p><p> I will briefly come to another area, namely, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  The vote on Tuesday night should send the positive result we in Ireland would like to see, and  I believe they will be voting again today.  President Obama has personally engaged with this issue.  When the Taoiseach visited Washington on St. Patrick's Day it was at the top of the agenda and they discussed the issue in great detail.  We are absolutely resolute with respect to the protection of our agricultural industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#F00300","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2542,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#G00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2543,"content":"<p>There will be significant benefits for the broader agricultural industry through TTIP.  We must all take every opportunity to point out when we talk about the dangers of lower standards being associated with TTIP that in no way is it going to be or allowed to be a vehicle for lower standards to be introduced in either direction.  In fact, TTIP gives the opportunity for the European Union and the United States of America, collectively, to set the bar and establish worldwide standards across food and other sectors.  This opportunity must be grasped.  In the beef sector we do have concerns and they are being addressed at the very highest level.  On the broader issue, TTIP is potentially of more benefit to Ireland than many other countries but all countries can benefit.  Given the GDP growth of somewhere between 1% and 2% for both jurisdictions, and given how hard we have struggled over the past five years plus to have any growth in GDP in the European Union, we should look very carefully at the potential of TTIP, in particular bearing in mind that the European Single Market itself was such a benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#G00300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2544,"content":"<p>I have a quick question in that regard.

We will wait and see what happens.<\/p> <p>  It is very important for Ireland that the Government continues to focus on this country and what we can achieve for ourselves within the European Union in terms of continuing to create jobs and employment.  To an extent, currently, this issue is a matter on which we are bystanders but at every opportunity I will make the point to my colleagues in the United Kingdom that countries in Europe, collectively, including the UK have done very well as members of the European Union.  We have had a very safe and secure Continent, when one considers what went on in previous generations.  There are many areas where we can champion what at times is an imperfect European Union but the benefits vastly outweigh the so-called disadvantages some may perceive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#G00900","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2550,"content":"<p>Could the Minister of State refer to the country-specific recommendations, CSRs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015051400002#G01000","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":2551,"content":"<p>In terms of the country-specific recommendations, we welcome the fact that there was a reduction in them.  We also welcome the fact that the Commission seems to have had a far more concise approach generally to the recommendations.  Your analysis, Vice Chairman, is accurate.  We did not foresee any surprises.  There are no surprises in our recommendations and they relate to the four areas of which we are already fully aware.  The fact sometimes gets lost in some of the narrative about the country-specific recommendations and their purpose, that they sometimes restate what a Government already knows.  It is not designed to be unhelpful, it is a simple statement of fact.  We have had a very difficult number of years economically and therefore in the area of health care, in particular in jobless households, we are aware that while we have reduced unemployment from 15.1% to below 10% currently, there are too many households where we need to assist people.  We must continue to foster an environment where jobs can be created.<\/p><p>The broad thrust of the CSRs, in Ireland's case, reflects the fact that this economy is being well run and is performing well.  It is certainly my intention, as a Minister of State, to ensure we continue to do that.

I am joined by Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary in my Department, Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general of the HSE, and members of his leadership team.  Members will recall that at the start of the year, the Minister of State and I set out our work programme for 2015.  It contained 25 actions under five major themes.  I will touch on each of them briefly and record some of the progress being made.<\/p> <p>  The first theme is Healthy Ireland.  We need to improve our health as individuals and as a nation.  This is the best way to ensure we live long and healthy lives and the most effective way to prevent illness and reduce health costs in the long term.<\/p><p>The legislation brought forward by the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, on plain packaging on tobacco was signed into law by the President on 10 March and my Department is currently drafting regulations on the prescribed aspects of the Act.  It is, as members know, subject to legal challenge.  <\/p><p> The general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on 10 February.  I intend to publish it before the summer recess.  As it has already been subject of a dedicated committee meeting, I will not say any more on it today.  Provisions under the Public Health (Sunbeds) Act 2014 requiring health information, warning signs, prohibitions on certain marketing practices, health claims, notification requirements, fee and fixed penalty notices were commenced in February and March.  This will discourage younger people in particular from using sunbeds, while imposing stricter regulation on providers.  It will reduce skin cancer prevalence and save lives.<\/p><p> Recent statistics reveal that 61% of Irish adults and one in four primary school children are now overweight or obese.  My Department held a major stakeholder consultation at the end of April on what we need to do collectively to address the challenge of overweight and obesity.  The consultation brought together key stakeholders to prioritise the actions which Government and other sectors need to take over the next ten years to tackle overweight and obesity.  A new obesity policy and action plan will be finalised this year and brought to Government for approval.  While some comments and reports on the matter in recent weeks were sensationalised and not evidence-based, which serves no good, it is a real personal and public health issue and needs to be taken as seriously in the future as tobacco in the recent past and alcohol now.  <\/p><p> The second theme is patient outcomes and patient safety.  As members know, I have taken a personal interest in emergency department overcrowding.  Overcrowding in our hospitals has eased since January and is trending downwards.  Progress is being made but it still remains higher than at this point last year.  Similarly, the number of delayed discharges has fallen from a peak of 850, but remains at about 680.  At the beginning of April the Government approved additional funds of &euro;74 million to reduce delayed discharges by providing &euro;44 million to the fair deal scheme resulting in an additional 1,600 places, and &euro;30 million to provide an extra 250 convalescent and rehabilitation beds in community and district hospitals.  The implementation of these measures has now begun but will take about eight weeks to fully implement.<\/p><p> As of 30 April there were 575 people on the fair deal waiting list with an average wait time of four weeks from the date of approval, down from 11 weeks at the start of the year.  More than half of the additional community and district hospital beds are now open.  The emergency department task force report needs to be fully implemented and I will personally drive this.  There will always be surges in demand, and all health services have patients on trolleys from time to time, but trolley waits of nine, 12 and 24 hours represent a real patient safety risk and need to be reduced considerably.  I have mandated the HSE to ensure than nobody is waiting more than 18 months for a surgical procedure or outpatient appointment by July, and no more than 15 months by the end of the year.  I know that may not seem very ambitious, and it is not, but within current resources it is realistic and achievable in all but a small number of sub-specialties.  While the numbers on waiting lists are likely to continue to rise as demand rises, I want to make sure that those who are waiting are not waiting as long.  <\/p><p> On patient safety, we are continuing to develop and monitor the implementation of the national clinical effectiveness guidelines, of which there are six to date with a further two currently in development, namely, the national paediatric early warning system and the clinical handover for acute services, and we are continuing to develop better implementation of HIQA recommendations.  The HSE's joint open disclosure policy with the State Claims Agency is now being used in 47 acute hospitals and five PCCC areas, up from 15 hospitals and one PCCC area in 2013.<\/p><p> The third theme is universal health.  Agreement was reached with the IMO in April on GP care without fees for the under-sixes and over-70s and on the introduction of an asthma cycle of care for children and a diabetes cycle of care for medical card or GP visit card holders who have type 2 diabetes.  This represents the first step in the phased introduction of a universal GP service and will benefit over 300,000 senior citizens and children this summer.  On universal health insurance, I firmly believe that we need to make health insurance more affordable before we can make it universal.  At the end of 2014 I announced a number of actions to achieve this.  These include a reduction in risk equalisation stamp duty, a reduction in the HIA levy, no further diminution of tax relief, discounts for young adults and, last month, the introduction of lifetime community rating.  As a result some premiums have been reduced, others frozen and new affordable products are on offer.  The number of people with health insurance is rising again and initial indications suggest that a very large number of people signed up in the past few weeks to beat the LCR deadline.  I have learned this morning, in fact, that 74,000 additional people signed up in the past few weeks and the figure for the year so far is 80,000.<\/p><p> The fourth theme is reform, including greater investment in IT, which saw a 30% increase in budget this year to &euro;55 million in capital.  Key IT projects include e-referral, so that GPs can make referrals to hospitals online; electronic patient records, a move from paper to electronic records which we hope will be fully in place by the end of the decade, so that the moment a person gets into the back of an ambulance a paramedic can access their medical records on an i-Pad; and the issuing of the first individual health identifiers later this year - a sort of PPS number for health.  I would encourage the committee to invite Mr. Richard Corbridge, chief information officer for the HSE, to come in to brief you on these very exciting plans.<\/p><p> The fifth theme is investment in modern infrastructure and facilities.  The most important of these is the new children's hospital, the biggest single health infrastructure project ever in the history of the State.  The planning application for the hospital will be lodged this summer and, subject to An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision, we could have planning permission by Christmas or early in the new year with construction commencing soon after.  I visited Great Ormond Street Hospital in London this week and I can assure the committee that the new children's hospital we have planned will be more modern and have more beds and operating theatres than any children's hospital in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> On the overall financial position of the health service, the latest figures from the HSE demonstrate the significant challenge facing us as a result of the changing demographics in Ireland.  Over the next few years, the population aged 65 and over will increase by approximately 20,000 per year, placing increased pressure on our acute hospital, community, and social care sectors.  We will continue to work to develop safe quality services for patients, while at the same time looking for ways to reduce costs.  While it is difficult at this stage to draw conclusions as to the year-end position based on data from January and February, due to a number of factors including the exceptionally high level of delayed discharges during these two months, the new measures recommended by the ED task force and agreed by Government, along with the ongoing reform of practices and processes in hospitals, are beginning to show results.  Current expenditure projections are preliminary in nature, and my Department and the HSE are working together to understand the deficit to date and the likely full year impact of this variance and emerging and known funding pressures.  The HSE is moving to reduce overspending and is working closely with the Department to mitigate the projected deficit to the greatest degree possible.  Mr. Tony O'Brien will speak on this further if members wish.<\/p><p> I want to turn now to maternity services and, in particular, to the recently published HIQA report on Portlaoise hospital.  Many aspects of the HIQA report disturb me, as I am sure they do committee members.  I am ashamed at the manner in which patients were treated without respect, care and compassion when they most needed it by members of my own profession and other professions.  Many did not receive the quality of care we should expect from a modern health service in the developed world.  Patients and their families were treated dreadfully and at times inhumanely.  As I have said previously, it is not all about resources and we should challenge those who seek to make resources the excuse for all failings.  If we allow it to be an excuse it will always be the default excuse.  That in itself is a threat to patient safety.  It costs nothing to care.  Honesty costs nothing - and in fact it probably saves money - and neither does compassion.  Adherence to professional standards and being properly trained and accredited to do one's job should be a given.  Too often, it is not.<\/p><p> The report highlights the urgent need to embed a patient safety culture right throughout the health service.  I intend that this should not just be another report.  It should be a watershed report.  Patient safety, outcomes and quality must never come second to institutional, corporate, staff or local political interests.  Decisions made on resource allocation and service location must be made on the basis of what is best for patients in terms of safety or outcomes, not financial savings or votes.  Having met some former patients and there families last night, I am more convinced than ever that a patient advocacy service should be established and it will be fully independent of the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p> All mistakes are not medical negligence and mistakes and misjudgments will always happen - that is the nature of medicine.  All complaints will not be valid or upheld.  But we need to move to a new culture when complaints are welcomed and seen as a tool to guide us in improving services and patient satisfaction.  Too often and for too long the health service has been defensive in dealing with complaints and fails to deal with them in a timely manner and therefore adds insult to injury and hurt on hurt.  An independent patient advocacy service will be crucial in supporting patients and changing that culture.  I accept the HIQA report in full and thank the investigation team for its work.  The four recommendations made to my Department will be implemented.  The HSE has confirmed that it too will implement the four recommendations made to it.  I expect the HSE to implement an action plan to address the findings of the report without delay, and certainly by the end of the year.  <\/p><p> Improvements have been, and will continue to be made at Portlaoise hospital, which I had the opportunity to visit yesterday.  New management and governance structures, both clinical and operational, are in place, including a new hospital manager and a director of midwifery for the first time, as well as an on-site risk manager.<\/p><p>Appointments have been made to key posts of concern in both the maternity and general services.  This includes additional consultants in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics and obstetrics.  Sixteen additional midwives have been appointed and approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders and posts in diabetics and ultra-sonography.  An ambulance by-pass protocol is in place for serious paediatric and trauma cases.  For the record, it is important to point out that since the Government came to office the number of midwives employed in the public health service has increased from 1,100 to 1,400 and the number of consultant obstetricians is at an all-time high.  It is certainly nowhere near where it needs to be and it is not up to international standards but it does show that during a period of cutbacks the Government did prioritise front-line services in particular in this area.<\/p><p> Structural change has begun, with Portlaoise hospital now forming part of the Dublin-Midlands hospital group.  Governance of the maternity service will transfer to the Coombe in line with a memorandum of understanding agreed already.  At the end of April, I appointed a steering group chaired by Ms Sylda Langford, former director general of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to prepare a new maternity strategy for Ireland.  In doing so, I am implementing one of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the care of Ms Savita Halappanavar.<\/p><p> The new maternity strategy will put the needs of mothers, babies and their families at its centre.  The focus will be on maximising patient safety, quality of care, and clinical outcomes as well as the desirability of greater patient choice, the move towards more services in the community, and a renewed focus on prevention and well-being.  I have asked the group to report to me by the end of the year.  As committee members are aware, ten years ago cancer care in Ireland was below standard and fragmented, and we did not collect data properly.  Today, it is well organised and survival rates are improving all the time.  I want to adopt the same programmatic approach that was adopted to cancer to women's and infant health in the next decade.<\/p><p> There are a number of other initiatives and developments on which I would be happy to update the committee but I know my time is limited and committee members will also want to hear from the director general and to ask questions, so I will conclude at this point.  I will be happy to respond to queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#B00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2563,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and call Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431592200,"counter":2564,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I am joined by a number of my colleagues: Ms Laverne McGuinness, deputy director general, Mr. Liam Woods, national director of the acute hospital division, Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, national director of clinical strategy and programmes, Mr. Pat Healy, national director of the social care division, and Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, national director of the mental health division.<\/p> <p>  The committee requested information and replies on a number of specific issues prior to this meeting and members will have received a written response to each of them.  In my opening remarks I would like to update the committee on a number of issues.  The first relates to the HIQA report concerning the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, MRHP.<\/p> <p>  The HSE on Friday last received the final report of the investigation into the quality, safety and standards of services provided by the HSE to patients at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The HSE welcomes the conclusion of the HIQA investigation, accepts all of the recommendations of this report and acknowledges that their implementation will contribute to improving the quality and standard of services delivered in Portlaoise hospital and similar hospitals.  The HSE has already taken objective steps to improve the quality and safety of services in Portlaoise over the past two years.  These important steps are included within many of the HIQA recommendations.  As a consequence of the measures taken, the HSE is confident that MRHP provides a safe level of service to its patients in the midlands today, although there are undoubtedly questions of sustainability to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The HSE has already acknowledged that there have been failings at Portlaoise over the years.  The HSE has in the past apologised for these failures and the suffering and distress that they caused to the families concerned, and I reiterate that apology once again today.  Last year in the context of some of the very distressing reports, I wrote to every health service staff member about this and that letter is appended to the printed version of my statement.<\/p> <p>  The hospital in Portlaoise provides extremely important services to the midland counties and is a very busy hospital today.  For example, it is expected that there will be approximately 1,900 births in its maternity unit this year.  I am also very conscious of the potential of negative publicity surrounding this report to undermine the confidence of some of the patients who use the hospital's services.  Any negative publicity is also likely to impact on the hard working and dedicated staff who have been putting their hearts and souls into their work in the hospital in very trying circumstances, where demand for services is increasing and resources continue to remain limited.  I wish to emphasise that any failings relating to the past either have now been or are being rectified and that Portlaoise hospital is now on a path to being an excellent hospital as part of a wider group.  Significant improvements have been, and continue to be, implemented in both maternity and general services at the hospital, which is overseen by a joint steering group comprised of representatives from Portlaoise and other hospitals in the Dublin-Midlands hospital group, including the recently appointed chief executive officer of the group, Dr. Susan O'Reilly.<\/p> <p>  An important improvement is the introduction of an expanded and new management and governance structure, both clinical and operational, for the maternity unit and the general hospital.  This new structure allows for strengthened management at local level and clearer reporting relationships within the Dublin-Midlands hospital group.  Central to these new arrangements is the formalisation of existing pathways between the maternity unit and the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  In this regard a clinical director for integration has been appointed.  Furthermore, existing relationships between Portlaoise and Tullamore, Tallaght, Naas and St. James's hospitals are being further developed and strengthened particularly in the areas of emergency medicine, ICU, surgery and bed capacity.<\/p> <p>  An area of concern, raised in a number of reports over the recent past, has been in relation to staffing levels.  The staffing moratorium across the public service over the past five years has impeded a full resolution of this situation up to recent times, as a consequence of a much reduced health budget arising from the financial emergency.  A considerable number of staff have been, and continue to be, appointed to key posts of concern in both the maternity and general services.  This includes a number of additional consultant posts in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics, and physician posts.  In relation to midwifery posts, 16 additional midwives have been appointed and are in place.  Approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders in delivery, and posts in diabetics and ultra-sonography.  Additional general nursing posts are also in progress.  A full review has been conducted of the structures and processes of quality, safety and risk in both the maternity unit and the general hospital.  Following this review a significant number of improvements have taken place.<\/p> <p>  The appointment of quality and patient safety, QPS, managers for both the maternity unit and the general hospital will considerably strengthen the QPS function.  The management of complaints has also been examined and improved.  Following the national patient safety culture survey, conducted by the quality improvement division of the HSE in 2013 and 2014, a report of the results from the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise has been produced and disseminated to all relevant parties.  Among the many other improvements in Portlaoise hospital, patients, following triage in the emergency department, are now under the care and accountability of a named consultant at all times.  Portlaoise hospital has also fully implemented the national open disclosure policy, the national consent policy and national bereavement care guidelines.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, the maternity unit has implemented the national early warning score, NEWS, and the Irish maternity early warning score, IMEWS.  Furthermore, all midwifery staff in the maternity unit have received training in cardiotocograph, CTG, and additional online training facilities have been introduced.  In light of this report I have taken the decision to bring in an external investigator in accordance with our disciplinary procedure to look at issues of concern.  Many issues were escalated but they did not always find their way to the right decision making levels and that must be investigated in accordance with fair procedures  Many of the issues which arise in Portlaoise hospital are not just about resources or the quality of clinical care but about the human and compassionate care that was or was not provided.  Accordingly, a separate examination will examine this matter.  The names of the investigators and terms of reference will be published shortly.<\/p> <p>  It is important, starting in the maternity unit in Portlaoise hospital and the wider hospital and other maternity hospitals, that we have a thorough programme of empowering nursing and midwifery leadership and interdisciplinary leaders to drive compassion in care.  Following the lead of the NHS in England and Scotland, respectively, we intend to implement the Florence Nightingale Foundation&rsquo;s leading for compassion programme and the caring behaviours assurance system, CBAS, programme throughout the health service.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the national service plan, members are aware that each month performance against our national service plan targets and deliverables is monitored and measured.  The latest published performance report shows that in February 2015 there were 185,688 emergency attendances for the first two months of the year.  While the average daily attendance is up 5%, or 177 per day on January, the overall attendances are 2.1% less than the same period for 2014.  The number of delayed discharges has fallen from a peak of 850 on 4 January to 705 at the end of February.  Additional funding of &euro;74 million, provided by the Government, has assisted in alleviating pressures in acute hospitals by providing additional nursing home placements.<\/p><p>The two most recent delayed discharge reports of 28 April and 5 May 2015 recorded fewer than 700 delayed discharges for the first time since September 2014 and the trajectory is now downwards.<\/p><p> The national plan prioritises a reduction in waiting times for hospital care with a focus on those waiting the longest so that nobody will wait longer than 18 months at the end of June or 15 months by year end.  In February, 98% of adults were seen within this timeframe for an inpatient or day case procedure and 82% of patient were waiting less than 52 weeks for an outpatient appointment.  Plans are being finalised to ensure the June target of no patient waiting longer than 18 months is achieved.<\/p><p> With regard to emergency ambulances, the percentage calls responded to within eight minutes and 59 seconds by ECHO reached 78% and by DELTA reached 65% during the month.  A total of 82% of referrals accepted by child and adolescent mental health teams were offered a first appointment within 12 weeks against a target of 78%.  A total of 13,407 people were in receipt of a home care package during February, which is 10.5% more than the same time last year.  In mental health services, difficulty in filling staff vacancies remains a significant challenge to providing timely and appropriate care.  A number of recruitment campaigns are under way to address this.<\/p><p> In primary care, work is progressing on improving access to primary services through the extension of GP care free at the point of delivery to all children under six and all adults over 70.  Contracts have now been issued to GPs for signing following agreement with the IMO on the details, and public registrations are due to commence from June 2015.  This service enhancement due to commence from July will provide GP access, wellness health checks and asthma care for children, and care for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care in accordance with the models of best practice for the management of chronic medical conditions.<\/p><p> The investigation into &Aacute;ras Attracta and the disciplinary procedure is progressing on schedule, having received clearance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to recommence its work.  The aim is to have the investigation work completed by the end of May or early June, with findings and a final report completed by the end of July.  Dr. Kevin McCoy's assurance review is progressing well, having met residents, family members, staff and management.  In addition to recommending specific plans for each centre in &Aacute;ras Attracta, the output from the review team will help to inform our system-wide programme of improvement.  A new governance structure is being implemented, with a new director of service post advertised.  Under the leadership of the new director, three discrete centres will operate in the campus, each centre specialising on the particular needs of service users.  A residents' council is being established as part of the national volunteer advocacy programme.<\/p><p> The new policy &ldquo;Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse&rdquo; is being fully implemented with nine safeguarding and protection teams being established, one per community health care organisation.  The recruitment of 20 additional social work posts has commenced.  The quality improvement enablement teams are in place and are focused on supporting our centres, in transferring HIQA standards into good practice in front-line services.  The initial phase has prioritised HSE residential centres, with the team visiting more than 50 centres delivering services to 448 people, representing almost 25% of HSE residential services.  In addition, a confidential recipient, Leigh Gath, has been appointed, who is independent in her functions with the authority to examine concerns and to hear of issues and complaints in a totally confidential manner.<\/p><p> There have been recent media reports on the accessibility of mental health services for children and adolescents.  The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion regardless of where in the country the service is accessed .  A number of measures have been put in place to improve access to and quality of these specialist services.  These include a CAMHS service improvement project established to review and improve, where necessary, performance relating to both inpatient and community CAMHS.<\/p><p> I am also pleased to advise the committee that seven new suicide prevention officers have been recruited and they will take up duty shortly.  It is also anticipated that additional suicide prevention resource officers will be recruited later this year through the 2015 mental health development funding.<\/p><p> Despite the progress being made in our mental health services I am particularly concerned at the significant challenges posed by the recruitment of nursing and medical grades, which are now impacting on service delivery.  The mental health division is working closely with HR and the national recruitment service to progress overseas recruitment initiatives to address this issue.<\/p><p> Primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, commonly known as coronary angioplasty or simply angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure used to treat the stenotic, or narrowed, coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease.  In November, the acute hospitals division of the HSE requested the national clinical programme for acute coronary syndrome, ACS, programme to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The model of care produced by the ACS programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  The programme was also informed by models of care from the United States and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24-7 requirements of this service.<\/p><p> Based on this comprehensive review, the HSE took the decision to consolidate the service in Dublin into two centres, which reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on a smaller number of sites to allow for the concentration of volume and expertise.  Since 17 April there are two 24-7 PPCI centres for Dublin, located in the Mater hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  These centres now accept all ambulance transfers of Dublin patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI.<\/p><p> In the wider context of percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI services, a review of these services is under way and will be completed shortly.  Once complete, PCI capacity nationally, including Waterford, will be examined.  This review will look at the further provision of PCI services nationally in the best interest of patients and on evidence on the volume of clinical need, the quality and safety of the service that can be provided, the ability to staff it safely and the resources available.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2566,"content":"<p>I remind members that on Tuesday we will have a specific stand-alone meeting with the HSE on the HIQA report into the hospital in Portlaoise and I ask them to be conscious of this in their responses to Mr. O'Brien and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2567,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State, the director general of the HSE and others.  We accept we will have a meeting next week with the HSE to discuss the findings of the Portlaoise report, but it is important while the Minister and the director general of the HSE are before us to raise some points which are of huge concern about the report and any interpretation to be put on it.<\/p> <p>  Why we have the report in the first place makes for very sad and debilitating reading.  When we see the testimony and listen to the families involved, the huge resistance put up by the HSE to engaging with them even on finding out basic and general information and trying to elicit the truth seems to be the culture and normal practice.  To speak about freedom of information in general, this is extending throughout many Departments.  I will make the political point that it is getting more and more difficult for citizens, be they Members of the Opposition or anybody else, to get information from the State.  We must be very honest.  We speak about open disclosure in the context of medicine and clinical decisions, but there must be open disclosure across the full remit of the State.  In this context the HSE has much to do.<\/p> <p>  The service priorities for the 2015 service plan include improved quality and patient safety, with a focus on service user experience, the development of a culture of learning and improvement, patient, service users and staff engagement, medication management, health care associated infections, serious incidents and reportable offence, complaints and compliments, implementing quality patient safety and an enablement programme.  We can only hope that on foot of the report into Portlaoise and its recommendations that we will act upon the opening statement of the HSE's service plan.<\/p> <p>  I read the letter Mr. O'Brien sent to all members of staff of the HSE after the \"Prime Time\" report.  It calls for people to engage with patients, more openness and asking the staff in general to make the best efforts possible.  It mentions an apparently unfeeling bureaucracy and excessive defensiveness in a way which appears only to serve self-interest.  Much of this is explained.  It was important to send the letter to the staff after the \"Prime Time\" report.<\/p><p>However, when I read the report it appears that even the person signed the letter on behalf of the HSE, Mr. O'Brien, did not even act on the recommendations of the CMO.<br\/><br\/>The HIQA report stated:<\/p><blockquote>In his report, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer said two previous HSE reviews published in 2008 into breast cancer misdiagnosis cases at Portlaoise Hospital should have provided a very strong case for &lsquo;external oversight and support to Portlaoise Hospital as it dealt with the legacy of those issues&rsquo;...<br \/><br \/>Six previous investigations into hospital care in Ireland have been carried out by the Authority [that is HIQA] between 2007 and 2013.  These have made a number of important findings and recommendations which were intended to be used by all healthcare services to inform and improve practice.  Had the relevance of these investigation findings been reviewed in the context of Portlaoise Hospital and the aligned recommendations been subsequently implemented, the Authority is of the opinion this could have vastly reduced the identified risks in the services being provided to patients.<\/blockquote><p>We have had the Tania McCabe tragedy in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, we have had the Savita Halappanavar case, and we have had the investigations into Mallow and Ennis hospitals.  There seems to be no ability for the organisation to take the best practice from within the system.  More important, when recommendations are made, there seems to be a complete inability to follow through on those.<br\/><br\/>This is an issue for the Minister as well.  Representatives of HIQA appeared before the committee yesterday.  They made the point that the regulator should not be the body overseeing the implementation of the recommendations.  Equally the organisation that is requested to implement the recommendations should not also be overseeing it.<br\/><br\/>Without being overly hostile to the HSE, any reading of this Portlaoise report would seem to indicate that almost nothing has been learned from the previous seven reports and, if it has, it has not been implemented.  In the context of a patient safety advocacy group, we should consider establishing some form of commission to oversee the implementation of recommendations of a regulator.<br\/><br\/>The report also states: &quot;At the time of reporting in May 2015 &ndash; some 13 months after the publication of this recommendation by the Chief Medical Officer &ndash; these arrangements were still not in place.&quot;  Those arrangements were that in the interim Portlaoise hospital would continue:<\/p><blockquote>to operate in the absence of formal systems enabling clinical cooperation and communication between it and some of the larger training hospitals that are to be involved in the group.  The Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s report made a specific recommendation about ensuring the networking of senior clinical leadership between the larger Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital in Dublin and the maternity unit within the smaller Portlaoise Hospital.<\/blockquote><p>I find it extraordinary that that had not been fully implemented in the context of the Chief Medical Officer's report that was published 13 months ago.<br\/><br\/>We can go into further detail on this in Tuesday, but I really need an explanation of this one.  Page 12 of the report states:<\/p><blockquote>The pivotal appointment of a director of midwifery to a maternity department located within a general hospital is unique to Portlaoise Hospital.  This role has had a very positive influence in terms of assessing and improving the standard of midwifery care, enhancing multidisciplinary working relationships, improving staff morale and re-energising a patient-centred approach to care.<\/blockquote><p>As with much of this report the next word is &quot;however&quot;:<\/p><blockquote>However, at the time of writing, a senior obstetric lead had not been appointed to the Maternity Department to provide independent senior experienced obstetric clinical leadership.  This is despite a direct request by the Authority [that is, HIQA, again] to the Director General [that is, Mr. O'Brien] of the HSE in September 2014 to do so because of the investigation team&rsquo;s concerns about the absence of adequate clinical leadership within the maternity unit and the failure to progress the development of a clinical network with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.<\/blockquote><p>I know that a memorandum of understanding has since been signed with the Coombe hospital.  However, I find it extraordinary that more effort was not made.<br\/><br\/>The Minister's contribution did not really refer to the major crisis that is facing us with outpatient waiting lists.  Some 412,000 people are waiting for an outpatient appointment and it is getting worse.  At some stage the Minister will have to accept they cannot do it themselves.  It will be necessary to re-engage the National Treatment Purchase Fund and admit that the system is not working.  We need to engage with the private sector at least to allow patients a chance of being seen and getting treatment in a reasonable time.<br\/><br\/>May I come back again later?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#E00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2569,"content":"<p>The Deputy can indeed.

Last week the Minister announced the appointment of a steering group to help prepare a national maternity strategy.  Yesterday, speaking to the media in Portlaoise, he speculated on the closure of a number of smaller so-called maternity units.  It is very premature to talk in those terms when any number of measures that would warrant consideration should be examined before such a serious step would even be contemplated.  I would have liked to have heard him acknowledge the inadequate staffing provision leading to an impossible situation for many who provide excellent maternity services across our 19 maternity units.  We need to recognise that there were 33 unfilled vacancies at Portlaoise hospital.  The recruitment to fill these positions is only now being seriously addressed.  It is very premature and I am very concerned because it only fuels the upset and confusion.  The director general spoke about negative publicity.  Again, suggesting more closures is a negative step.  It is not dealing with the problem at all.  Women do not want to be displaced and herded into factory production in over-centralised settings which clearly lack the compassion, care, time and attention they deserve in these situations.  The overwhelming number of them are not sick; they are having a child.<\/p> <p>  The director general said that the HSE received the final report of the investigation into Portlaoise hospital on Friday.  What differences were there between the final report and the report that gave rise to his very strong intervention that went so far as to threaten legal action to injunct the publication of that draft report?  What was the difference between the draft report and the final one, when apparently, from what the director general has said and the Minister has indicated, the HSE is accepting all the recommendations that directly impact on the HSE?  What was the difference?  What gave rise to his first reaction and his more accepting stance to the report in its final presentation?<\/p> <p>  I will not continue to address the Portlaoise report at this point, knowing that we have the debate on Tuesday.  I do not want the issues I had highlighted for quarterly address to be completely lost.<\/p><p>They merited it and I would like to refer to it.  The first concerned question No. 9, in which I raised the issue of vulnerable adults and their safe care in a variety of settings.  We are talking about aged and vulnerable adults who are unable to articulate and represent themselves.  &Aacute;ras Attracta might be a backdrop to the question, although I am not specifically or solely addressing that setting.  The Minister's reply states that under the policy, that is, the safeguarding of vulnerable persons at risk of abuse national policy procedures, all service providers are required to have a publicly stated no-tolerance approach to abuse.  What does \"no tolerance\" mean?  Could the Minister translate that for me?  Despite all the public attention and the expos&eacute; on national television, I am not convinced that this issue has been satisfactorily addressed.  The fears and concerns still remain.<\/p><p> I note that at the end of the subsequent paragraph the Minister states that in cases of suspected sexual abuse, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would always be notified.  Why would the Garda not always be notified in cases of physical abuse and assault?  Why does the answer refer specifically only to cases of suspected sexual abuse?  Would cases of suspected or actual physical abuse and assault not always be notified to the Garda?  If this has not been the case, will the Minister give us an assurance that it is now and always will be in the future?  Abuse of an elderly person or a vulnerable adult should always carry both criminal and civil penalties and strong legislation is required in this area.  Elderly persons and dependent adults are a disadvantaged section of society.  I have such adults in my immediate family and I am sure many others in this room can identify and empathise with this critically important situation.  I want to see the very best guarantees enshrined in legislation.  I do not ever again want to wake up to new revelations of elder abuse or the abuse of dependent adults.<\/p><p> My question No. 10 concerns the vaccine for meningitis B.  We have seen examples of the impact of meningitis, and meningitis B accounts for the majority of cases in Ireland.  We have the highest incidence of meningococcal disease in Europe and there was a significant increase of up to 25% in cases in 2013.  Children under five are the highest risk age group.  I am very concerned about the response to my question, which states that the introduction of any new vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation schedule will be considered in the context of recommendations from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, the outcome of cost-effectiveness analysis, the conclusions of the review of the HSE vaccination services currently being carried out, and resource availability.  This is not an answer.  The issue is not being actively and seriously considered.  I am anxious to know if it will be revisited.  Is it the case that only parents who can afford to buy the vaccine will be able to protect their children from meningococcal disease?<\/p><p> My question No. 11 raises access to emergency dental general anaesthetic services in Dublin city.  Those services were withdrawn last year, yet the Minister's answer states that a protocol is now in place requiring this service remain under regular review.  Heaven protect us all.  What is being done to ensure a public service of a high standard is in place which children who are dependent on the public service and require an anaesthetic for extractions will be able to access?  The service was in place in St. James's Hospital until it ceased last year.  The consequences are very serious for the families who are directly impacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#F00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2572,"content":"<p>In the absence of Deputy Healy I call Senator van Turnhout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2573,"content":"<p>I concur with my colleagues, Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, on the Midland Regional Hospital report.  As we will have dedicated time for this as a committee, I would now like to focus on some of the questions I raised, which are of critical importance.<\/p> <p>  My question No. 14 concerns the children and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  I raised this because of a report produced in March 2015 by Dr. Helen Buckley, chair of the national review panel on children who died in the care of the State.  The report was about 26 vulnerable children and stated that three out of four teenage girls who died by suicide were known to our child protection services and, for lengthy periods before their deaths, were on waiting lists for psychological services.  According to the individual reports on the circumstances surrounding 12 of the deaths, at one point before taking her life, one of the girls, called Jennifer in the report, had been on a waiting list for psychological services for two years.  Her mother had tried to access mental health services the week before she died.  This happened last year.  It is not something historical.  Another case concerns a teenage girl, named Zoe in the report, who had been in and out of State care in childhood.  Her case with the social work department had been closed months before she died by suicide.<\/p> <p>  I am hearing more and more that there is an urgency to close cases rather than being absolutely assured that the child is getting the services she or he needs.  Dr. Helen Buckley states that mental health difficulty is very prevalent among people and their parents.  Referring to waiting lists, she states that two years is the treatment time she is seeing in the cases she is looking at.  She further states that young people in critical conditions are often receiving very limited treatment.  This is echoed by the child care law reporting project led by Dr. Carol Coulter and her team, which gives us an insight into child care proceedings in the courts.  This project reports on very recent cases and the characteristics and demographics mirror all those interplaying factors identified by Dr. Buckley.<\/p> <p>  I am frustrated by the lack of urgency within our mental health services.  We know from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland that by age 13, one in three young people is likely to have experienced some type of mental disorder.  By the age of 24 that has increased to one in two.  How we deal with it at that age frames how we deal with it for life.  Getting it right at that age is critical for our lives.  When I talk to community-based organisations on the ground, they say the pathways for getting to the services are extremely difficult.  For example, I was talking to a person in Tallaght who told me that although Jigsaw and Headstrong employ a consultant psychiatrist, they cannot refer directly to CAMHS but have to refer the young person to a GP who can then refer them on.  It does not make sense when they have a consultant psychiatrist who specialises in the field.  They say to me they do not have a waiting list because they do not tolerate a policy of any waiting list.  For someone who is experiencing severe mental health issues, even 12 weeks seems a long time in that critical phase.<\/p> <p>  I could make the same speech on this issue as I made four years ago.  From talking to the organisations on the ground, I do not know where it is going, particularly in respect of services outside the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. period.  What are youth workers to do and how can they get help for a young person?  The issue needs more attention.<\/p> <p>  On question No. 12 regarding the hospice friendly hospitals programme, I am surprised there is no mention of the HSE palliative care co-ordinators.  This was in the joint committee's report on end-of-life care.  We had a really good engagement with the HSE on that report and I am surprised it has not been mentioned.  Perhaps we could have more detail on that.<\/p><p> I was very disappointed by the answer to question No. 13 and I believe a more detailed answer will come.  It gives the impression that things are happening but, sadly, they are not.  We only have seven months left in four-year policy programme to get to our implementation plan.  The programme has been there for four years and we have seven months left but we still do not have the implementation plan.  This is about stroke survivors and rehabilitation care.  It is totally unacceptable that we do not have that yet.  I agree that health service funding can be part of the problem but much of what is required could be delivered through reorganisation.  We must do much more about this, as we have seen a deterioration in service in the lifetime of this Government rather than an improvement.  This area needs extra focus but I will await a further answer.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister about the children's hospital.  I welcome his statement and his visit to Great Ormond Street Hospital.  In the media there is a very strong focus on the geographical location but this committee's understanding, having visited the site, is there is an idea of satellites, consistency of services and outreach.  It has not really been conveyed to the public.  Has there been a decision on the maternity hospital, as it is important to consider the site and the services in play?  I repeat my welcome for free GP care for those under six; it is a prevention and early intervention step, and it is a very positive move to a rights-based approach to health care.  I want to see all children getting the health care they need when they need it.  The health checks have been required for a long time.  I hope we can get to the children who are in abusive cases or neglected much earlier in life.  That is a critical issue.<\/p><p> I also welcome the HSE statement on alcohol-related harm.  A policy is being developed where there will be no interaction with the drinks industry, which is welcome.  I hope the Departments of Health and Education and Science, as well as other Departments and the Child and Family Agency, will follow suit with a similar statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#G00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2575,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, must go to the Chamber to speak on the national dementia strategy so I ask her to briefly address her questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2576,"content":"<p>I will be brief as I do not have time to answer the questions as put.

I hope to get back here.  We are in negotiations about a range of vaccines and I know Deputy Conway has also put down a question on that.  As the negotiations are ongoing, we should allow them to happen.  That should not take forever.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, and I share those concerns.  We must remember that CAMHS is for people who are acutely unwell and outside of that, we should be able to take a deeper look at the waiting list - we have been doing that - to see where exactly people can be dealt with.  Perhaps it could be at the very early stages, as was suggested, so that people do not necessarily have to go to CAMHS.  We have much difficulty with recruitment.  I spoke to the director this morning and we have not been very successful in the recruitment process.  She can fill in the committee on that as well.  We are very conscious of the need for pathways to be clearer and access to be more immediate.  There is a programme being worked on because we can do much better.  When there are glaring gaps like we have had with personnel within the service, it is very difficult to deliver on our very high expectation.  We have reduced waiting times and are getting on top for the first time with bed allocation and inappropriate placement.  We have far more information on that now, which we did not have before.

Deputy Kelleher asked about the oversight implementation and recommendations.  It is a very pertinent question.  One of the specific eight recommendations made in the HIQA Portlaoise report is that the Department would set up a steering group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of that report.  I can commit that it will be done; there is a commitment led by the Department to oversee the implementation of all eight recommendations in the report.  This applies not just to the recommendations made to the Department but also those made to the HSE.<\/p> <p>  What is particularly helpful and strong about this report is the fact there are eight recommendations.  They are specific, measurable, achievable and realistic.  They can be time-bound.  What can be difficult with other reports, not just from HIQA but from other bodies in the past, is that there may be 70 or 200 recommendations that are not very specific or time-bound.  Sometimes they are not achievable.  That would put anybody in a very difficult position as it is arguable as to whether they could ever be implemented.  HIQA have set down a good marker by having eight very clear and doable recommendations that we can implement.  The truth is that, on occasion, sometimes HIQA has made recommendations that cannot be done.  With respect to ambulances, it specifically made a recommendation that would be in contravention of European law, and we would have to tender the ambulance to do what it recommends.  That is obviously not something we intend to do.  Sometimes the recommendations cannot be achieved because of financial limitations, and that is particularly the case with accident and emergency departments.  We are building a new accident and emergency department every year in Ireland because we can only afford to do that.  I wish we could build 20 new departments but we cannot.  That is the reason we are certainly behind on some of those recommendations regarding the emergency department in Tallaght that could be applied across the country.<\/p> <p>  There may also be problems with recruitment and sometimes it is hard to recruit people in filling certain posts, no matter how hard we try.  The fact that recommendations are not necessarily implemented does not mean they are being ignored.  Sometimes we are still working at trying to implement them.  We need to move to an approach of \"comply and explain\" with HIQA recommendations.  I have asked the Department to go through and audit all recommendations made over the past number of years and have a rolling programme of checking every couple of months where we are in implementing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#H00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2579,"content":"<p>Will the steering group have an independent chairperson outside the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#H00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2580,"content":"<p>We have not yet decided.  My plan is for it to be chaired by a Department official but I am open to views on that.  There should be independent input, particularly a patient representation.<\/p> <p>  I touched on the outpatient appointment issue.  There are 412,000 people now waiting for their first appointment with a consultant, although there could be a fair bit of double counting.  We will let the committee know about that.  It is always important with waiting list figures to drill down and 170,000 of those people are waiting less than 12 weeks.  In some cases they are waiting a few days.  That refers to anybody, in effect, who has been referred by their GP to a consultant.  It is not the case that they are all waiting inordinate lengths of time.  The figures may be confusing.  With the surgical area, the number of people waiting less than three months for a procedure is going up, for example, but the number of people waiting a long time is going up.  People are being seen quickly by efficient services that are turning people over quickly, leading to improvement, but particular sub-specialties have lists that are getting longer.  When I speak with people on waiting lists, they are not all that interested in whether they are number 100,000 or 106 on the list but rather how long they will have to wait.  That is why the focus is not so much on getting the numbers down, as every time a new service is established, there is a new waiting list for it.  There are waiting lists now in areas that did not exist two years ago.<\/p><p>My focus is on reducing waiting times so that people do not have to wait too long to see somebody.  That is why we have set these maximum tolerable limits - which should not be tolerable, but unfortunately, they are - of 18 months by June and 15 month by December.  I agree that we will need some help from the private sector and potentially even overseas in order to address some of those targets.  That will be expensive but it needs to be done.  It can be done through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which was used to eliminate the long waits for urgent colonoscopy procedures at the end of last year.  I have no problem doing that again if the budget is available to do so.  However, it does not necessarily have to be done by the NTPF in the old way as it can also be done directly by hospitals and groups which are already using the private sector to pick up some of their work.<\/p><p> For example, I refer to the very long waiting list for scoliosis operations for children which I find personally to be extremely worrying.  That is why we have allocated an extra &euro;1 million this year for this procedure.  We have had to use the Blackrock Clinic as well as Cappagh to deal with some of those cases.  However, there are limitations in that there are only so many theatres and so many surgeons.  We are putting a whole new theatre into Crumlin hospital even though it will be out of use in three years.  A constraining factor is the theatre space and the number of consultants who are trained to do the operations and this has caused us serious trouble.  We may need to send some cases overseas for these operations.<\/p><p> There is a bigger picture with regard to waiting times for appointments.  We need to reduce the number of referrals because, quite frankly, too many people are being referred to specialists.  The best way we can reduce referrals is to support GPs, have more referrals to generalists, build up primary care in particular and also have GPs taking a special interest in areas such as dermatology and ENT.  They can be trained up to deal with these areas of medicine.  This would allow for inter-practice referrals as is the case in other countries.  The e-referral system will mean better referrals.  It is really disheartening to hear of patients who wait a year to see a consultant and the consultant tells them he did not need to see them.  Better quality referrals using e-referrals, photograph referrals and video conferencing can all help.<\/p><p> We need proper adherence to chronological order and that is not always being done.  It is supposed to be urgent cases first and then all routine cases in order but that does not happen.  We need better IT systems in particular to ensure this does not happen.  We need to change the ratio of reviews to new patients.  At the moment in any clinic there is approximately one new patient for every three seen, or one to about 2.6 patients.  If that ratio is changed slightly, there would not be a need for more clinics.  More new patients would be seen and instead of a review every six months, it would be done every seven months or patients could be discharged back to their GP.  A slight change in the ratio with existing resources could actually transform the waiting list.  However, making that happen in every hospital and clinic in the country is very difficult, in particular when one is working from headquarters.  We need more consultants in many areas, in particular in some of the specialties such as dermatology, ENT, orthopaedics and others.  If it was a case of just having more consultants, the problem would have been solved a long time ago.  We have more consultants than ever in the health service.  However, it is a bigger piece that needs to be addressed; it has never been addressed properly and we are doing our best in that regard.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the closure of maternity units and he said it was premature to be discussing that issue.  It is probably premature to be talking about it and I accept that criticism.  However, I wish to make it clear that it is not ruled out in that it is part of what needs to be considered.  It is important to underline that this is not just a question of staffing; adequate patient numbers are required.  For example, if a unit has 2,000 births a year, that is three or four births a day.  When that one in a thousand case arrives, that unit probably has not seen such a case before and it is not sure what to do.  The nature of specialisation is that smaller centres can give more personal care but bigger centres are more used to dealing with those rare cases, those one in a thousand cases or those one in ten thousand cases.  Sometimes these cases can be picked up in advance and referred to the specialist centre but sometimes they are not picked up and that is the inherent nature of a smaller unit when it comes to a specialist service.  The same applies to emergency departments, to cancer treatment in the past and to many other conditions.<\/p><p> If I were to explain it very simply, 20 years ago medicine was very safe, very simple and it was not very effective.  Now it is very effective, very complex and potentially dangerous.  A person having a heart attack 20 years ago would have gone to the local hospital where they would probably not have been able to do very much for the person and any doctor could do it.  Now it is totally different.  For example, a particular type of heart attack, a STEMI, means a patient is taken by ambulance to a specialist centre where a specialist does primary PCI or else the patient is taken by helicopter in some cases.  If it is not that type of heart attack, the patient goes to a different centre which specialises in thrombolycis, a treatment that cannot be done in every hospital and never was or could be done in every hospital.  That is why there has to be a lot of changes.  Our job as politicians is to explain to people why the best care is not necessarily the nearest care and that it might be better to travel an hour or two to the right place rather than to have local care that is not up to standard.  <\/p><p> Another aspect to remember is that staff can become de-skilled, and this issue was raised in the HIQA report on surgery in Portlaoise.  If the surgeons are not doing complex surgery every day, they will not be as good at it.  It is the case that one will be better at something one does every day rather than what one does only once a week.  That is often the problem with smaller centres; it is often not lack of staff but rather lack of patients with those particular conditions and needs. <\/p><p> It must be borne in mind that even where there are staffing issues, the recruitment of skilled professionals is very difficult.  There is an international shortage of doctors, consultants, midwives and specialist nurses.  As a result they generally want to work in big centres attached to universities and centres of research.  There is a struggle to recruit to peripheral centres and this applies not only in Ireland.  It is not just a question of money; there are many reasons.  It will come to the point where we must ask if it is desirable that we are only keeping services open by staffing them with locums and agency workers who work for a week or two.  These are the questions we need to tackle as a country.  This was the situation with regard to cancer and it will be the case in other areas.  <\/p><p> On the question of maternity models, the strategy group will examine this in the round.  In my view there is a lot more space for midwife-led care and midwife-led units and a lot more space for the domino system which means mothers go home early from hospital.  There is more room for home births, within reason, if these can be done safely.  Therefore, there would be fewer hospital-based births and as the birth rate falls, we would need fewer hospital units.  It will not be possible to have the two systems.  More midwife-led care, birthing centres, community care and home births, along with fewer births overall, will mean we will hardly need the same number of maternity units.  That is just common sense and we need to be upfront about that.  <\/p><p> On the question about vaccines, no country in Europe as yet vaccinates its entire population or child population for meningitis B.  The UK will be the first country to do so later this year.  It is under consideration as part of the service plan for 2016 but it is not under consideration on its own in that other vaccines are available to be considered.  I refer to HPV for boys and men.  The rotovirus vaccine is not given in Ireland but it is given in other countries.  We must also consider the BCG vaccine because it has now been recommended by the experts that we no longer vaccinate everyone for TB and that only high-risk groups are vaccinated.  We will look at all the vaccines rather than one at a time in order to develop a package for the service plan for 2016.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout spoke about the satellite centres and I agree with her.  The planning permission for the children's hospital satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght will be submitted at the same time, which is this summer.  If planning permission is granted, they will be open in 2017, so the satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght will be open before the main hospital opens.  There will be a national network so every paediatric ward in the country will be linked into the children's hospital using the same IT system.  The satellite centres will be ambulatory.  For example, the Blanchardstown centre is a big three-storey building with a walk-in emergency department, outpatient department and other facilities.  The Tallaght centre will be similar.  In general, people will bring their children to these centres if a child has a bad chest or an injury and they will not go to the main campus because that will be the specialist centre, by and large.  <\/p><p> There are four stand-alone maternity hospitals, Holles Street, the Coombe, the Rotunda and St. Munchin's in Limerick.  The plan is to co-locate these hospitals with adult hospitals.  This can only be done one hospital at a time and Holles Street will be the first.  The planning application to move to the campus of St. Vincent's hospital will be submitted this summer.  The hospital will be on the campus but it will be separate from St. Vincent's hospital.  A decision remains to be made on where the Coombe, the Rotunda and St. Munchin's will go but that decision will be made in a matter of weeks.  The locations are obvious but we have to ensure that the decisions stand up, are supported by data and are not based on any political considerations.  We cannot have any allegations that decisions were taken on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#H00700","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431592200,"counter":2582,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleagues to respond on certain questions.  I will ask Mr. Liam Woods to comment on outpatient care and waiting lists generally.<\/p><p>Mr. Pat Healy will speak on the safeguarding policy and community rehabilitation, Ms Anne O'Connor on mental health services and Ms Laverne McGuinness on dental services and palliative care.  In response to the questions on maternity services and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s concern about the nature of care in large maternity units, approximately 40% of the babies born last year were born in large maternity units.  The three Dublin units are not associated with an absence of compassionate care.  They are associated with very high standards of care.  There should not be a suggestion that if there were to be a centralisation into larger units, it would be equated with a downgrading of the level of compassion and care.  That correlation does not exist at all.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Kelleher, who reminded me of the commitments made in the 2014 service plan, the quality and patient safety enablement programme identified has been established.  It intends to ensure there are differential focuses on quality improvement on the one hand and quality assurance and verification on the other.  That is having a significant impact on the system which all those who interact with it have recognised.  He also mentioned the issue of health care acquired infections.  When the latest performance assurance report is published shortly it will show for example that in Clostridium difficile, C. diff, we have the lowest recorded incidence at 2.1.  There are areas where progress is being made.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked specifically about the response to the publication of the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s report last February.  On the day of its publication a new manager and a new director of midwifery were installed in the maternity services in Portlaoise.  They are judged in the HIQA report to have made a very significant impact on the improvements that have occurred there, so much so, that, although it was described as a slightly innovative approach, HIQA has recommended the approach in general hospitals that have maternity services and that having a separate director of midwifery should be replicated.  That is a sign of confidence that initiative went through.  Two obstetricians have been appointed.  The Irish maternity early warning system, IMEWS, has been implemented on site.  In regard to the Dublin Mid-Leinster hospital group, in order to bring the strongest managerial focus I could to the group, I moved one of the most senior leaders in the HSE, Dr. Susan O&rsquo;Reilly, who was brought to this country to head the national cancer control programme, into that group, specifically to ensure it had the type of managerial and clinical leadership focus required to address the issues there.  That is also bearing considerable fruit.<\/p><p> The institution of a serious reportable events recommendation that the chief medical officer included in his report was implemented by my direction throughout the system from that day forward and it has since evolved, has been strengthened and is being audited.  There has been a significant response.  None of that of course is intended by me to take away from the fact that there were prior events from which there was insufficient learning and Deputy Kelleher referred to one of them.  The letter to staff I issued was a reflection of my reaction to the particular unbelievable experiences of patients, their families and bereaved parents in terms of how they were responded to at their time of greatest need.  It was intended to send a clear signal, which it did, that we can all, each of the 100,000 in the health service, do better than that. <\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked me in particular about my position on the HIQA report.  In terms of anything that went before, I had not seen, because it is not the practice that one would see, the recommendations of the HIQA report as part of a draft sent for fact checking and verification.  That is not how it is done.  Any comments I made about the report were not about the recommendations because I had not seen them.  I was briefed verbally on those recommendations this day last week and received them when I received the full copy.  I had and have absolutely no hesitation in agreeing with, supporting and committing to the implementation of the recommendations because I believe they will contribute to an improvement.<\/p><p> The issue I raised previously with HIQA was characterised here as threatening to injunct it, which I did not do.  I did raise the prospect of a judicial review in circumstances where I had been asked to provide feedback on a draft report, without sufficient information to enable me to do so.  I had on five occasions attempted to reach an engagement with those involved in order to overcome an impasse.  Ultimately, at my appeal, the Department of Health was able to facilitate an engagement where we overcame some of those issues, appropriate time was allowed and a comprehensive submission made to the HSE.  As to the extent of change, I do not think this is the time for that discussion.  At the moment it is appropriate to focus on the report itself.  My acceptance of the recommendation does not mean that I agree with every line in the report but that is not for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2584,"content":"<p>Would Mr. O&rsquo;Brien agree that it also looks particularly bad when two State agencies are involved in a public dispute over a very sensitive matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#K00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431592200,"counter":2585,"content":"<p>I think it is very unfortunate that one of the agencies chose to put it into the public domain.

Child protection arrangements are also in place.  Much has been done to develop this front, but there was a lacuna, in that vulnerable or disabled adults who were not elderly were not covered.  Following the establishment of the social care division, one of our first actions was to develop a safeguarding policy, which was published last December and is being rolled out.<\/p> <p>  The reference to a no-tolerance policy relates to the need for a change in culture.  There is a basic expectation that staff at all levels, be they in residential centres or communities, would engage compassionately and appropriately in terms of the care and support provided to the people with whom they engage.  However, we have learned and continue to learn that this is not always the case.  The no-tolerance policy is meant to drive home to providers and staff across the sector as well as to the public that there is an intention to change.  We are not just supporting this with the implementation of the safeguarding policy, which will see safeguarding teams across the nine community health care organisations.  Twenty additional social workers are being recruited for these teams, as are some of the principal social workers who will head them up, with the others already in post.  We will also support the no-tolerance policy through a six-step change programme and a volunteer advocacy programme, under which we will have residential counsels in our residential centres.  The idea is to open up our centres so that people can come in from the outside and there can be a general sense of engagement.<\/p> <p>  There is a dedicated team for the quality improvement programme.

We are working with the primary care division to examine this matter.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding that, there are a number of challenges for the specialist services.  The service improvement project is under way to improve access to and quality of CAMHS.  We have waiting lists, with a number of areas challenged in terms of children waiting for longer than 12 months.  We are addressing this issue with those areas.  However, a number of factors have an impact, for example, our capacity to recruit.  In terms of staffing, more than 50% of our CAMHS teams are working with less than 50% of what A Vision for Change recommended.  We are significantly challenged in terms of recruiting consultant psychiatrists.  Only in the past week have we heard that, of the three CAMHS and three mental health of intellectual disability, MHID, service posts advertised by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, not a single application was received.  This is concerning because we have services with no CAMHS consultants.  We must try to address this issue.<\/p> <p>  The CAMHS validation exercise has told us that approximately 20% of children referred to CAMHS and on waiting lists could be seen by primary care.  We have legacy issues to address in terms of how things work in areas.  For example, to access services, they come through CAMHS, which is unnecessary.  There are children sitting on waiting lists for educational assessments who do not need CAMHS.  We are trying to unpick all of this and to determine where children and young people need to be seen.<\/p> <p>  A specific point to make about the children referenced in those reports and the at-risk young people who are in the care of the State is that we are seeking to develop a CAMHS forensic team from the 2015 development funding.

Yesterday, there were 42 patients on trolleys in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  It was the second highest number in the country.  What plans are in place to reduce these numbers?  The Minister monitors the trolley situation on a daily basis, but the problem in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is serious.<\/p> <p>  At the beginning of April, the Minister's Department approved additional funding of &euro;74 million to reduce delays in discharges.  That was welcome.  Some &euro;44 million was provided for the fair deal scheme, which the Minister stated would result in an additional 1,600 places, and &euro;30 million was allocated to provide 250 rehabilitative beds in community and district hospitals.  I welcome the decrease in the fair deal waiting list from 11 weeks to an average of four weeks.  I am pleased to see that County Louth's two hospitals - Our Lady of Lourdes and Louth County Hospital - are working closely together, sharing facilities and opening up roads to help alleviate the problem at the former.

Obesity is a timebomb that is ready to explode.  Nearly two thirds of us are obese or overweight.  It is putting our children at risk.  We lack self-awareness of body size.  It is costing us millions of euro and increasing the risk of cancers, including bowel, kidney, womb and breast to name but a few.  It is causing heart and diabetes problems, damaging our joints and increasing the likelihood of developing varicose veins.  It gives one a sense of being unattractive and reduces one's self-confidence.  I plead with the Minister to intervene in the obesity issue.  I am the committee's rapporteur on obesity.  We will do anything to help.<\/p> <p>  The situation is getting out of control.  Ireland's is one of the worst in Europe, perhaps even in the world.  This is an important issue.  In fairness to the Minister, he has done a fantastic job since entering office.  I like that he is open, honest and says things like he sees them.  The situation is very serious.  For the past four or five years, all I have seen is people promising, promising and promising.  Deputy Varadkar is the type of Minister who does not make false promises.  I ask him for a full commitment to help combat obesity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#L01000","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2601,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Mr. O'Brien for their presentations.  I will touch on the Portlaoise report briefly.  There are 19 maternity units around the country.  Is information available on the perinatal mortality rate for all 19 units?<\/p><p>It is important to reassure people.  There are 19 units and there are people working who are concerned and it is important that the information is put out there.  The second issue raised in the Portlaoise report was that the State Claims Agency was aware of concerns at Portlaoise hospital, but there seems to have been no mechanism between the agency and the Department to ensure there was a response to those growing concerns.  Is there now a mechanism in place should a situation arise in another hospital facing a large number of claims?  What are we doing where one agency knows there is a problem, but another is not reacting?  Is there a mechanism to allow the former to go directly to the Department?<\/p><p> The second issue I raise relates to the Cork-Kerry area.  I have been made aware in the last few days that there was an agreement that 30 vacancies in relation to public health nurses and community nurses would be filled.  I have also been made aware in the last two days that this has been put back and long-fingered.  Can that be clarified?  It may not be possible to do so today, but I ask it be done.  We need these people out there in the community.  They do very good work, but there are more than 30 vacancies in the Cork-Kerry region which have been open for some time notwithstanding the agreement that they be filled.<\/p><p> The third issue is the response to my fifth question, which was on junior doctors.  I have been raising this issue for four years, but we have not made a huge amount of progress.  The response to my question states that there are 2,943 doctors on structured training programmes.  While they may be on structured training programmes, they are not on contracts as such.  A number of junior doctors are still moving around on training programmes and six month contracts and are on emergency tax every six months.  We seem to have made no progress in the last four years in real terms.  I also raise the issue concerning junior doctors in Cork University Hospital of the absence of Internet access in the doctors' residence.  The library access is insufficient for them.  They are studying and training and providing a service, but we cannot provide a simple service to them notwithstanding that we want them to stay in the country.  We are not making a great deal of progress.  We need these people.  We need good people to stay here but we are not putting the incentives in place.  We have now had two reports from MacCraith and another lot of reports is being put on a shelf to be dealt with at some stage in the future.  We are not making enough progress.  Now is the time to start dealing with this issue so that when someone is on a five-year programme, he or she has a contract and does not go onto emergency tax.  It should not be a case of six-month contracts.  It is something with which we need to deal if we want to make serious progress on the retention of very good people in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#L01100","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2603,"content":"<p>I want to say something on Portlaoise hospital.  I listened to media reports this morning on what I understand was a long and emotive meeting last night between the Minister and the families.  One comment struck me which was that the Minister heard from families whose cases date back to the 1980s.  That is alarming.  The Minister stated in his opening remarks that to care costs nothing.  I am not trying to pre-empt anything, but it sounds to me that there is an appalling culture in the hospital.  It is as we have seen in all of the expos&eacute;s of recent months, be it child care services or &Aacute;ras Attracta.  A culture emerges and is somehow approved by a failure to speak up.  If we do anything as a Government, we must break that kind of culture that starts to embed itself in organisations and places where often vulnerable people - and pregnant women are very vulnerable - go as a place of safety.  It is alarming in that regard to think that we are talking about cases dating back over 30 years.  I will leave it there as we are to have another meeting on Tuesday to discuss this.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in Mr. O'Brien's opening remarks on PPCI services.  There is an ongoing PPCI national capacity study, which includes Waterford.  We are told it is due to be completed shortly.  How long more are we going to have to wait on this?  If Mr. O'Brien could provide us with a timeline, I would greatly appreciate it.  As he understands, the lack of a 24-7 cardiology service at University Hospital Waterford is of huge concern, not just to people in Waterford but throughout the south east due to our geography and issues of proximity to other PPCI centres.<\/p> <p>  I am very disappointed in the reply to my question on academic appointments for University Hospital Waterford.  The response states that the Higgins report does not indicate the introduction of these posts at the hospital.  However, I have a press release from the HSE's website dated 16 May 2014 in which the former Minister, Deputy James Reilly, in renaming the hospital in the presence of Ambrose McLoughlin, the then Secretary General, and, I understand, the President of UCC, Dr. Michael Murphy, stated that five academic posts would be provided at University Hospital Waterford.  We have heard from other colleagues about the importance of ensuring that our junior hospital doctors and trainee medical students have all they need to ensure they are trained and get the utmost from their placements and internships in our hospitals.  Frankly, I am beginning to think University Hospital Waterford was just a name change.  It means nothing unless we get our academic posts that were agreed on and promised by Ambrose McLoughlin, Deputy Reilly and the President of UCC.<\/p> <p>  My last question is on speech and language services.  It has come to my attention from encounters with a great many people that when children reach age six, their access to speech and language therapy changes.  If the child is lucky enough to be a member of an early years service, he or she has access.  Once the child turns six, however, he or she reverts to the community care service.  The numbers are alarming given how few speech and language therapists we have in Waterford in comparison to neighbouring areas like Carlow-Kilkenny and Wexford.  That is despite the fact that we have the highest number of patients waiting to be seen by therapists.  In Carlow-Kilkenny, there are 11.7 therapists who are working with 907 people.  In Waterford, we have 9.8 whole-time equivalents but 2,361 people, often young people, who are waiting to be seen.  In Wexford, there are 18 posts with only 2,246 people.  It is a huge disparity.  What is happening in that regard?  Children are coming through the early intervention teams and by the time they get to school, they regress because the services are no longer there.  It is not something we can stand over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#M00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2604,"content":"<p>I want to pick up on what Deputy Ciara Conway said about speech and language therapy.  I have asked on a number of occasions over the years for the Minister for Health to look at this and deliver a service through our national primary school network.  What is happening is that parents get appointments which they cancel or fail to turn up for and the child may not be seen again for six months.  If the therapist arrived at the school, the principal will be there and can ensure the child gets the therapy.  It would be a huge improvement for children.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the Minister on the scheme he has launched to bring nurses home.<\/p><p>I have been asked to raise as issue that is causing major worry in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  One nursing home had to close last week because it could not find qualified nurses.  Nursing homes recruit nurses from abroad, but when they gain experience, hospitals take them on.  The nursing home in question is back at square one, having to recruit more nurses.  Nursing homes have identified a solution to the problem - fast-tracking registration.  It takes a long time - I have been 12 months - for nurses from abroad to get onto the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, register and obtain their PIN from An Bord Altranais, the Irish nursing board.  It would help if that process was fast-tracked.<\/p><p> I am delighted with the Minister's proposed action plan to tackle obesity.  Perhaps he might have a word with the Minister for Finance about introducing a sugar tax, with the revenue raised to be ringfenced to treat people with diabetes and other problems associated with obesity.  <\/p><p> The treatment of junior doctors is disgraceful.  These highly educated qualified doctors must attend for interview every six months and have to move around the country.  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of their being put on emergency tax.  They are treated with disdain.  As they have to move around the country, they cannot make any family decision.  I do not know of any other group of qualified professionals who are treated as badly as junior doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#M00300","speaker":"1004","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2606,"content":"<p>I know that I have the opportunity to talk about the Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, but looking at it from a clinician's perspective, it looks like the basic interchange between two entities, with one administrative organisation criticising the other for what its perceives as an inadequate administrative response.  I do not think that is a high priority.  The problem is not unique to Portlaoise; it is emblematic of a set of broader problems in the health service which require fundamental structural change.  I know that I sound like a broken record, but a big chunk of the problem is due to the number of specialists involved.  I am grateful for the detailed answer to my question.  According to the numbers, we have probably the lowest number of career level obstetricians per head of population of any country in the western world.  Some 10% of obstetrician jobs, according to the figures provided today, are occupied by locums.  This understates the disproportionate distribution of the problem.  I suspect there are very few locums in the three Dublin hospitals and in the hospitals in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  I could be wrong, but I suspect that in smaller units there is a disproportionate utilisation of locum services.  No matter how well trained locums are, it is not as satisfactory an arrangement as having somebody who is providing for continuity of care throughout the entire course and trajectory of a pregnancy and in the provision of after care.  Those who go on to have a number of children may want to have a consultant who is aware of their obstetrical problems from prior pregnancies.  It is not a good arrangement.<\/p> <p>  The Minister comes very close to identifying the problem when he states it appears to him that some units are so unattractive to Irish graduates who are training, by and large, in international centres of excellence that they cannot recruit them to work and that as a result the jobs are being filled by locums, which is leading to the conclusion that perhaps the units might not be viable.  I would like the Minister to think of an alternative explanation because there is one.  The basic currency, for want of a better word, that determines the viability of an obstetrical unit is the number of births.  The question is whether there are units which deal with an insufficient number of births that it is not possible to have sufficient obstetric, paediatric, midwifery and ICU resources to provide modern 21st century care and, if so, whether these units should be closed down.  It is that simple.  If that is the logic of what the Minister is saying, I would absolutely support him in gutting the number of units in the country and closing them down.  However, it is not true.  There were approximately 2,000 births in Portlaoise last year, or about six every day, which is enough to support a well staffed unit with enough obstetricians to provide attractive jobs for those who want to come back from the leading centres of excellence and with their own paediatric special care baby unit and on-site 24 hour intensivist paediatrician.  This is not a remote part of rural British Columbia where people are spread over thousands of miles.  This is a concentrated area in which there is a large number of births and which should have its own proper modern obstetric service.  If we cannot attract good people to it, it is not because there are not enough births but because we have made a decision that the unit will not be adequately staffed. <\/p> <p>  I asked a question about medical schools and I am a little less happy with the quality of the answer I have been given.  I am very interested in knowing how many are actually employed full time by medical schools working as academics at consultant level in the clinical specialties of internal medicine.  The figures I have been given are not reflective of this but reflect people who have health service jobs because their job is based in a teaching hospital and have a degree of entitlement as \"academics\".  The numbers I have been given do not add up.  I will not go into all of the details today, but I believe the number of doctors employed in medical schools as full-time academics with dominant clinical academic components to their jobs is very small.  We need to get to the bottom of this issue.  It is hard to justify giving priority to reforming the medical school sector when there is no major constituency for this reform.  Therefore, it is hard for politicians to see it as a high priority at a time when people have to wait for two years on a waiting list and deaf children sit at the back of the class and are not able to have their ears tested for six months at a time.  We have six medical schools; we have twice as many per head of population as the European average and three times as many per head of population as in the United States, with an entirely inadequate level of staff.  I have to be careful about how I say this, but I suspect that a very rigorous scrutiny by external agencies of the education service provided in these medical schools might result in greater urgency to fix them.  <\/p> <p>  I am very grateful to Mr. O'Brien for clarifying the issues in respect of percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention.  He needs to know a little about the hospital group idea.  A hospital group is a good idea if we get the reforms right; however, it is not if we do not.  It appears to have been ignored in the way services are being organised in Dublin.  The Mater hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital made a proposal to form one hospital group, with one university and one medical school.  The very large cohort of cardiologists in the two hospitals who are very good and very experienced decided that they wanted to be seen as one entity for transluminal coronary interventions.  They would work a 24 hour, seven day a week and weekend rota, but they were turned down.  They are a little confused and cannot quite understand the reason for this.  For hospitals which have not traditionally worked well together, becoming involved in hospital groups involves a certain degree of compromise.  They believe this compromise is not being rewarded in dealing with the specifics of this issue and that it is not laid out as logically as it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#N00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2607,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a number of issues.  Will the Minister and the director general of the HSE set out what they see as the short-term and medium to long-term future of the accident and emergency unit in Navan hospital?  It seems that there are mixed messages.  One day it is proposed that the unit will remain open and the next that it be turned into a minor injuries unit.  We know what the overall plan is.  A related question is whether a regional hospital for the north east is on the agenda of the Government and the HSE.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have responsibility for the provision of SNAs in preschools in County Meath.  Funding is an issue in this respect and the usual fight to retain funding was partially successful.  What was said to one of the parents involved was that if the HSE continued to fund SNAs in preschools in County Meath, a child who was sick or dying would have to be turned down for a home care package.  This immediately brought to mind what the HSE had stated openly that somebody else would have to lose out because of the allocation of resources to a person who needed Soliris.<\/p><p>The parents who heard this were very upset and it has caused consternation.  They certainly do not want to see one child being pitted against another.  I thought it was a terrible way to deal with matters.

We had a very interesting session with HIQA yesterday.  I come to this from a personal point of view because I have met the families in Portlaoise.  After the \"Prime Time Investigates\" broadcast, I brought Roisin and Mark Molloy to meet members of the health committee in January 2014.  At the time I was eight months pregnant.  When I had my baby, I had precisely the same experience as the Molloys - a very difficult labour with the baby's heart rate dropping.  I was under the care of Professor Mick Foley and an amazing team in Holles Street, but all that went through my mind during that experience was, \"Thank God I am in Holles Street\".  When things went seriously wrong, the staff, the care and the attention to detail saved my baby's life.  If the families in Portlaoise had received the level of care I did, their babies would also be alive.  That is a stark reality which I find deeply upsetting.  I take the Minister at his word and hope this will not be another report which sits on a shelf.  There have been so many reports over recent years relating to the health service and maternity services that it is difficult to have the confidence that anything will be different on this occasion.<\/p> <p>  The perinatal mortality statistics are completely inaccurate.  Dr. Tony Holohan's report made that finding last year.  Could the Minister let the committee know what precise plans are in place to make the reporting of baby deaths in maternity services mandatory and will there be criminal liability for hospitals and individuals who do not report? A voluntary system does not work.  I note that the policy on open disclosure is now being rolled out through a substantial number of hospitals, but it is still a voluntary process.  What does the Minister envisage for the mandatory nature of that?  What will the sanctions be for those who do not participate fully and openly in the process and when will the legislation appear?<\/p> <p>  It is cause for concern that many of these issues were raised by parents directly with senior individuals within the HSE throughout 2012.  There was no real satisfactory response.  What is the role of the national incident management team?  It expressed concern internally in November and December 2012 and that was not acted upon.  Letters were written by parents, and in particular by Mark and Roisin Molloy, to Mr. Tony O'Brien, the director general of the HSE.  These received vague responses and nothing was done until after the \"Prime Time\" documentary.  It is frustrating that those responsible for the care of citizens can abdicate responsibility until the scandal is unearthed on an RTE programme.  There is public humiliation of the services and then people own up and express remorse.  The committee discussed this scandal with HIQA.  Failures were identified locally, regionally and nationally.  Four members of staff at a hospital are to be referred for disciplinary sanction, but who is responsible at regional and national level?  Is Mr. O'Brien responsible?  Does he intend to fall on his sword and be answerable for what has happened?  Repeated letters and requests for meetings by the families were ignored until the \"Prime Time Investigates\" documentary.  Somebody has to answer, at a national level, for a dysfunctional and negligent system which encourages cover-up rather than transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#O00600","speaker":"1204"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2613,"content":"<p>I will ask the director general to speak about the information sharing between the HSE and the State Claims Agency which is important.  I will ask the chief medical officer to discuss the plans for open disclosure and the decision made between mandatory and protected disclosure.  He will also expand on the issue of figures for perinatal mortality rates, which unfortunately give false reassurance.<\/p> <p>  Based on figures from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, there were 42 patients on trolleys yesterday morning or 35 based on the SDU figures.  As the nurses' union's own website confirms, their figures include people who are not on trolleys - people in beds, in day wards or surgical wards - patients who may not be in the right ward but are certainly not on a trolley.  Nonetheless, 35 based on our figures is still unacceptable.  By 8 p.m. last night, that figure was down to 16, of whom only eight had been on a trolley for more than nine hours, so it does change during the day, and that is the nature of an emergency department.<\/p> <p>  Beds have been opened in Moorehall nursing home and patients from the Louth hospitals have been moved there.  Navan and Dundalk have been used also to relieve Drogheda.  There are the additional fair deal places, but even where there is funding for fair deal, the shortage of nursing homes in the Louth-Meath area is a problem.  We need more nursing homes built, but that will not be done quickly.  They are also getting additional home care packages which allows more patients to go home.  In June or July 2015, a new modular ward will provide an additional 20 beds for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  In a logical world, if there are 35 patients on trolleys in the morning and 16 by the evening, an extra 20 beds should mean it will be down to 15 in the morning and none in the evening.  That is not going to happen and it is a concern that one can add more and more bed capacity to a hospital and it does not bring down the numbers on trolleys - there are so many other dynamics.  Admission rates vary and in some hospitals one is twice as likely to be admitted as in others, even though they are similar hospitals.  The duration of a hospital stay can vary between hospitals.  Often, when there are no people waiting on trolleys, there is less pressure to get tests done quickly or to discharge patients quickly.  People may be brought in unnecessarily on some occasions.  I have been there - I have been a doctor in the hospital where we were encouraged to admit everyone and also in the hospital where we were discouraged from admitting unnecessarily.  There are many factors and I do not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that we just need more beds.<\/p><p>If it was just down to that, the problem would have been solved a long time ago.  We have started a programme in Tallaght called the Irish hospital redesign programme which applies management techniques such as lean six sigma to hospitals.  The programme is starting to work in Tallaght and if it proves successful, Drogheda might be one of the sites to which we will extend it next.  It is all about patient pathways and making better use of what we already have before we add an extra 1,000 beds because if the beds are not used correctly they will never be enough.<\/p><p> I have to prioritise the public health (alcohol) Bill 2015 but we intend to prepare a new action plan on obesity by the end of the year.  Two weeks ago we had a good discussion on this issue in Farmleigh with Professor Donal O'Shea and staff from McKinsey who carried out international research, among others.  The message I took from the discussion is that no single action will work.  The list is topped by issues like portion size reformulation but taxes are far down it.  We will require a cross-sectoral action plan which includes policies on physical education and snacks in schools.  Health policy will clearly be a major element, however.  Children who are signed up for GP care for under six year olds will receive two obesity checks per year.  It will be important that we put in place referral systems so that something can be done if obesity is identified.  We will need to introduce legislation on calory posting, marketing and product placement.  The jury is still out on the sugar tax, however.  Mexico has introduced such a tax and several other countries are completing research into whether it works.  If it works, we should introduce it but if it does not there are more efficient ways to raise revenue.<\/p><p> Deputy Conway asked about the meeting I attended last night.  As this was a private meeting and I assured people of confidentiality, I will not recount anything that they might have said.  I commend those who attended on their courage and strength and thank them for sharing their experiences with me, the Chief Medical Officer, the new CEO of the hospital group and my departmental officials so that we might learn from them.  It was a valuable exercise for that reason.  Some of the issues raised were specific to Portlaoise and they are being addressed.  However, other issues were more systemic.  If we were to go back 20 years to meet 100 patients who had bad experiences in Waterford or Blanchardstown hospital, the discussion might have been very similar because people have bad experiences in all hospitals, including tertiary referral and national specialist centres.  Much of the discussion concerned the quality of care received but equally there was concern about the way people were treated afterwards, both in terms of how professionals communicated with them initially and how their complaints were dealt with by management subsequently.  This is why I think an independent patient advocacy service would make a huge difference.  Somebody would be available to listen to patients, take their side and guide them through a difficult process laden with unnecessary officialdom, medical jargon and defensiveness.  That could drive a change of culture in our health service to make it more focused on patient experience.  This is something I want to achieve in the next couple of months.<\/p><p> Deputy Conway also asked about the five additional academic posts in University Hospital Waterford.  The Department is keen to support linkages between the hospital groups and their academic partners and careful consideration is being given to any service implications that might arise from these posts in the context of the strategic plan currently being prepared by the south and south west hospital group.  The cost of the five posts is &euro;1.4 million per year.  That amount of money would allow us to staff the new Waterford hospice for the best part of a year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#O00700","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2615,"content":"<p>Do that first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#P00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2616,"content":"<p>The planning permission is in and the money is available in the capital plan.

An issue also remains outstanding in respect of academic contracts, however.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. O'Brien to address the issue of speech and language therapy.  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's suggestion that we should assign speech and language therapists to schools should be seriously considered.<\/p> <p>  The chief nursing officer's office is engaging with Nursing Homes Ireland to develop solutions on the shortage of nurses.  When it comes to nursing, everyone is poaching from each other.  The hospitals poach from the nursing homes and I even hear advertisements from Beacon Hospital offering hello money to nurses if they come to work for it.  That is a general symptom of the shortage of nurses in the country.  I will be investing considerable effort into the UK recruitment campaign in the coming months, as well as developing a package of measures to encourage this year's graduate class to stay here.  It is a good thing that people go overseas for a year or two to get experience but we want more to stay this year than was the case last year.<\/p> <p>  Senator Crown is correct that 2,000 births per year is an adequate volume to provide safe care in low to moderate risk pregnancies.  Some units are below that threshold.  However, it is not an adequate figure for tertiary or national specialty units.  Recruitment remains a struggle for smaller units.  The solution for Portlaoise is to put it under the governance of the Coombe, which allows joint appointments to be made.  I am not sure if a joint appointment has been made yet but we have given approval for two joint appointments in obstetrics and two joint appointments in paediatrics.  As the Coombe is only an hour away from Portlaoise by road, they are feasible as a joint appointment.  NCHDs will also rotate between the two hospitals, which means that if somebody has a two-year post in the Coombe, he or she might spend six months of it in Portlaoise.  The Coombe has been very helpful in this regard and I thank the master of the Coombe, Dr. Sharon Sheehan, and the board of the hospital for taking this on.  If it is successful, it might become a model for other smaller units.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to dwell on the primary percutaneous coronary intervention issue but I understand that St. Vincent's proposed to work together with the Mater to provide a 24-7 hour rota between the two sites.  The ambulance service had a problem with this aspect of the proposal in particular because of the risk that confusion would arise as to where patients should be brought on a particular day of the week.  This is why the decision was made to operate from two sites in the greater Dublin area, St. James's and the Mater.<\/p> <p>  There are no plans at present to end 24-7 emergency department services from Navan hospital but the hospital groups will need to develop strategic plans for reconfigured services in the future.  A regional hospital in the north east only makes sense if the five existing hospitals are closed or downgraded.  That would be a politically difficult and controversial decision but it would also be questionable given that we are investing considerable resources into Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  One would wonder if it is a good idea to build a regional hospital in Navan if it means downgrading or closing Our Lady of Lourdes.  There is no funding in the budget for such a proposal but it has not been ruled out as a possibility in the future.<\/p> <p>  The number of people with health insurance increased by 80,000 so far this year, including 76,000 who signed up in the past few weeks.  We have received the results of the HIA's initial work on universal health insurance but I do not yet have a report from the ESRI, although I am due to receive it shortly.  Regardless of whether universal health insurance is in place, loadings can still apply.  One could argue, on the one hand, that as universal health insurance is compulsory there should be no loadings or, on the other, loadings can be applied to those who did not have health insurance for a period of time before its introduction in order to reward those who have already paid into the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#P00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2617,"content":"<p>Is that different from what the Department argued previously?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#P00400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2618,"content":"<p>It is different because we could approach it from either perspective.  That decision remains to be made.  Senator Gilroy asked about the suicide strategy.  The strategy is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It has been considered by the Cabinet sub-committee and we intend to bring it to Cabinet in the next week or two, following which the Minister of State will publish it at a time of her choosing.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to address the specific questions on Portlaoise.  Deputy Creighton said that she found it difficult to have confidence in reports which end up being left on the shelf.  I understand her scepticism about the potential for HIQA reports making any difference.<\/p><p>However, they do make a difference.  The report on cancer misdiagnosis has made a major difference and totally changed cancer diagnosis.  We have reduced the number of centres from 30 to eight and are achieving much better, and constantly improving, outcomes.  The reports on the nursing homes, particularly on Leas Cross made a difference.  While standards in our nursing homes are far from perfect, they are much better than they were five or six years ago when we were hearing horror stories about nursing homes all the time.  We are hearing about the disability care homes only now because HIQA regulations started in 2013.  These problems did not begin in 2013.  The problems in our care homes and the way residents have been treated must have been going on for decades.  The difference now is that HIQA goes in, produces and publishes reports and the system is forced to act.  It will result in a major improvement in the quality and standards in the coming years.<\/p><p> The hygiene reports make a major difference.  MRSA rates are at their lowest ever recorded, although this is not just down to HIQA hygiene reports.  The report on the ambulance service is making a difference and is the reason there is an extra &euro;5 million for ambulances this year, there are three new ambulance bases and we are centralising control in Tallaght, which will be fully up and running within months.  While I understand the scepticism due to the failure to implement some recommendations, which happens, let us not ignore the enormous amount of work being done by those who are implementing recommendations in ambulance services, hygiene, hospital acquired infections and nursing homes.  It has made an enormous difference, and it should be recognised.  Although it was not the Deputy's intention, we should not discount or denigrate all the work done by those people who have taken HIQA recommendations on board and made a significant difference for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#P00500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431592200,"counter":2620,"content":"<p>We have provisional perinatal mortality data for 2014, which we got from the national perinatal reporting system.  Deputy Creighton mentioned the work we did last year on perinatal statistics.  We have discovered that perinatal outcomes and deaths are reported through four mechanisms, namely, the national perinatal reporting system, which was with the Central Statistics Office and has moved to the HSE; the HSE's National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre, which was recently established following the Lourdes inquiry and which is based in Cork; the CSO, which reports on statistics; and the General Register Office, GRO.  Not surprisingly, with four different systems, we get four different answers, for reasons that are complex but explicable.  They relate to the variations between the systems, how they get their data and the mandatory nature of the reporting.<\/p> <p>  Among the recommendations we made as a consequence of some of the analysis we did last year was to make mandatory the notification of early neonatal deaths, which was not a requirement under the Civil Registration Act.  The Department of Social Protection amended the Act in 2014 as a consequence of this piece of work, and a set of regulations is to be commenced to bring the provision into force.  There is a recommendation on standardising a single, common definition of perinatal death.  If we end up with different reporting systems each producing what appears to be a different answer to the same question, it undermines public confidence in our collective ability to describe.  The one outstanding one remains for the HSE regarding the bringing together of the national perinatal reporting system and the NPEC which use different processes and methods and have different answers on perinatal mortality levels.<\/p> <p>  I would like to strike a note of caution regarding the interpretation of perinatal mortality statistics.  The statistics have a value, which is reassuring, especially at national level, where they show that we stand up well in comparison with other countries, notwithstanding what I said about the variations between the reporting methods.  When one examines smaller units and hospital level data, the numbers on which it is based are much smaller and the variation between centres is not picked up in a way that will show statistical significance.  This can lead to an over-reliance on clinical staff and undue reassurance being taken from a rate when there were many other issues that might have suggested there were problems that were not being taken into account.  I encountered this in Portlaoise.<\/p> <p>  The perinatal mortality rate should be seen as an alarm, not a description of a standard of care.  It tells us we should look further.  A perinatal mortality rate which is reassuring in the context of a series of so-called never events and a rise in adverse events, etc. is like saying the fire alarm is not ringing and ignoring the evidence that there is a fire.  Undue reliance on perinatal mortality statistics can lead to a situation in which people are not as open as they might be to the possibility that things are not as reassuring as the perinatal mortality rates might suggest.  This is why we made a recommendation around so-called patient safety statements in order that on a monthly basis some of the kinds of information about which I have spoken, including increases in adverse incidents, staff numbers, increased numbers of births, which happened in Portlaoise, and a range of other information, can be examined as means of quickly identifying safety problems rather than relying, particularly at the small unit level, on data that are produced only once a year in arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1431592200,"counter":2621,"content":"<p>I raise it because of all the coverage of Galway, Ballinasloe, Portlaoise and Cavan.

It is a very good policy, and stands up to the standard of policies around open disclosure to be found anywhere.  The question that arises is the extent to which any additional benefit arises from mandating open disclosure.  Our expectations should be that, through the open disclosure policies, staff will always deal in an appropriate way with patients and be honest and open when things go wrong.  Patient safety depends on creating the kind of environment in which professionals will be honest and open with patients in the first instance when things go wrong, explain it to them and deal with them appropriately.  It does not always happen.  Part of this is creating an environment in which health professionals can feel supported in participating in a range of activities that can improve quality and patient safety, including clinical audit, other quality assurance arrangements, adverse event reporting and open disclosure.  We intend to build into our health information Bill, which is part of our set of proposals, when it is published shortly, protections from access to this kind of information through freedom of information and data protection that will give health professionals an assurance that if they participate honestly and openly in these processes, the information will not be used against them in freedom of information.  It is about creating the sense of a culture which is not about imposing requirements on professionals and mandating them to do things but giving them a sense that they are supported in doing the right thing, which in this case is being set out in the open disclosure policy in the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431592200,"counter":2625,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Woods to comment on the acute sector issues, especially the timeline on the PPCI process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015051400002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431592200,"counter":2626,"content":"<p>I note Senator Crown&rsquo;s comments on PPCI.

We are trying to develop an integrated approach which takes account of school services, voluntary service provision and the service provided by the Health Service Executive.  These are the progressing disability services for children and young people aged from birth to 18 years.  The governance for this programme has been introduced following extensive consultation over the past year.  Additional posts will be provided in the current year.  This year, the south east will receive a proportion of the 120 additional posts to which I referred because the programme is ready to proceed.

We are working jointly with the Department of Education and Skills and making progress across the disability and primary care areas.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenges, particularly in the area of disability, has been the tendency among special schools or classes which have access to services to hold the service for the children to whom it is being provided.

Children will then be referred on an agreed basis and will receive a service on the basis of need, rather than having to depend on the service available to their school.  A proper referral pathway will be provided.  This service will require additional resources.  It is a positive development that 80 posts were provided in 2014.

This pressure coincided with the time when we needed to retain a degree of agency employment to cope with particular demand.

It is a privilege.  In my opening remarks I will draw the committee's attention to the process by which Ireland generally ratifies UN human rights treaties, with reference to some of the core treaties Ireland has ratified over the years, and what we can learn from this process as we move forward to prepare to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.<\/p> <p>  It is important to outline the legal status of UN treaty ratification for Ireland.  When Ireland signs a human rights treaty at the UN, it does not agree to be bound by that treaty, but is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty, according to the Vienna Convention.  According to the same convention, states are deemed to have ratified a treaty when the state&rsquo;s representative deposits the instruments of ratification with the UN.  Many UN human rights conventions also have an associated optional protocol, which usually facilitates individual rights holders from states parties to make complaints directly to the UN if they feel their human rights under the particular convention have been violated by the state.<\/p> <p>  All states, including Ireland, are free to determine their own internal process to prepare for the ratification of a UN treaty or optional protocol.  In Ireland, generally the procedure when signing or ratifying a UN treaty is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade brings a proposal to Government.  The Minister and the Government will often seek legal advice from the Attorney General on whether there is any legal or constitutional impediment to ratification.<\/p> <p>  While it is the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring forward a proposal for ratification, individual Departments can request the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to expedite this process.  This approach has been taken successfully to a number of treaties, for example, with regard to Ireland's ratification of the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  In that case, in 2000 the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform requested the advice of the Attorney General and was satisfied that no legal or constitutional impediment existed to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of this protocol.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality requested that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expedite the process to ratify the optional protocol and ratification occurred the same year, 2000.<\/p><p> Once the proposal for ratification has been approved by the Minister and by the Government, Ireland's representatives at the UN can then deposit the necessary instruments of ratification.  Following ratification, Article 29.5 of the Constitution provides that every international agreement to which the State becomes a party, should be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In effect, the Parliament is only involved in the process once the Executive - the Minister and the Government - has decided that a treaty will be ratified.  It is the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure all international agreements to which the State is a party are laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann promptly.  This has been expedited in recent years.  Since 2004, the target is for all international agreements which have entered into force for Ireland in a given calendar year to be laid before the D&aacute;il no later than the end of the following calendar year.<\/p><p> From the process I have outlined, it is clear that the Oireachtas does not play a significant role in determining whether Ireland should ratify any particular international agreement and there is only an opportunity for parliamentary debate on the matter once the Government has already made the decision to ratify.  The Council of Europe has developed an Assembly Resolution 1823 (2011) which states that national parliaments should play a greater role in the implementation of international human rights norms at national level and that this can be done, for example, through their involvement in the ratification of international human rights treaties.<\/p><p> In the past, Ireland has tended to sign many UN human rights treaties shortly after their adoption, but in most cases Ireland has not speedily ratified these conventions.  For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, were adopted by the UN in 1966, signed by Ireland in 1973 but not ratified until 1990.  The Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was also adopted by the UN in 1966 and signed by Ireland in 1968 but not ratified until 2001.  I could list many other examples but it is important to note that Ireland has improved its timeframe for ratification of UN conventions in recent years, in particular, between 1990 and 2002, when Ireland ratified the majority of the UN conventions.  This might be attributed to a growing awareness of human rights in Ireland during that timeframe with Ireland's incorporation into domestic law of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Therefore, while it took Ireland longer to ratify some of the older UN human rights conventions from the 1960s and 1970s, the current climate of human rights awareness in Ireland means that ratification of newer UN human rights conventions should be smoother and also speedier.  A good example is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which was adopted by the UN in 1989 and ratified by Ireland in 1992.  The entire process, from the UN concluding that convention to Ireland's ratification, took a mere three years.<\/p><p> While it is up to each individual state to determine when it is ready to ratify a particular human rights convention, Ireland has taken the approach that it does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary, as stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in the D&aacute;il in 2014 in response to questions as to when Ireland might ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  However, the determination of whether Ireland is in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty, tends to vary.  For example, when Ireland ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1986, rape within marriage was not prohibited by the criminal law.  In my view, Ireland was not at that time in a position to comply with the convention's provisions on ensuring women had full reproductive autonomy.  Nevertheless, Ireland ratified the convention without any reservations on these issues.  Similarly, Ireland ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child long before the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution which now explicitly recognises the rights of the child.<\/p><p> According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the requisite standard for states to be in a position to ratify human rights treaties is not that the state is compliant with all the provisions of the convention, which is a very ambitious and perhaps unattainable standard, but rather that the state&rsquo;s laws are in conformity with the object and purpose of the convention.  This approach recognises that the process of achieving full compliance with a convention&rsquo;s provisions takes time and that states can benefit from the guidance of UN treaty bodies and from dialogue with other states in order to achieve this goal.  Without ratification, states are not required to report to the UN treaty bodies for those conventions and therefore do not get feedback on their progress and neither do they have opportunities to be formally involved in conferences of states parties to a particular convention, where they might be able to share their experiences with other states and exchange examples of good practice.<\/p><p> With specific reference to the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has recommended that states considering ratification should review national legislation and policies for compliance with the convention.  The office also clarifies that any pre-ratification review should be part of a process that continues in the implementation phase to review existing and proposed legislation.  From these statements it seems clear that the expectation by the UN is that not all issues of compliance will be resolved prior to ratification but that the process of ensuring compliance is an ongoing one to carry on into the implementation phase.  The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights strongly urges states to engage in a meaningful consultation process to prepare for ratification and that those processes should involve parliaments as well as non-governmental stakeholders and in particular, in this context, the representative organisations of persons with disabilities.  The UN also recommends states should publicly launch the process of ratification, make publicly available a plan that includes timelines and opportunities for consultation, and invite civil society and organisations of persons with disabilities to make submissions presenting their views on the opportunities, implications and challenges of ratification.  To date, responses to parliamentary questions on Ireland&rsquo;s preparations to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, have been made by both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability, mental health and older people.  The Ministers in their responses have generally referred to the fact that Ireland does not ratify conventions until it is sure that it is in a position to comply.  It has also referenced the fact there are various Departments working on issues to determine whether any actions are required to address the issues in advance of ratification.  An interdepartmental committee is working on these issues.  Each Department has been identifying areas of concern prior to ratification.  In the answers to parliamentary questions provided by Ministers to date, the only key legal reform being discussed explicitly is the idea of an acting capacity legislation.  We are aware that the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will be considering the Committee Stage of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill shortly.<\/p><p> Last April the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made available some information on the work of this interdepartmental committee and identified some further areas of reform beyond the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill which, in its view, may need to be addressed prior to ratification.  Those areas include sexual offences legislation, mental health legislation and various miscellaneous amendments, including a constitutional issue around the definition of \"reasonable accommodation\" contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has committed to publishing a roadmap to ratification once all Departments with responsibility in these areas have reverted to the interdepartmental working committee with information on how they will progress actions required under their remits to enable ratification and once the Government has approved the actions to be taken.<\/p><p> In light of the lessons from Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of previous UN human rights treaties, I could make a number of suggestions for how the ratification process for the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other new conventions that might emerge from the UN can be strengthened in Ireland.  It would be crucial to strengthen the role of the Oireachtas in providing input and feedback on the proposed roadmap to ratification.  Many other countries in their processes of ratifying this convention have demonstrated how the involvement of parliamentarians in providing input and feedback on the ratification challenges has strengthened the implementation of the convention post-ratification.  It is also vital to engage in a meaningful participatory process with civil society to debate the issues for ratification.  This should include the national human rights institution which is the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and especially the representative organisations of people with disabilities.<\/p><p>A clear plan of action for eliminating remaining obstacles to ratification should be published, along with an agreed timeframe for completion of these actions.  There are many allies in the Government, Oireachtas and civil society who are more than happy to work together to find solutions to the remaining obstacles to the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there is a need for transparency and accountability to be increased to move this work forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#A01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":2663,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Flynn for her clear overview of the process.

What sorts of examples does Dr. Flynn have of practices in other countries where parliaments have done this work?  How can we assist here in this regard?  Dr. Flynn stated the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is committed to publishing a roadmap for ratification.  Should we await the publication of the roadmap before we take on hearings with civil society stakeholders, for example?  Alternatively, should we begin to engage now in advance of publication?

I suppose the best examples are from civil law countries where parliaments are usually formally involved in the ratification process because of their different legal systems.  For example, in Spain, Hungary, Croatia and many other countries, the parliament actually debated whether the convention should be ratified.  It is not a decision of the Executive in those countries but a decision of the Legislature.  That is due to the different legal systems so there is not much that can be done about that.  In New Zealand and Australia, for example, the parliaments were involved, although not formally, in making the decision on whether those countries should ratify.  Joint parliamentary committees held hearings, received submissions from people with disabilities and their representative organisations and debated the merits of speedy ratification in those two countries.  They were both in favour of ratifying quite quickly to show leadership in that area.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what could be done here, I certainly do not believe there is any disadvantage to beginning now to open discussion on these issues.  I know from dialogue with many organisations representing people with disabilities that there is increasing frustration over the fact that the process of determining the obstacles to ratification is not one into which they can be seen to have an input.  While they might have some solutions or suggestions on how we can overcome the reasonable accommodation question, there is simply no forum for them in which to present their views, apart from making submissions privately to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Justice and Equality or wherever else these issues are being debated.  However, they are not formally involved in the work of the interdepartmental committee in respect of each of the Departments that is reviewing legislation and policy under the convention.<\/p> <p>  Another step that could be taken would be to better integrate the work that is ongoing on monitoring Ireland's national disability strategy and to join that work up with that of the interdepartmental working committee on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Right now, there are two separate processes although they involve many of the same actors.  However, civil society has the opportunity to have a formal input into the disability strategy monitoring process whereas, to date, it has not had the opportunity to have a formal input into questions on whether Ireland should ratify the convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":2665,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Flynn know any more about the question of reasonable accommodation?

However, that does not really address the reasonableness criterion associated with the concept of reasonable accommodation, so in my view, it does not constitute an attack on the right to private property because one is not required to accommodate a person as one's employee in all circumstances.  Consider the circumstances of an employer who runs a very small business where an employee needs some very sophisticated type of technology or complete revamp of the office space that is not feasible.  It was never intended to apply to this.  In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the standard that had been suggested in the employment equality legislation regarding reasonable accommodation.  The definition included the criterion that one had to reasonably accommodate a person unless doing so represented a disproportionate or undue burden.  In response, when the Parliament legislated again, it came up with the much less stringent criterion whereby one had to reasonably accommodate a person with a disability unless it cost more than a nominal cost.  Most costs are higher than a nominal cost.<\/p> <p>  However, since that time, of course, the EU has legislated on this with its framework directive on employment.  The EU has reimposed the standard of the disproportionate or undue burden.  Notwithstanding the Supreme Court's decision, Ireland has changed its laws to reflect the EU position.  However, that applies only to employment, of course, and not to goods and services.  In the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the standard of reasonable accommodation is the same.  It is a matter of a disproportionate or undue burden, regardless of whether one is an employer or a provider of goods and services.  The concern is that we could have a constitutional barrier.  Does it require an amendment to the Constitution for Ireland to be able to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?  I hope it does not because that would delay the ratification process quite significantly.  Perhaps we would not be in a position to ratify at the end of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":2670,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Flynn<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#C00900","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":2671,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Flynn for her submission and for travelling to present it to us.

I do not believe anyone would have suggested that in 1986 there were no issues about discrimination against women in Ireland.  It is not that we were perfect.  With respect to human rights conventions, it is not expected that states will have reached a point where there are no issues for compliance.  There are always emerging issues that states must address.  It is more a question of a subjective value judgment as to whether we are compliant or ready to ratify a convention but for this specific convention, a very strict approach has been taken to that, which perhaps was not always the approach taken with previous conventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":2679,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Flynn for that response.

That sets off alarm bells for me, as I sure it does for people who have been active in the sector, as to what ultimately it means and what must be done to ratify the convention.  In light of what is happening in this process, one would wonder when it would come to an end.  Does Dr. Flynn understand it to be a dual process with the roadmap being one element and identifying key issues that have to be addressed being another element?  It is a twin-track process in which the committee is involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#D00600","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":2682,"content":"<p>To take the Senator's second question first, they are still identifying the areas but once they have identified all the areas and got agreement from Government that those are the areas where action is required, those areas become the roadmap.  That is my understanding of the process.  We now have more detail and the discussion about reasonable accommodation was in background for a long time but now it is explicitly named as one of the issues.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the other main issues they have identified, which are sexual offences legislation and mental health law, I would be reasonably confident about what they mean with regard to what needs to be done there.  Work has been done on this area, and the Senator produced a Private Members' Bill on the reform of sexual offences legislation.  There is a sense that our current sexual offences legislation discriminates against certain people with disabilities and that needs to be addressed.  I am speaking in regard to section 5 of the 1993 Act which makes it an offence for a person to have sexual intercourse with a person with a mental impairment.  That is an issue and consent is not a defence to that offence, as we know, which is problematic.<\/p> <p>  In terms of mental health law, the UN convention requires that disability should never be a justification for a deprivation of liberty.  For example, the fact that a person can be involuntarily detained and treated against one's will without one's consent under Ireland's Mental Health Act would be viewed, certainly by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as a problem with respect to article 14 of the convention.  That is certainly an issue and perhaps that is what it means when it states that mental health law is in need of reform.  However, those kinds of reforms take time and our experience with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill has shown how long that process had taken and it is still not concluded but it is important to get it right.  We would want to reform those areas of law.  The question is whether the issues are of such significance that they require reform now prior to ratification, or whether they are issues that could be addressed post-ratification in the implementation of the convention.  That is a judgment call and it is the Executive's role to make it but it would be valuable to inform that view with the experiences and voices of people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":2683,"content":"<p>Yes.  That is the position, as Dr. Flynn has clearly laid out.  She pointed out that the impact of the lack of ratification means we are not in a process of being monitored or supported by an international body that would examine how we are meeting our obligations under the treaty.  That is a key impact of the lack of ratification.  Dr. Flynn's response to those various issues demonstrates the importance of ultimately being much clearer and perhaps even having a policy or an overall roadmap of how we would go about ratifying conventions.  It seems the process could take for ever, depending on the judgment calls along the way.<\/p> <p>  It also strikes me, and Dr. Flynn will be aware of this, that, more generally, the rationale for the setting up of the sub-committee was to find a way to begin to have Oireachtas involvement and oversight of human rights issues, and this is a key one for us, but we are doing it within the context of the mandate of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  It further strikes me that in this regard the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is the Department that has overall responsibility for ratification but it may be useful, as we examine how to proceed and move forward on this, that if the issue concerns a treaty related to the mandate of a particular committee that it could be involved with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in that process of ratification and the roadmap.<\/p> <p>  Senator Bacik already asked about comparative jurisdictions.  It would help us to examine that in more detail in terms of how other jurisdictions that are aligned to our process have gone through ratification of treaties, even, for example, the treaty on people with disabilities.  Does Dr. Flynn have any suggestions, which she can indicate now or later, as to who we might contact to help us with that?  Could she also suggest how the committee might proceed with the issue we are discussing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#D00800","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431594000,"counter":2684,"content":"<p>To address the issue of comparative countries and how they have approached this, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights produced a report, which I cited in my opening remarks, which studied the ratification process in a number of countries that had ratified at the time.  I believe the report was published in 2009 which was quite early in the process of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but none the less at that point they were able to point to a number of different approaches.  They sent survey questions to all the countries that had ratified at that point asking them about their process, what they found beneficial and how they went about it.  In that process also many of those countries, including Australia and New Zealand, produced national interest analysis of the impact of the convention on national law and also its financial impact and the impact it might have on the lives of people with disabilities.  That is quite a good exercise and one in which the Oireachtas and this sub-committee could play a role.  The Senator's suggestion of involving the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or this sub-committee in working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in whatever process it engages in would be a valuable one and that would reflect approaches that have been taken in other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JU22015051400002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1431594000,"counter":2685,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Flynn for that.
