Judge Murphy has been asked to meet a number of key interested parties, particularly the support groups for the women, and also the State Claims Agency, and the insurers.   Together with the Judge, I met the three support groups - Survivors of Symphysiotomy, Patient Focus and Survivors of Symhysiotomy Limited - after the Government meeting on 26 November,  to outline this plan to them.    <\/p><p>  Judge Murphy will complete her work within around 8 working weeks and provide a report to me as early as possible in February. I will then be in a position to revert to Government with detailed proposals, so that a decision can be taken as early as possible on the matter. <\/p><p>  The Government has also decided not to pursue amending the Statute of Limitations Act in respect of symphysiotomy claims.  This decision is based on strong legal advice that even if the statute bar is lifted, many women will still face long delays and many legal obstacles in pursuing their cases through the courts.  A number of women have not been able to access their files and in some cases the persons involved in their surgery are deceased. Analysis of the small number of cases, which have come through the legal process, shows that the legal costs alone in pursuing a case are extremely high. <\/p><p>  The actual liability of the State in law in respect of each individual symphysiotomy case is extremely difficult to determine.   However, there is a strong cross-party commitment to facilitate closure for the women who have been adversely affected by symphysiotomy,  many of whom are now elderly.<\/p><p>  My priority continues to be to ensure that the women who have had this procedure have their health needs comprehensively and professionally met. In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who may be experiencing any adverse effects as a result of undergoing this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards for the women, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.

A review notification will indicate the card holder should complete a self-assessment or request the card holder to return evidence of household income, assessable outgoings and medical circumstances to enable a full review assessment be conducted by the HSE.  The HSE has increased this time line to four months in respect of those clients who were granted eligibility on the basis of discretion to allow an additional month to ensure that all pertinent medical and other data is provided for inclusion in the assessment process. All customers scheduled for review are notified and a balance of either full reviews or self-assessments is conducted. <\/p><p>  A reminder letter is issued a month later if the requested review form details have not been returned at that point. If a person does not return the review form within the time specified, continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and the medical card cannot be reissued. In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases.<\/p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility, in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and\/or to get back to the individuals, if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be furnished. <\/p><p>  Where a review form is returned, but not fully completed by the expiry date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out and a final decision made on the person's continuing eligibility, once there is appropriate communication from the client. Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the review of their medical card eligibility will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete. <\/p><p>  GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards\/medical cards and, subsequently, the following month and the month after that, if the patient has not returned the review form by that time.   <\/p><p>  GPs have full electronic visibility of the medical card panel of patients available to them and have the facility to electronically allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate. The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review, e.g. a blind person with little family support.  GPs can also add new babies to existing cards.  All GPs have appropriate electronic access to the medical card eligibility database and they do not have to confirm medical card details by contacting HSE PCRS.   <\/p><p>  To ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources the HSE also undertakes reviews of medical card\/GP visit card eligibility, whereby selected cardholders are asked to confirm that they are ordinarily resident in Ireland.  Being ordinarily resident in Ireland is a prerequisite for medical card\/GP visit card eligibility.  Approximately 10,000 letters are issued each month and the cardholder is asked to sign and return a Declaration of Residency to the HSE.  On receipt of this declaration, eligibility to the GMS Scheme continues.  If a person does not return the Declaration of Residency form eligibility ceases.<\/p><p>It should be noted that each person who has eligibility to a medical card\/GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &rsquo;valid to&rsquo; date is printed.

Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  The measure is projected to save the Exchequer &euro;94 m in 2014 and &euro;127 m in a full year.<\/p><p>  The new ceilings will ensure some continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase private medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  This will affect some consumers, including those over the age of 50, depending on the cost of the policies that they purchase.  While individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure, it is important that they fully understand the level of cover their policy provides.<\/p><p>  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's web-site, www.hia.ie, has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p><p>  With regard to health insurance costs generally, I  have consistently emphasised the vital need to address the rising cost of private health insurance and the necessity for all private health insurers to address their cost base aggressively.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  In June of this year, I appointed an independent Chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin, to work with my Department and the insurers on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market.

Fellowships are targeted at mid-career professionals who, on completion of the Programme, have committed to putting their acquired skills into practice for the benefit of the partner organisation and the wider community.  Fellowship awards are also aligned to priorities and thematic areas identified in Ireland&rsquo;s country strategy programmes in our key partner countries.<\/p><p>  The fellowships are awarded annually to successful candidates from key partner countries (Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia), as well as Palestine, Timor Leste and Burundi for study in Ireland or within their own country or region. From 2014, applications for Fellowships will also be accepted from candidates in Sierra Leone.  <\/p><p>Separately, Irish Aid fellowships have been awarded to successful post- graduate applicants from Vietnam under the Irish Development Experience Sharing Programme (IDEAS) and from South Africa under the Kadar Asmal Fellowship Programme.  The IDEAS programme involves sharing experience of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development with Vietnam in order to build the capacity of Vietnamese institutions engaged in economic and financial governance.  The provision of fellowships for Vietnamese post-graduate students to study in Ireland is an integral component of the programme.

When the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were being elaborated in 2000 and subsequent years, it was recognised internationally that high levels of external debt were placing a heavy burden on some of the poorest countries in the world.

We are aware of concerns expressed by the President of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) that these actions may lead to uncertainty in the political situation on the Korean peninsula.  Ireland is monitoring the situation closely through our Embassy in Seoul, which is also accredited to the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK).<\/p><p>  Ireland together with our international partners in the EU and UN have on numerous occasions  condemned the current human rights situation in the DPRK and strongly urge the Government there to immediately put an end to the human rights violations in the country. <\/p><p>  In February, my Department conveyed directly to the North Korean authorities Ireland&rsquo;s strong condemnation of their nuclear and ballistic missile testing activities, and urged North Korea to re-engage with the international community as expressed in my statement on the matter.<\/p><p>  During a visit to the DPRK in June 2013, the Deputy Head of Mission to Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Seoul raised the issues of human rights and access to the DRPK by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK and other UN treaty monitoring agencies.  <\/p><p>  In March 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in the DRPK.  The Commission has heard testimonies from victims who have suffered human rights abuses in the DPRK and will report to the UNHRC in March 2014.  It is disappointing that the DPRK will not cooperate with the Commission of inquiry.  Ireland stands by the resolutions passed by the UN Human Rights Council which calls upon the DPRK to cooperate with the UN and its human rights mechanisms.In November 2013, during the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, Ireland supported the adoption of a resolution concerning the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  This resolution highlighted the systematic, widespread and grave violations of civil, political, economic and social and cultural rights in the DPRK.  It also expressed serious concern at the absence of due process and the rule of law, including fair trial guarantees and an independent judiciary, and the use of extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions. <\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to monitor the situation closely through our Embassy in Seoul, and will remain in close contact at the EU and UN on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800067#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers Remuneration","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800067#WRC00650"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[54752\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800067#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the names and amount by which each Programme Manager\/Special Advisor in his Department has exceed the relevant pay guidelines as laid down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Revenue Commissioners attach a high priority to dealing with this criminal activity.\"  Revenue's Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)\", which is published on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie), includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products.<\/p><p>  This multifaceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, use of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.<\/p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products at importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>  In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation in this jurisdiction between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800067#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers Grant Application Numbers","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800067#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[54511\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800067#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of persons who were granted a primary certificate from 2010 to date that were receiving dialysis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am informed that the total outstanding tax debt at 31 March 2013, the latest date for which published data is available, amounted to &euro;2,006m. An aged analysis of this debt figure is included in the following table.<\/p><p>  However the &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; portion of the total debt, which excludes both debt under appeal to the Appeal Commissioners and insolvent debt was &euro;1,180m at 31 March 2013. This figure, which is a more accurate reflection of the debt available to Revenue to manage through its debt management programmes was &euro;137m or 10% less than the same period in 2012.  Of the &euro;1,180 million &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; figure at 31 March 2013, &euro;476m was under active enforcement and a further &euro;124m was the subject of phased payment arrangements.<\/p><p>  I am assured by Revenue that, notwithstanding the continuing very difficult environment, achieving further reductions in collectible debt is a key strategic objective. I am satisfied that the continuing trend in decreasing levels of &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; over the last couple of years is encouraging and clearly demonstrates the success of Revenue&rsquo;s current approach to debt management.<\/p><p><b>Age Analysis of Total Debt by Year of Assessment as at

It needs to be borne in mind in viewing these data that the level of seizures can vary significantly between years, because of factors such as the occurrence of a very large seizure in a given time period.   The incidence of illicit cigarettes in Ireland is evaluated through annual surveys of smokers undertaken for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive. The results for 2012 found that 13% of smokers had an illicit pack of cigarettes, and the comparable figure for 2011 was 15%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit products. A further survey was carried out recently, and it is expected that the results will be available in the first quarter of next year.<\/p><p>  The work of the Revenue Commissioners against the illicit trade includes a range of measure designed to identify and target those who are engaged in it, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. Key elements of Revenue&rsquo;s strategy include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, as well as the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue&rsquo;s enforcement officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private commercial premises. There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.<\/p><p>  Revenue has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These staff are deployed across a number of compliance and enforcement programmes that reflect the strategic and business priorities set out in Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy and Annual Corporate Plan. These programmes include anti-smuggling controls, audit, assurance checks, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance interventions. Resources are continuously redeployed across the programmes in response to the Commissioners&rsquo; assessment of risk. It is not possible, therefore, to disaggregate the resources deployed exclusively on tackling the smuggling and sale of illicit cigarettes. <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners assure me that combating the illegal tobacco will continue to be a high priority for them, that they are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and that they will continue to make very effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800070#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800070#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[54671\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800070#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding credit unions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>The registration and regulation of credit unions is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions within the Central Bank, who is the independent regulator for credit unions.

Section 10B of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted.

These include: the introduction of a third major transfer point for students between primary level and third level; The question of which school the Transition Year should be placed in; The undermining of Department policy to maintain as common a curriculum as possible for as long as possible to avoid the risk of specialisation too early and school drop out; The potential danger that the senior school will come to be seen as the 'specialist' Leaving Certificate centre into which transfers are sought at senior cycle; The loss of the advantages to be gained when teachers regularly teach students from first year to sixth year; The possibility of students from other schools seeking entry to the senior school with the attendant repercussions for other schools. <\/p><p>  Apart for these compelling educational reasons, patronage of the new school, was awarded to the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB) specifically on the basis that it would deliver the prescribed curriculum at both Junior and Senior Cycle. Any change to this stated intention could lead to a challenge or to calls for the patronage determination process to be commenced afresh. This could have the effects of both delaying the establishment of the new school and, of course, re-opening the patronage of the new school to other applicant patrons.  I am also satisfied that the erroneous description of the existing post-primary school in Maynooth as being a designated Community College and which was notified the New Schools Establishment Group on 24 August 2012, was corrected as soon as it came to light and that this had no bearing on the outcome of the patronage determination process for the new school.<\/p><p>  It was never the intention to provide separate junior\/senior school buildings in Maynooth.  Therefore, the cost benefit analysis which the Deputy refers to does not arise.

Given our high dependence on gas for electricity generation this would also give rise to electricity price increases and would negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.

Requests have been made to me as Minister to issue a policy direction to the CER in accordance with powers of direction provided under section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. Section 10A of the 1999 Act, as amended, does provide that I may give &ldquo;<i>general policy directions<\/i>&rdquo; from time to time.  However, I am expressly precluded from giving any policy direction in respect of any individual undertakings or persons.  Taking account of binding EU legislation as transposed into Irish law in regard to the independence of regulators and the assignment of gas regulatory functions to the CER, including tariffing, I am of the view that Section 10A of the 1999 Act does not provide an adequate legal basis for a direction sought by and for the benefit of an individual entity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800079#WRP00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers Remuneration","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800079#WRP00350"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[54747\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800079#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the names and amount by which each programme manager-special adviser in his Department has exceeded the relevant pay guidelines as laid down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.

Section 35 of the Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, contained specific provisions in respect of easements acquired by prescription, i.e. acquired on the basis of long enjoyment of the easement concerned. It originally provided that such an easement would be acquired at law only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.<\/p><p>  Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 contain amendments to the 2009 Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964 which simplify the procedures for acquiring easements based on prescription. The amendments permit the Property Registration Authority (PRA) to register such an easement without a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act where it is satisfied that there is an entitlement to it. Where the PRA is not satisfied that there is such an entitlement, such as where there is disagreement between the parties concerned, a court order under section 35 of the 2009 will continue to be required.

Details in respect of each category are as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The Civil Legal Aid Act (as amended) does not place a limit on the number of times a person may avail of civil legal aid. The granting of civil legal aid is the responsibility of the Legal Aid Board and civil legal aid is only granted in cases where the application meets the merits test as set out in the legislation.  In addition, the applicant must also be financially eligible to qualify for the service. Currently, this means that an applicant cannot have disposable income of more than &euro;18,000 per annum and disposable capital assets of more than &euro;100,000. Disposable income and capital are calculated in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Regulations. More detailed information on financial eligibility and the merits test for civil legal aid is available on the Legal Aid Board's website, .<\/p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary. The Act further provides that the court may require an applicant to complete a statement of means. It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing or, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts. There is no limit to the number of occasions a person can be granted legal aid under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.<\/p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.

As I stated in my reply, I am informed by the military authorities that risk assessments are carried out for all mission areas and suitable control measures are put in place to minimise identified risks.  Where a health risk is identified the control measures will include preventative medication where appropriate.  Where malaria has been identified as a risk, the choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues.  The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces on the basis of best international practice having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Medicines Board is the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines for use in Ireland.   The Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps complies with its guidelines on the prescription of medicines, including Lariam.  As I stated in last Wednesday&rsquo;s reply, I am advised that Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  It continues to be licensed by the Irish Medicines Board.  The Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications.  I am advised that protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.  <\/p><p>  The Defence Forces follow best international practice in prescribing Lariam.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  This is intended to rule out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions, e.g. depression, anxiety, pregnancy, neuro-degenerative disorders etc. which, as has been indicated by the Irish Medicines Board, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.  This medical risk assessment is particular to an individual, forms part of the individual&rsquo;s medical record and is not, therefore, publishable.<\/p><p>  As I stated in last Wednesday&rsquo;s response, Malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone. It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area and Lariam must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risk posed by this highly dangerous disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800083#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800083#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[54748\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800083#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the names of and amount by which each programme manager-special adviser in his Department has exceeded the relevant pay guidelines as laid down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc. This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.<\/p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, this is done by way of a Clearance of Accounts procedure. This is a formal process and both the Commission and Member States are obliged to adhere to the requirements laid down in the legislation. <\/p><p>  In the case of Ireland, the Clearance procedure is currently covering five financial years involving the 2008 to 2012 scheme-years. The total amount of EU funds under audit scrutiny in the process is approximately &euro;7.5 billion. I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s case and the position of Irish farmers is strenuously argued during the process. <\/p><p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that every effort is being made to protect the interests of all Irish farmers during the process including the interest of that majority of farmers, who were fully compliant in the declarations they made on an annual basis under the Schemes. This is an extremely serious process. During the years 2002 to 2012, the Commission imposed financial corrections amounting to almost &euro;5 billion on Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this amounted 0.5% of the total amount corrected &ndash; one of the lowest percentages among Member States. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations, the Commission has to right to impose a flat-rate correction of 2%, 5%, 10%, or greater, depending of its assessment of the risk to the EU Fund involved. A 2% correction on the 2008 &ndash; 2012 scheme years would mean a loss of &euro;150m in funding to Ireland. On the other hand, the level of the correction can be based on the assessed risk if the Member State can establish the risk and the Commission are satisfied with the calculations. In such circumstances,  if the risk is dealt with by the Member State by collecting the debts arising from the over-payments, the amounts collected is taken into account by the Commission in its final assessment. This is the approach Ireland is following.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800084#WRU01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Fleet Protection","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800084#WRU01550"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[54523\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800084#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of Northern Ireland registered vessels fishing in Republic of Ireland waters under the voisinage agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In 2011 the HSE established a National Integrated Care Advisory Group (NICAG) to review the existing Integrated Discharge Planning Code of Practice.  Following initial consultation last year with staff in hospitals and the community services the NICAG produced a draft National Integrated Care Guidance document which will replace the existing code of practice.  This document is being finalised and is expected to be published early in 2014. <\/p><p>  This Guidance Document aims to provide practical advice for service providers regarding effective discharge and transfer from hospital to the community.  It outlines the nine key steps in effective discharge and transfer of care which will facilitate faster, safer discharges for patients.  These steps include identifying whether the person has simple or complex needs, setting an expected date of discharge\/transfer within 24\/48 hours of admission and reviewing the treatment plan with the person on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  In relation to discharge summary information, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed a National Standard for Patient Discharge Summary Information as an important step towards improving the whole care pathway and enabling the delivery of safe, person-centred care.  When a patient is discharged from hospital to primary care it is essential that complete, relevant and valid information regarding the patient's stay in hospital is sent to the primary care healthcare professional in a timely manner, allowing the primary care professional to continue care and management following discharge.  The National Standard for Patient Discharge Summary Information sets out the relevant and important information that should be contained in a patient's summary discharge information.  HIQA has submitted the National Standard to me seeking my approval in accordance with Section 8 (1) (k) of the Health Act 2007.

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the body responsible for the capital project.  Last August, I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January this year.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise to the project.  In August I also announced appointments to the Children's Hospital Group Board which, as client for the project, will play a key role in ensuring the new hospital is optimally designed and completed as swiftly as possible.<\/p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission.  The new NPHDB has reviewed the design team procurement process, which had been initiated in July, and decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and taking into account changing market conditions.  While this means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the Board is confident there will be no delay to the project overall.  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced, a masterplan for the St. James's Hospital campus is being prepared and St. James's Hospital is working closely with the Development Board and the HSE in relation to the decant phase of the project.  Work on the review of urgent care centre configuration is at an advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.<\/p><p>  Planning for the number of beds for the new children's hospital was undertaken during the previous phase of this project on the Mater campus, based on ongoing analysis of paediatric hospital activity, ongoing review of Diagnostic Related Groups (clinical activity), review of existing and future service plans with each of the specialty groups and application of National CSO Population and Labour Force Projections.  This was carried out in parallel with a review of paediatric acute care trends internationally and the application of LEAN healthcare principles.  Following the Government decision to locate the hospital on the St James's campus, further analysis of existing and planned hospital activity has been carried out and the number of beds required in the new children's hospital at the St James's Hospital campus is being finalised as part of this process.  A significant proportion of the preparatory work that was done for the project on its previous site can be transferred to the new site. <\/p><p>  Work on developing a detailed timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.  However, at this stage, the Board is confident that construction can begin in Spring 2015 with the transition of services to the new hospital to commence at the end of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800092#WRCC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":716,"content":"<p>Question No. 256 answered with Question No. 33.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Data","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800092#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[54692\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800092#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which private health insurance increases have been noted in respect of the various providers; if, in the context of any study of the proportion of the market controlled by each insurer, the age profile and the extent of premium increases over the past five years, it has been determined as to which insurer has gained the greatest advantage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

For example, in 2012:<\/p><p>- VHI had market share of 56% but had 67% of the total claims paid in the market.<\/p><p>- Laya had 22% market share but had 14% of total claims paid in the market.<\/p><p>- Aviva had 17% market share and 13% of total claims paid. <\/p><p>  Given the disparities in claims costs, mostly related to age and health status, between competitors operating in the health insurance market, risk equalisation has been the mechanism used to create a level playing field in the market.  It does so by providing risk equalisation credits (based on age, gender and level of cover) in respect of insured people aged 60 years and over.  The aim is to distribute fairly some of the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health status of all their customers.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, which is scheduled to pass all stages of the Oireachtas later this week, sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the RES from 1 March 2014 and will further improve the effectiveness of the Scheme overall.  These revised credits should further level the playing field within the market, by making older clients less costly to insure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800092#WRCC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Acquired Infections","counter":721,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[54693\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which steps have been taken to eliminate MRSA or other such infections throughout the hospital service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>The prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) and colonisation\/infection of our patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AMR) such as MRSA is one of my priorities in protecting patient safety.

Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients; these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e. IV lines\/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients\/residents\/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented.<\/p><p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collates information from hospitals on healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistant organisms such as MRSA.  Information is also published on an ongoing basis for <i>S. aureus <\/i>and MRSA bloodstream infection &ndash; published quarterly to hospital level since 2007. Notably, there has been an annual decrease in reported <i>S. aureus<\/i> BSI, from 1,251 (2010) to 1,060 (2012). To the end of Q1 2013, 18.6% were due to resistant <i>S. aureus <\/i>  (MRSA), a reduction on 2012 (22.8%). I was pleased last week to launch and endorse the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus <\/i>(MRSA).  This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes\/long stay residential units and the community.  <\/p><p>  While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland which indicates a halving of MRSA since 2006,  Ireland&rsquo;s MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland. This National Guideline is a significant pro-active step in this direction and I would like to acknowledge the work of the Clinical Advisory Group on healthcare associated infections - MRSA Guideline Committee of the Royal College of Physicians Ireland in developing this guideline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments Waiting Times","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[54694\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which waiting times at accident and emergency can be reduced further by identifying those requiring more serious interventions for attention at a different location within a hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>Since my appointment as Minister for Health, I have set out to address the issues which cause delays in patients being treated in our hospitals.

The Development of Assessment and Admission Facilities by the HSE have further reduced pressure on Emergency Departments. The recent National advancement of Acute Medical Units (AMU), Medical Assessment Units (MAU), Surgical Assessment Units (SAU) and Paediatric Assessment Units (PAU) are designed to ensure rapid alternative assessment and, where necessary, admission of emergency patients.<\/p><p>  The primary function of such facilities is the immediate and early specialist management of  patients, providing a dedicated location for the rapid assessment, diagnosis and commencement of appropriate treatment.

The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary health care.  In 2012 the HSE embarked on a prioritisation exercise for Primary Care Centres. However the prioritisation process is a dynamic exercise, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.<\/p><p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop as many primary care centres as possible using one of the following:<\/p><p>  - direct build (by HSE);<\/p><p>  - by way of leasing arrangements with the private sector;<\/p><p>  - through Public Private Partnership.<\/p><p>Considerable progress has been made in the delivery of primary care centres and 34 centres have opened since March 2011.  <\/p><p><i>Direct Build &ndash; <\/i> In certain locations, the HSE will deliver primary care facilities either through refurbishment\/extension of suitable properties or through new build.  Since 2012, primary care infrastructure has been approved and is underway at 15 locations.<\/p><p><i>Operational lease <\/i> - Significant progress has been achieved under this mechanism. Construction is underway at 6 locations and planning permission has been granted at an additional 23 locations. <\/p><p><i>PPPs <\/i>- Of the 35 primary care centre locations announced under the Infrastructure Stimulus Package in July 2012, 16 locations have been identified as being suitable for the PPP model.  The 16 locations are being developed by the HSE to be brought to a preliminary design and statutory planning process. It is expected that 10-14 sites (indicative number 12 based on affordability) will be delivered as part of a single PPP contract with the remaining centres to be procured by the HSE using other procurement means. While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual  potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.<\/p><p>  In relation to the PCC infrastructure schedule for the future, there will always be more construction projects than can be funded by the Exchequer using the direct-build mechanism.  The Health Service Executive must prioritise healthcare projects including primary care infrastructure within its overall capital envelope taking into account its existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.  Future development of primary care centres will be set out in the HSE's Multi Annual Capital Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":736,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":737,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[54698\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121800093#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the next phase of the Naas hospital development plan is expected to proceed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Filling these posts represents a significant challenge given that there are shortages internationally, there is a competitive market and it can be more difficult to attract doctors to smaller hospitals.  Where sites, such as Waterford, continue to experience challenges in terms of vacancies, hospital management implement contingency plans. If necessary, hospitals make locum arrangements to ensure continued service delivery.

Intensive work is underway in all hospitals to pursue compliance with the European Working Time Directive on NCHDs&rsquo; working-hours.  The immediate focus, involving the HSE, hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs, is on eliminating shifts in excess of 24 hours.  In July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.   I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently and which will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system.  I have recently received the interim report of the Group, to be published shortly, and the final report is to be submitted to me by June 2014.
