Leinster House, Athlone and Longford-Westmeath, in particular, have lost a great ambassador.  On behalf of the Seanad, I express my sincere sympathy to all her family and friends.<\/p><p>I also extend sympathy to the family of the late Edward Haughey, who was tragically killed in a helicopter crash.  He was a highly respected Member of this House for over ten years.

She was a great friend to everybody in the House.  As a town councillor, county councillor, Senator and Deputy she exemplified how business could and should be done, in an amicable way while still at times being robust in the defence of the values she pursued and tried to promote in such a professional and exemplary manner.  We could all learn from that and follow her great example.  As you correctly said, a Chathaoirligh, she faced her illness with great courage and great leadership, in terms of the fund-raising and way she used her position to promote the importance of highlighting this terrible illness and the fact that we must do much more about it.  She faced it with great courage and dignity.  We absolutely agree with the suggestion that the House not sit tomorrow to allow all Members who wish it to mark the passing of Nicky and attend the funeral.  All Members look forward to participating in more fulsome tributes to Nicky at a later date.<\/p><p>We must oppose the Order of Business for today, given the very serious situation that has been ongoing over the last few days.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is engaged in a debate in the other House, as a third part of the Oireachtas it is important that this House also do its duty in parallel.  For that reason we call on the Taoiseach to make himself available today to come to this House and answer questions and make a statement on these matters.  In the event that he is not available due to affairs of State, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, the pioneering Minister who appears to have forced the hand of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, and presumably the Minister, Deputy Shatter, as he prepares to make a statement in the D&aacute;il, could make himself available today.  There should be no shortage of Ministers to come to the House, given that Ministers such as Deputies Noonan, Coveney and others have made themselves available on the airways, in the absence of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in recent days, and allow us to play our role on behalf of the people of Ireland in questioning and scoping out the true implications of this most ugly situation.<\/p><p>Can the Leader say how many working groups currently operate without the knowledge of the line Minister under the auspices of this Government?  That is the key question.  How many working groups operate in isolation with what appears to be full independence and plenipotentiary status without the knowledge of the line Minister?  Despite the fact that we often disagree and are divided on how to achieve the end we all seek, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has been calm and assured in carrying out his duties in the last number of years and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, whether we agree or disagree with various aspects of his work, has also been calm and assured in carrying out his duties.  It is a shame how mediocre and unprofessional they have been made to appear in the defence of the indefensible.<\/p><p>The situation is not credible.  Somebody somewhere is lying through their teeth.  Yes, everybody seemed to miss the implications of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, report last June, but are there no people in the Department who read such reports and report to the Minister of the day?  This is very important and I beg the Cathaoirleach's indulgence.  When the Garda Commissioner then consults with the Attorney General and a working group is set up, does nobody tell the Minister?  A working group has been set up to investigate what appears to be highly illegal activity, but the Minister is not told about it.  Finally, something very important that was omitted from the Taoiseach's statement yesterday, Senator O'Keeffe's contribution last night and the various contributions from Ministers and the T&aacute;naiste is the fact that the Garda Commissioner sent a letter by courier to the Secretary General of the Department specifically asking that these issues be brought to the Minister's attention.  It appears they were not.<\/p><p>This situation is incredible from beginning to end.  The reality is that heads must roll.

Like many other colleagues, I served with the former Senator, Nicky McFadden, in the last Seanad and she was an extremely collegiate individual, a very warm person and an effective Senator.  We will have time to pay tribute to her properly in the House and I look forward to that.<\/p><p>I also express sympathy to the family of the late Edward Haughey, also a former Senator.  Again, we will have the opportunity later to pay tribute to him in the House.<\/p><p>On a happier note, I join the Cathaoirleach in expressing congratulations to Mr. Colm O'Rourke, the new Head Usher.  Like Senator MacSharry, I believe we must have a debate on policing.  I do not believe we should have it today, as it is important to hear what the Minister, Deputy Shatter, says in the D&aacute;il this morning.  I am conscious that he will be making statements and that these will account for the bulk of the D&aacute;il's business today.  We should have a debate on the matter in this House as soon as possible in the next week, but we must hear a clarification from the Minister as to the sequence of events and the state of knowledge of relevant parties at different points.<\/p> <p>These very serious revelations about widespread recording of phone calls in Garda stations throughout the country since the 1980s give rise to very serious concerns about particular matters.<\/p><p>As somebody who has practised in the criminal courts, I am aware there would have been knowledge that some calls were being recorded, and everyone has knowledge about the recording of 999 calls, but what transpired in the Waterford Circuit Court case that has been spoken about and written about in the newspapers, and in another case in which a discovery order was made, is that this practice was more widespread than had been thought.  It now transpires that it was extremely widespread, and it gives rise to serious concerns, in particular about client-solicitor communications, many of which are made over the phone, privileged communications in respect of which there have been real issues in many trials, and trials in which I have been involved, where there has been concerns that garda&iacute; might have been listening in to phone calls or standing nearby when people were making them.  It now transpires that these calls may have been recorded.  That has implications for cases in which convictions have been obtained in the past and cases that may be pending.<\/p><p>I very much welcome the Government announcement that a commission of investigation will be set up to review and uncover exactly what has been going on with this widespread recording, the reason it was started, the extent to which it continued, whether client-solicitor communications were among those communications being recorded, the reason it ended suddenly in November of last year, who knew what about it, and when.  That is very important.  I welcome that the acting Commissioner, Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, will be reviewing the matter as well.  However, the commission of investigation is vital and I welcome that we have moved to that.<\/p><p>I very much welcome that at last the Government has made an announcement that a policing board will be established.

She was a remarkable, courageous and dignified woman.  I regret I will not be able to attend her funeral because I have to stay close to Dublin for hospital reasons but I know our group will attend.<\/p><p>I do not believe I have ever asked in this House for anybody's head previously but I did say two weeks ago that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and the Commissioner, would have to go, and I gave reasons.  In terms of the confidential recipient saying that if one goes against Shatter, he will screw one, he should have gone then.  That is incredible from a Minister for Justice and Equality.  In any other jurisdiction he would have been gone.  I do not take any joy in that.  I know he is a very clever, remarkable man.  It is like a Greek drama.  He has a tragic flaw of arrogance and an inability to resist the temptation to smear anybody who gets in his way.<\/p><p>In terms of events that happened on the Minister's watch, the arrest of Deputy Clare Daly was an absolute disgrace for which an apology should have been made.  The misuse of information about Deputy Mick Wallace and where he got it from was shocking.  Last night, I believe unintentionally, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, who came to his defence and threw his substantial weight behind him, hung him because what he said was that for the Minister to have to resign there would need to be a serious situation involving either incompetence or malpractice.  Can anybody today deny that this is a serious situation or that it involves both incompetence and malpractice on behalf of the Minister?  I do not delight in making these remarks.  I would much prefer to be positive but it seems to me that this situation cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p><p>I also listened to Senator O'Keeffe on the radio programme last night and I would say, particularly to Labour spokespeople, that if all they can say is that they are not happy and make routine references to processes, timelines and so on, they would be better to stay off the air.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600004#C00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1395830400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600004#C00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1395830400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>None of us is happy, but it is a question of honour, decency and standards.

The arrogance of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is replicated throughout this Government.  I point to another fact that must be noted.  The Government set up the Constitutional Convention and it was required, by resolution of this House, to respond within three months to resolutions of the convention.

It has come to my attention in recent weeks that many elderly people have been requested to pay extra money for services in nursing homes.  We are all aware there is a fair deal system in place where people on basic social welfare pay 80% of their social welfare payment per week.  That leaves elderly people in particular with a meagre &euro;40 per week for themselves.  It now seems that contracts signed in some cases a number of years ago, and also ahead of the new quality standards and regulations for nursing homes, are being revisited by people running nursing homes, and in the cases I have heard about elderly people are being asked for extra money to read the daily newspapers.  That is a scandal and it must be addressed.

She was a lady, a political flower that had not yet blossomed.  I soldiered with her on Gerry Ryan's first \"Operation Transformation\" programme.  She had much less to lose than I had.  When I heard the news initially I was deeply upset.  I found her a confident and polite person.  When she spoke in this House she meant what she said and there was no acrimony or political bias.  The likes of her are few and far between.  Her passing is a loss to Fine Gael and to her constituency, as well as, obviously, a very sad loss for her family.<\/p><p>I second the amendment proposed by Senator MacSharry.  As spokesperson for justice it would be remiss of me not to show concern over the unravelling events.  I will not repeat the issues Senators MacSharry and Norris have mentioned.  The series of events that happened in the past six or eight months and are currently unfolding puts the original 1982 GUBU into the penny ha&rsquo;penny place.  I am deeply concerned that the confidential recipient, Mr. Oliver Connolly, was pushed overboard.  In my view the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, was pushed overboard.  If I were in the position of the Attorney General, Ms Marie Whelan, or the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, I would want to be wearing a very strong lifejacket in the current climate given what is going on.<\/p><p>Yesterday the Government established a commission of inquiry on the taping of telephone conversations of solicitors, journalists and witnesses which, as Senator Bacik mentioned, is extremely serious.  I understand that the Cabinet agreed to set this up in the absence of the Attorney General, Ms Marie Whelan.  If that is the case it is of concern.<\/p><p>I have sometimes made political points here - normally that is not my style.  I have had my rows with the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  I agree with Senator Norris that his position now seems to be impossible.  It is a difficult situation for the Government.  We should reflect back on 1993 when a seemingly innocuous event with a letter brought down a Government.  A letter concerning a paedophile was not presented in time, which was a non-event in one sense.  The then T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Dick Spring, brought down that Government because of the serious nature of the matter.<\/p><p>Over the past 24 hours I have been consulted by up to a dozen rank and file garda&iacute;.  Ordinary garda&iacute; who are out there protecting our streets, have no knowledge of all this.  They are absolutely innocent as far as tape-recording is concerned and are innocent as far as whistleblowers are concerned.  Some 98% of them do decent jobs, protecting our homes, lives and property.  What is coming to me from my conversations with ordinary garda&iacute;, none above the rank of sergeant, is the deep concern and disbelief at what is happening.  There is a lack of morale, a lack of leadership and a lack of trust.  I ask the leader to convey to the Taoiseach and the rest of the Cabinet that the trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be restored urgently.<\/p><p>I wish the acting Commissioner, Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, well in new role.

The systematic recording of conversations is deeply troubling.  Any fair-minded person would expect 999 phone calls to be recorded.  However, the systematic recording of telephone conversations is deeply troubling and may have significant consequences for the judicial process.  Is it the case that telephone conversations between accused people and their solicitors have been recorded?  One would worry about the whole presumption of being innocent until proven guilty.

The best we can do is to allow the commission of investigation to complete its job and encourage all parties, including former Ministers, if necessary, to assist and co-operate with the commission.  This has the potential to be the most serious matter ever to hit our system of justice, depending on how it is handled, and the gravity and seriousness of the telephone calls recorded and the people who were listening.<\/p><p>We have heard of the abuse of the PULSE system.

Despite so many people around the world starving, we waste a colossal amount of food.  The Foodcloud campaign is to get us to reduce 1 kg of the food we waste each week.  It is aiming to get 50,000 people to sign up to this.  If that were achieved the savings would be the equivalent of 5.7 million meals.  This is a matter we should debate more regularly.

It might not be a good time to call on the Minister to initiate this independent commission of inquiry, but I am sure if he puts things into context, he will realise that the murder of Father Niall Molloy and the subsequent cover-up is far more serious than the position in which he finds himself at the moment.

They think so because he has presided over a number of debacles over the past year.  It began when he divulged information given to him by the Garda Commissioner on Deputy Mick Wallace and put it into the public domain.  When the penalty points situation occurred, there was an attempt by the Minister and the Garda Commissioner at the time to muddy the waters and to call into question the integrity of the two whistleblowers.  That was quite serious at the time.  We also had an alleged bugging of GSOC and now we hear about the recording of phone calls into and out of Garda stations.  One of those Garda stations is in Waterford, where recordings were made of calls between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the case taken by Anthony Holness.

It is very serious and has implications not just for this Minister for Justice and Equality, but for previous Governments as well.  I believe the current Minister should resign.  I do not think his position is credible.  Ordinary citizens are scandalised that the Minister still seems to be hanging in there.

I also agree with the suggestion of the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition that the House not sit tomorrow as a mark of respect and tribute to her while her funeral is taking place.<\/p><p>In respect of Senator MacSharry's proposed amendment to the Order of Business, I think Fianna F&aacute;il, given its own history and everything that has happened in this State, should exercise more caution and less haste in levelling criticism in advance.

Our duty first of all is to hear the Minster himself, and that is happening today in the other House.  I suggest that the Leader should allow for a full debate on this issue next week in this House during which we can digest what has been said by the Minister and others in the D&aacute;il today.  We know a committee of investigation has been agreed.  We know an independent policing authority is being set up, which is something both parties in the Government subscribed to as far back as the Mullingar accord in 2006.

Her legacy will remain long in the memory in this House.  By way of ensuring that legacy, I suggest the Leader encourage the Government to provide more money for motor neurone research.  There is a centre in Trinity College Dublin, and those who followed the equally painful journey of Colm Murray will be familiar with the sterling work being carried out by a professor in this area.  It is the most cruel of diseases, in that it eats from the inside, and the last sense one has is that one's brain is still active.  One is fully aware of all that happening right to the end.  It is the most cruel of diseases.  Along with Alzheimer's disease, it is the curse of this generation.  Perhaps the greatest legacy that could be left to the memory of Nicky, who worked so tirelessly for research in this area by raising funds during the later period of her illness, would be for the Government to provide funds for this research.<\/p><p>I would also like to express my deep sympathy to the family of the late former Senator and Lord Ballyedmond, Edward Haughey.

He was Northern Ireland spokesman for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party during his tenure in the House.  I served with him in this House and also on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, where he made an outstanding contribution.  After his ten year tenure in the House, he was elevated to the House of Lords, which was a unique situation.  I think he is the only Irish citizen to have served in both Houses.

Her dignity and courage were exceptional.

My comments here on 27 February, 22 May and 28 May 2013 reflect my serious concerns in regard to the politicisation of certain information which went from the Commissioner to the Minister.  The Minister saw fit, for whatever reason, to betray that trust on  &quot;Prime Time&quot; when he disclosed information he had got in confidence from the Garda Commissioner.  It had happened in the past but very infrequently.  I felt at the time, because of the nature of the information, and particularly when I learned it came from the Commissioner, that it was a matter of serious consideration for both of their positions.  Unfortunately, the Commissioner found he had to resign because of his total dismissal of the importance of whistleblowers and the valuable information they gave, but the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is also guilty of the same offence and still he is remaining in office.  I am surprised, given that Ministers have spoken openly against those comments, that he still continues in office.  It reflects badly on the Government and on Ministers in Cabinet, including Labour Party Ministers.

There are major issues arising in terms of public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the administration of justice.  Whatever the complexities about what the whistleblowers had to say and how they went about bringing information to public knowledge it is fair to say that the Government has handled this whole situation appallingly badly.  I do not believe that people should necessarily have to resign in all situations.

It is a pleasure to have his family with us in the Visitors Gallery today.<\/p><p>Jimmy served as a Member of the House between 1987 and 1989 and was also a councillor for many years, including his period as mayor of Drogheda.  He was a committed public representative who served his constituents in an exemplary and dignified manner at all times.  He was very prominent in the business and sporting lives of County Louth.  Jimmy's door was never closed and he always made himself available to those who needed him for political, business or sporting advice.  It was a trait which gained him widespread respect and admiration, irrespective party politics.  Jimmy's policy was that political opponents never became political enemies.  Along with his decency and warm friendly personality, that policy was echoed in many tributes paid to him following his death last year.  As a sportsman, businessman, politician and family man, Jimmy lived life to the full.  He is very much missed by all who knew him.<\/p><p>I express my sympathies and those of the House to Chris and Jimmy's family, his friends and all his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in the House and beyond.

The Mulroy family sat through most of the earlier proceedings during which tributes were paid to the late Deputy Nicky McFadden.  Throughout it all, there was a common theme that she was a lady and someone with no enemies.  The male counterpart in another era was Jimmy Mulroy.  I had the pleasure and honour of serving with Jimmy.  In fact, Senator Norris and I are the only two Members currently in the House who served with Jimmy during his period in office which ran from 25 April 1987, which date I remember well, to 5 July 1989.<\/p><p>  It is astonishing when one looks at the life once lived to find in Jimmy's case that he covered so many areas of activity.  He spent 30 years in Fianna F&aacute;il contesting local and county elections in 1985 and general elections thereafter.  I am grateful to Hubert Murphy who wrote a fitting tribute in the <i>Drogheda Independent<\/i>, which I would like to record.  He said that for some the enduring memory was 1989, which I remember well as we all watched what happened to our colleagues across the country in the general election that year.  Mr. Murphy wrote:<blockquote>The Dundalk town hall was packed to capacity as Jimmy and Dermot Ahern battled for the fourth and last seat behind Michael Bell, Brendan McGahon and Seamus Kirk.  They had battled two years previously when the Dundalk man edged it.  All the way through the counts it seemed Jimmy was in but cruelly Brendan McGahon's surplus gave Ahern five more than him.<\/blockquote>I acknowledge my friend and colleague Deputy Seamus Kirk who is in the Gallery.  He will remember the time vividly.  I was looking at the figures for that year.  Jimmy actually increased his vote between 1987 and 1989.  His time spent in the Seanad was very fruitful for him in a constituency context.  The five-vote difference illustrates one of the most amazing things that happens in politics.  I am sure the political pundits analysing the transfers at the time were probably saying Jimmy had it as there was no way McGahon would give Ahern anything when they were on opposite sides.  It does not work like that, particularly when it comes to third, fourth and fifth preferences when many factors come into play.  The sad reality was that all the way through the counts, Jimmy was deemed to be in but Dermot Ahern got five more votes.<\/p> <p>Despite a recount, the result did not change.  What a cruel outcome for Jimmy, having run in the 1987 election and having had the somewhat small reward of having been a Member of this House for a couple of years.  I am sure he entered the 1989 election with great confidence, and rightly so.  Cruelly, he found that the transfer system, the PR system, was to beat him in the end.  It had nothing at all to do with him or his ability.  It is just the cruel nature of the PR system.  It worked against him on that occasion.<\/p><p> Jimmy was nominated to the Seanad at the time along with other distinguished Members.  They were all distinguished Members.  It is important to refer to the fact that Jimmy came in at the same time as the late Eamon de Buitl&eacute;ar, a nationally known figure, and Mr. George Eogan, whom some might not remember.  Mr. Eogan, who still visits this House, was very much a specialist in archaeology.<\/p><p> Jimmy was mayor of the town in 2001 and 2002 and for a second time when the devastation of the events of September 2011 in New York rocked the world.  He visited New York twice in the months thereafter, including on St. Patrick's Day, bringing with him the prayers of the Boyneside.  He became chairman of Louth County Council in 2007, for the first time in his 22 years with the body.  He was the first Droghedaman to hold the honour since Mr. Frank Godfrey, a great friend of all of us who are still serving, in 1995 and 1996.  I am sure that the Mulroy family felt great pride on the election of Jimmy as chairman.  My father served for a similar amount of time on Leitrim County Council without his ever having served as chairman previously.  He would talk proudly about that period.  I am sure the same was true of Jimmy and his family.<\/p><p> Jimmy formed his own company, M&amp;amp;L Manufacturing, in 1974 to provide switchgear to the construction industry.  He was deeply involved in many aspects of Drogheda life.  He was chairman of the board of management of Drogheda Institute of Further Education and of the VEC at one stage.  He retired from his various roles in 2009.  He once said that in politics and sporting life, he never made any enemies.<\/p><p> Most people in Drogheda and elsewhere in County Louth, in addition to the wider GAA family, will remember Jimmy most for his involvement in the GAA.  As a footballer with his beloved Newtown Blues and Louth, he enjoyed exceptional success, achieving an incredible nine Louth senior football championship medals with his beloved Newfoundwell outfit.  I am not sure whether Deputy Kirk ever played against him at any stage.  If he did, I am sure he found Jimmy a very tough but fair opponent.<\/p><p> In 1963, Jimmy did something not too many Louth captains achieved, namely, lifting a cup in the winter league, the O'Byrne Cup, when the Blues made up almost half of the county side.  Jimmy wore the red of the county seniors for the first time as a 19-year-old in 1959.  He was an exceptionally talented young footballer.  He lined out until 1971, filling slots from midfield to fullback.  He got Leinster honours also, playing against Ulster in the Railway Cup final of 1964.  When his footballing days ended, he went into management.  The new role of team manager had been created in Louth and Jimmy was asked to take it on at the young age of just 32.  He managed the team for three seasons.<\/p><p> My good friend and colleague Jimmy was married to Chris for 41 years.  They remained devoted to each other until the end.  I am sure the Mulroy family would like on the record of the House the words of a poem by Kipling recited by Jimmy's son Cormac at the funeral service:<blockquote>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br \/>Or walk with Kings &mdash; nor lose the common touch,<br \/>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br \/>If all men count with you, but none too much;<br \/>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br \/>With sixty seconds&rsquo; worth of distance run,<br \/>Yours is the Earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it,<br \/>And &mdash; which is more &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be a Man, my son!<\/blockquote>Once again, I express my deepest sympathy to Chris, Caoimhe, Christine and Cormac, in addition to Jimmy&rsquo;s grandchildren, Evan and Tess, his brother Dermot, sister Helen and many other family members and friends.  He had a wide circle of friends, not least in this House.

As a fellow Louth person, I welcome Deputy Seamus Kirk to the House for these tributes.  I did not have the good fortune to know Jimmy Mulroy personally but anybody from County Louth will have grown up knowing his name and reputation.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney's lovely tribute highlights the exacting world of politics and how one can be a Member one minute and not the next.  Had Jimmy not entered politics, perhaps his life would have taken a different path.  When one reads all the tributes, one realises that wherever Jimmy Mulroy went he was most deeply respected, not only by the people in his native Drogheda but also those in Dundalk and the rest of the county.  We all know of the friendly animosity between people from Dundalk and Drogheda but everybody is unanimous in acknowledging the respect that Jimmy commanded in the county.<\/p><p>When I read some of the tributes, I noted that one councillor said Jimmy had always made sure political opponents never became his personal enemies.  That is the sign of a true gentleman, a man who knows his own mind and does not let political life, ambition or other factors take over.<\/p><p>Jimmy was one of the most respected people in Drogheda.  He played a leading role in business, politics and sport within the community.  He made an immense contribution to Drogheda and the rest of the county, bringing his business from Dublin to provide employment to people within the Drogheda area.  He dedicated his life to improving the lives of people locally and nationally.<\/p><p>I have heard it said that Jimmy was a true champion of the people.  That is a lovely tribute to anybody.  If it could be said of us all, it would be wonderful.  It is the mark of a man to call him a true champion of the people.<\/p><p>We should remember Jimmy's sporting life with Newtown Blues.

Senator Paschal Mooney pointed out Jimmy's general election battles and the very disappointing race in which he lost his seat in 1989.

I join my colleagues in extending a warm welcome to his wife, sister, children and grandchildren.  I had the pleasure of speaking to them in the anteroom.  I did not actually know who they were but when I realised it I went over and talked to them.  The spirit of Jimmy Mulroy will still be around as long as that family exists.  They have his spirit.<\/p><p>Jimmy was a thoroughly decent and honourable man.  This is an important note to strike at a time when so many of our institutions &mdash; political, cultural and religious &mdash; are in question.  We need decent people in politics.<\/p> <p>Jimmy was a thoroughly decent man, wonderfully affable and enjoyed a joke.  He loved a laugh and would have rather enjoyed banter over \"our day will come\" and \"tiocfaidh &aacute;r L&aacute;\" which we will probably hear from Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.<\/p><p>His family reminded me of a bit of banter between us and across the floor about the relationship between W.B. Yeats and Maud Gonne and what would have happened had they married.  We wondered whether their children would inherit the looks of one and the brains of the other and what combination would be appropriate.  I remember the extremely funny exchange and that was the enjoyable part.  Jimmy was able to show that one could enjoy a joke and life could be fun even when it was serious.  There was no more serious person than him yet he contributed so wonderfully in business, sport and politics.  That is a very considerable range in which to contribute to one's country.<\/p><p>I always thought of him as an entrepreneur because he was always bright-eyed and bushy tailed, he caught on to ideas and was always in motion.  I hope that it is not inappropriate for me to say so but there is another connection between the late Senator and then Deputy, Nicky McFadden, who was also a much loved Member of the House.  A parallel can be drawn between her and Jimmy because both of them were attacked by very insidious illnesses.  People think that politicians are immune to the frailty of humanity but they are not.  I cannot think of anything more cruel for Jimmy to suffer than Alzheimer's disease because he was always so alert, bright-eyed and bushy tailed.  To think of him being confused is a sad thought but he had a wonderful family to cherish and comfort him in that situation.  <\/p><p>We exchanged Christmas cards right up until the time of his death.  He was one of the people with whom I kept in contact.  It cannot be more than a couple of years ago but I am pretty old because, as Senator Mooney has said, I entered the Seanad at the same time as Jimmy.  That seems like yesterday even though it is the best part of 30 years ago.  However, some years ago I met him in the car park and discovered that he had not changed and was exactly the same.  I am glad that is my memory of him.  <\/p><p>Of course he was very proud to have been Mayor of Drogheda.  I am sure that is one of his achievements that he really appreciated.  Politics is a tough game and to lose by four or five votes is really awful.  However, he picked himself up and went on with his life which is a tribute to him.<\/p><p>It is pleasant and gratifying to see his family here in the company of his fellow Louth man, Deputy Seamus Kirk.  Jimmy will be missed by none more than his family.  I am sure that they have genuine mixed emotions.  There must be pride to hear his colleagues speak of him in this fashion and there must also be sadness that he has left us but that is the fate of all of us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600015#O00700","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395836700,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Chathaorligh, agus Ach an oiread le mo chomhghleacaithe ar fad, ba mhaith liom f&iacute;or chaoin f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh chlann Jimmy Mulroy anseo inniu.

I did not have the pleasure of knowing him as I am a younger Member of the House and am only here a couple of years.  However, it is important to hear the tributes that have been paid to him as they are a testament to the man, particularly the pictures drawn by different speakers today.  Tributes are important and I commend the Leader for arranging same.  We must take time out of our hectic schedules and from debating important matters to pay tribute.  We must give tributes their due reverence and importance and recognise the work that has been done by former Members, particularly on their passing.  On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group I wish to convey our sincerest comhbhr&oacute;n &oacute; chro&iacute; ar bh&aacute;s Jimmy.    <\/p><p>As I sat and listened to the tributes I was reminded that politics is a family game.  The general public tend to see the public figure who is out front and centre, making speeches, attending meetings, etc., but we all know the support network that operates behind all politicians.  Without family support we would be nothing.  It is very important to recognise the role played by his family and the way they supported Jimmy in doing all of his public work.  It is quite obvious from the testimony given today that he was a very honourable and decent man who did great work for his community and for the people of Drogheda.  He was also a great man on the sports field and on the political field.  His passing reminds us that it is a privilege to serve on behalf of the people whom we represent.

That is where I first met him.  As a footballer and player myself, I must acknowledge that Jimmy Mulroy never received a red, yellow or black card or warning signs because he never had his name taken on a football field for doing anything wrong.  That is true and I defy anybody to beat those statistics.  Somebody said that he made his senior championship debut in 1959 at 19 years of age.  I can attest to the fact that he was a member of one of the greatest club teams that this country every produced, the Newtown Blues from Drogheda.  I would have a few more senior medals than two if the Blues had not been around in the 1960s and 1970s but I still have great memories.<\/p><p>Somebody mentioned that he won nine senior championship medals which takes some doing.  It also takes some doing for a man to have nine senior championship medals and be on the best football team in his county.  He made his debut for Louth as a 19-year-old, played for his county for a number of years as already stated and he also played for Leinster.  I am not sure whether he captained the Leinster team but he captained the Louth county team. <\/p><p>He joined Louth County Council in the same year as I did in 1985.  I shall refer to one of my greatest memories of him.  In fairness, he told everybody I met with him the same story over the years when he would recall the incident where Brennan scored three goals on him in a league final in Seamus Kirk's home village of Knockbridge.  I am glad to see Seamus seated in the Visitors Gallery.  He is another gentleman in politics, as was the late Jimmy Mulroy.  If Jimmy mentioned the incident to me on one occasion he said it 1,000 times.  Somebody said that he never had an enemy and I can attest to that fact.  He played the game within the rules and was also astute in his reading of a game.  He was an exemplary sportsman.  I would love to see young men and women emulate his legacy on the football fields of this country. <\/p><p>We joined the council together in 1985. <\/p> <p>I was only 16 years of age then.  Jimmy was a few years older than me.  We will forget about that.  <\/p><p>He waited 22 years to chair Louth County Council.  I waited 20 years to become chairman.  I remember vividly the 1989 election and Jimmy being beaten by five votes.  One family did not turn out but that is what it was.  I think there was a recount as well.  I would not like it to go on the record but I feel that Brendan McGahan wished it went the other way on that occasion, as did I, quite honestly.  <\/p><p>He was a gentleman and a true Drogheda man.  He made a significant contribution to the business world of county Louth.  There were not many businesses which were so successful.  In his latter years, for a man who was so agile and fit, it was sad to see him suffer.  He was well looked after and I must congratulate his family, including his brother and sister, on how well he was looked after.  I have great memories of him.  I did not serve in the Seanad with him but I have heard of his contribution to the Seanad.  I extend my sympathies to Chris, Caoimhe, Cormac, Christine, his sister Helen, his brother Dermot and all his immediate friends and colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  I mean it.  He was popular all over the House and based on my experience of him in Louth County Council, he made a significant contribution.

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil muid go l&eacute;ir tagtha le ch&eacute;ile inniu chun cuimhneamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an obair a rinne s&eacute; sa Seanad agus le linn a shaol.  I welcome the family and pay tribute to Jimmy Mulroy both for his work in the Seanad and indeed for his entire life.  Senator Mooney who served with Jimmy highlighted a number of the nominees who were appointed to the Seanad with Jimmy.  I think Senator Mooney probably agrees with me that he vastly underplayed that.  The Taoiseach's nominees in 1987 were one of the most distinguished group of politicians ever appointed to this Seanad.  I will list them all.  There was a minority of party appointees, nearly all of whom were businesspeople, which shows the way Mr. Haughey was thinking at the time.  Seamus Cullimore from Wexford was a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator and a businessman.  Senator Mooney mentioned an Sheanad&oacute;ir &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ar and Professor George Eogan who is one of the most famous archaeologists in the world.  The playwright Brian Friel was appointed to the Seanad at that time.  Tom McEllistrim from Fianna F&aacute;il and the racing figure John Magnier were appointed as well.  Another appointee was the hotelier Vivian O'Callaghan from Bantry.  Dr. John O'Connell, who died recently, was appointed that year and became Minister for Health.  Nicholas O'Connor was a businessman from the Gaeltacht with Irish language connections.  Another appointee was John Robb who was one of the first people from a Protestant or Unionist background to sit in this House and emphasise the cross-Border role.<\/p><p>An exceptional group of people was appointed to the Seanad in 1987 by Mr. Haughey.  When one looks at it like that, it was a tremendous honour for Jimmy to be included in that because there was a minority of political appointments and the political appointments were, by and large, businesspeople - employers and entrepreneurs.  I suppose that was the mood at the time.  When Fianna F&aacute;il came into power in 1987, the country was obviously facing a huge crisis and the objective was to reduce the debt and to get people back to work.  It is like what is happening today.  As a ten-year-old at the time, I remember very vividly the economic difficulties faced by businesspeople.  The cultural side that Mr. Haughey was very keen on and the business and the practical side are reflected in those Seanad nominations.  It was a huge honour for Jimmy to have been among that special group of 11 people who were appointed to the Seanad at the time.<\/p><p>I also express the sympathy of my father and family.  It was done before at the time of Jimmy's passing.  My father served on Drogheda Corporation with Jimmy for 15 years and he was a very good colleague.  He was always talking about investment for Drogheda and bringing jobs to the town.  I remember as a ten or 12-year-old hearing the news on Boyneside Radio or LMFM.  I vividly remember Jimmy talking about natural gas for Drogheda and bringing factories or jobs to Drogheda.  They were just two of the things that were very important at the time.  He was a great Gaelic footballer and is remembered locally for that.  Senator Brennan very fairly and eloquently set out Jimmy's record on that.  <\/p><p>I will conclude by expressing my sympathies and thanking the family for being here and Deputy Kirk and the Seanad leadership for organising this.  I express my sympathies to Chris, Helen, Caoimhe, Christine and Cormac and the lovely grandchildren.  It is great to be here and it is wonderful that we remember this and that this is on the record of the Seanad.  That may be important for the family so that in the time to come, they can look back on this debate as well as all of Jimmy's contributions which remain on the record of the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600017#Q00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1395837300,"counter":130,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;d orm inniu c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi Jimmy Mulroy.

Jimmy was an amazing man who was full of integrity and goodwill towards others.  He was a man who could work with all politicians from all parties.  He never said a cross word to anybody but wanted the best for his town, county and country.<\/p><p>He told me one day while we were having a chat over coffee that he was so sorry for Cooley Kickhams because the Blues were beating them every time that he let Senator Brennan score three goals and a point one day.  Was he not a very decent man to do that?  He was a businessman and had a business ethic and culture.  Everything had to be judged in terms of its benefit to the community or county.  I recall he when he was in Louth County Council.  He was a very successful chairman of the council and I recall him week after week talking about a road called the Northern Cross route.  No meeting went past without him talking about this road from the M1 to the port of Drogheda.  If it is ever completed, I hope the people of Drogheda and county Louth have the wisdom and decency to name that road after Jimmy Mulroy because it will be because of him that it is on the agenda.  The best memory I have of Jimmy Mulroy is when we both went to New York in 2008 for St. Patrick's Day and marched up Fifth Avenue.  That was a fantastic occasion.  Chris was with us.  What I remember most is that Chris would go out shopping every day.<\/p> <p>Myself and Jimmy would sit having a cup of coffee and we used to have a bet with each other about how many bags Chris would bring back with her.  He was absolutely devoted to her, 100 per cent.  I am sure his loss is almost unbearable in that regard.

Haughey who had great hopes for him as a Member of this House and as a possible future Minister.  He certainly had the ability to be a Member of the D&aacute;il and a Minister.  I knew of his business involvement and the fact that he was producing a tremendous product.  He employed people and was concerned with job creation in the constituency and in County Louth.  His family can be very proud of him as a former mayor of Drogheda and chairman of Louth County Council.  He achieved a lot in those roles.  I always found him to be the most gentlemanly of men.  His contributions in the House were always significant.  His record of attendance was excellent and he took very seriously his membership of this House.  He took his job seriously, whether that was in his role as a businessman, a mayor or a husband, father and grandfather.

While I never served in the House with him we met on numerous occasions during Seanad elections and in Leinster House.  He struck me as a man who carried his responsibilities with the greatest of ease.  He was never in bad form.  He never carried a chip on his shoulder.  He was a model in that sense.  So many people carry chips on their shoulders or talk about others behind their backs but Jimmy Mulroy was none of that.  <\/p><p>He had very satisfying careers as a politician and as a footballer and manager.  He was a town councillor and a county councillor.  He was a Senator.  He ran for the D&aacute;il and was just short of the post on both occasions and was very unlucky not to have been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He was mayor of Drogheda and he was chairman of Louth County Council.  Those are great honours to be bestowed on anyone - any one of which is a great honour - but he achieved all of those.  He was a club footballer, winning nine county championships which is an extraordinary feat.  It would be difficult to find many people in the country who have won nine county championship medals.  He played county and club football for many years.  He was a successful club and county football manager.  He carried all those responsibilities with great ease and in my estimation he was a model man.  He never looked his age - he looked about 50 even though he was in his 60s.  That is a sign of how he carried his responsibilities.  It was a great honour to know Jimmy Mulroy and he is a great loss to his wife, Chris, and to his family and also to Fianna F&aacute;il and to County Louth.

There is a depression among farmers in the beef industry.  That is the best way to describe it.  The collapse in prices is pushing many people over the edge financially.  Everyone is struggling.  I know from the beef farmers whom I meet or know that they are in bad form.  In recent times, they have been attending my clinic due to social welfare issues because of the collapse in beef prices.  It is sad to see farmers in that type of humour.  We hear much about how the agricultural sector will bring us out of the depths of recession, but the bad humour that has become noticeable has touched me.<\/p><p>  Two major issues have led to the current crisis.  The Minister must get a grip on it instead of relying on the usual platitudes of the market.  The agricultural sector should not be treated the same as any other market sector.  Beef processors have changed the game, altering age and weight criteria for the bulls to be slaughtered, resulting in the price collapse.  As regards the UK market, there are difficulties with labelling, communications and the marketing of Irish and British beef, resulting in a decrease in demand.  These issues place pressure on farm incomes and threaten exports and employment in the sector.  According to the CSO figures, half of the new jobs being created are in agriculture.  They are certainly not in the beef sector.<\/p><p>  The Government has been slow in recognising the gravity of the situation and has done little to handle it.  We propose the establishment of an independent regulator with decision making powers to oversee the industry, reduce some of the powers of and domination by processors and enable all farmers to make a living producing beef for export and the domestic market.  The UK labelling issue could be addressed by our Government through increased co-operation with the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, but not much has been done.  This issue is causing a major crisis, yet when a consumer goes to a supermarket or restaurant, the price collapse is not evident.  In fact, beef has almost become a luxury product domestically.  This is not the fault of farmers.<\/p><p>  In the past 12 months, there has been a collapse in bull beef prices, with factories altering the age and weight specifications required to slaughter cattle.  Producers have been forced to accept losses of &euro;200 to &euro;300 per head.  Processors claim that adjusting the criteria in this manner is a response to the market, but the reality is that domestic demand for the Irish product is limited and we are heavily reliant on exports.  We are subject to international fluctuations.<\/p><p>  The Competition Authority must investigate the relationship between beef processors and large retail multiples in the UK.  It is about time that the Government considered this issue seriously and referred it to the authority or the European Commission, given the cross-Border dimension.  In the national interest, all Ministers can be guilty of listening to the big boys in industry while omitting the key person at the bottom of the chain.  It is imperative that the Minister listen to farmers and heed the IFA's call for an emergency summit between all stakeholders.  In our motion and as a matter of policy, we advocate for an impartial regulator with decision making powers to oversee the industry coupled with a Competition Authority or European Commission investigation into the relationship between processors and the large multiples that control much of the market.<\/p><p>  The Government has claimed that one half of all new jobs created are in the agriculture sector, but farmers cannot be left exposed to and unprotected from swings in demand.  They will simply stop, as they cannot keep sustaining such losses, and an important export industry will quickly become a drag on the economy rather than something that can help to rebuild it.  The processors must provide clear signals to farmers to allow the latter to plan ahead.  Due to fluctuations in the market, one can do well for a time, make necessary investments and so on, but such factors are beyond one's control.  They may be under the influence of the Government, but they certainly would be under the control of an independent regulator were one to exist.  Without farmers, the business model could collapse, contributing to the country being unable to progress as planned.<\/p><p>  Beef processors must be held to account by the Government for providing a fair solution to farmers, who are key to all of the Minister's targets.  I am glad that he has adopted Deputy Smith's document as part of Food Harvest 2020.  The mood among farmers is so bad that people are giving up.  It is terrible.  I know of four individuals over whom there is a depression because of this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600019#S00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1395838500,"counter":138,"content":"<p>More people are entering farming now than has been the case for 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600019#S00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395838500,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I am referring to farmers who I have met or know and who are suffering because of these issues.

While it is easy to criticise Ministers, some matters are outside their control.  As the Opposition, however, it is our duty to highlight the problems facing farmers.  To be positive, I acknowledge the Minister's work in trying to open up international markets, etc.  It is a pity that such work is impacting on those who are trying to finish cattle, particularly those in the bull beef market where there seems to be an impasse and a poor price return.<\/p><p>A key element of Food Harvest 2020 is the target of increasing beef kill from 30,000 per week to 40,000 per week.  However, this target is not being met.  It cannot be achieved overnight, but the current kill rate appears to be between 31,000 and 32,000.  Factories are telling farmers to delay the introduction of cattle by four or six weeks, placing an extra strain on farmers and creating extra costs.  As the Minister is aware, the window of opportunity for processing bull beef is between 14 and 16 months.<\/p> <p>The steer and heifer prices, which have been reasonably stable since Christmas, have fallen in the factories.  Is there anything the Minister can do at factory level to ensure consistency of prices?  At present, there is a fall back.  I know a young farmer who took part in an initiative.  He had held on to 30 bull calves, as he was in a project which was promoted by Teagasc and the IFA.  They are now 18 months old and he is having difficulty getting rid of them.  The trouble at that stage is that it is not good protocol to castrate these yearling bull calves or weanlings, so he is waiting.  As it was an initial project that he commenced, if he cannot offload these cattle promptly and quickly, he will be at a huge loss because it costs money to hold on to them each day.<\/p><p>Last year we were in the House discussing the appalling winter we had experienced and particularly the spring of 2013.  For the farming community, although the past winter has not been as severe and there is enough fodder available, it has been the wettest winter since records began.<\/p><p>I am also concerned that some factories are introducing a penalty of 20 cent per kilo on animals over 100 kg.  Winter finishers cannot endure that loss.  In Italy, R grade male animals are making the equivalent of &euro;4.24 per kg, including VAT, which is down 1.5% on last year.  It is marginal.  In France, the R grade males are basically making the same price as last year, while in Germany there is a slight decrease.  In Spain, the price is the same as last year.  It is important the Minister challenges the factories on their commitment to paying a viable cattle price to farmers.  There appears to be a monopoly in respect of the factory outlets.  They seem to be calling the shots and are not listening to farmers.  I am not sure if they are even listening to the Minister at this stage.  It is important to highlight that.<\/p><p>The Minister should bring Teagasc, Bord Bia, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, the factories and, most important, farmers around the negotiating table on this issue.  Perhaps by knocking heads together he will be able to overcome this impasse.<\/p><p>The agrifood industry is very successful and the Minister has done many positive things in that area.  This motion is not tabled to criticise the Minister for everything that has gone wrong, but there is a crisis at present with the beef cattle price.  This will have a knock-on effect down the line, whether it is on suckler cows or the price of calves, if it is not resolved.<\/p><p>There is another concern which farmers have raised with me.  An allegation has been made, and the Minister might be able to confirm if it is true or otherwise, that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine AIM - animal identification and movement - database is being used by the factories to monitor the livestock numbers on individual farms.  If that is happening, it would be a serious breach of both protocol and of the database.<\/p><p>The Minister made a positive investment of &euro;52 million per annum through the new &euro;80 per cow beef genomics scheme for sucklers.  I welcomed it previously in the House, although I am not too sure how it will operate on the ground.  There are some questions about it.  However, the fact the money is available is a positive step.  Will the Minister ensure the benefits of this investment will not be wiped out by the fact there appears to be an impasse at present with the current price of beef, the price at the factories and the difficulty for farmers in getting rid of beef cattle?<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the Minister has travelled widely, to China and other far-flung countries, in an effort to open up markets.  However, it is critical that the Minister take the bull by the horns, if he will excuse the pun, and tackle this issue head-on.  If it is left to stagnate, there will be a ripple effect apart from the problem at present.  Beef farmers and farmers who have put a great deal of money into finishing cattle are feeling the pinch.  It is extremely worrying for them.  I hope the Minister will have positive news for us in his response.  We have not raised this issue willy-nilly.  It is a concern that has been brought to us by virtually all the farming organisations and individual farmers.  It is a matter of deep concern.  Regardless of whether the Government side of the House agrees with the motion, I believe the merits and sincerity of the motion must be acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600019#S00600","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395839100,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for raising this issue.  I accept it is a genuine issue.  Some of the things said by Senator Byrne are not borne out in the marketplace, but I accept there is a significant issue that the industry must tackle, particularly with regard to bull beef.  There is an over-supply of animals that are outside the specification that is predominantly sought by retail supermarkets in the UK.  The animals are, in most cases, over 20 months.  The market is seeking smaller animals but it is very hard to produce 16 month beef in Ireland on the back of a grass-based system.  In fact, it is practically impossible to do it.  It requires a much more intensive indoor system, with intensive feeding and high protein diets, to achieve the turnaround in 16 months of an animal that is ready for the factory.<\/p><p>Bull beef of around 16 months is the system that operates in the UK, and there are some people in Ireland who do it, but predominantly the bull beef in Ireland, which is approximately 20% of the overall beef output, is on the back of a grass-based system that is supplemented by protein feeds.  As a result, farmers are producing animals which the marketplace is not looking for at present, certainly not to the extent that will give farmers the price they deserve for those animals, because they are good animals.  I have a great deal of sympathy for farmers who find themselves in that position, but it is important that we all have an understanding of what the marketplace is seeking, as opposed to trying to force the issue.<\/p><p>I will outline some more general information on the beef sector, because it is important to have it on the record.  The beef sector is a key component not only of our agrifood industry but of our economy generally.  More than 100,000 farmers are involved in keeping cattle and sheep and approximately 65,000 farmers are engaged in specialist beef farming.  Developing this sector has been a clear priority for me since taking office.<\/p><p>Food Harvest 2020 outlines a strategy for the development of Ireland's agrifood industry, including the beef sector.  It is the result of a collaborative approach to policy-making and includes a vision for the beef sector developed and agreed by stakeholders, including farm bodies and processors.  Subsequently, the beef activation group, chaired by a former Secretary General of my Department, outlined the actions needed to deliver on this vision and outlined a more ambitious target of a 40% increase in the value of beef output, up from the previous 20% in terms of targets.  That report makes a number of recommendations relating to improving supply chain relationships, the adoption of genomic technology, improving the calving rate, addressing animal health issues and other initiatives designed to deliver on the Food Harvest 2020 targets.<\/p><p>My clear focus has been and will remain on delivering on the actions necessary to allow the beef sector to deliver on the targets it set for itself in the plan.  These actions must be progressive, forward looking and market orientated, building the potential of the sector and improving productivity, profitability and environmental sustainability.  I wish to use research, innovation, knowledge transfer and investment capital to improve productivity and profitability in the sector.  Using Ireland's clean, green environment and reputation for high standards of quality and safety to build a strong point of differentiation for Irish food on international markets is also a priority.  Raising the profile of Ireland as a food island and a supplier of the highest quality beef in new and emerging markets has been a successful policy over the past three years.<\/p><p>It was never the case that the any of targets envisaged in Food Harvest 2020 would remain unchallenged by market or other developments.  However, neither is it valid to view the potential to develop the beef sector solely through the prism of current difficulties being experienced by some farmers producing particular categories of stock.<\/p> <p>Any objective assessment of the potential of the sector requires consideration of market dynamics over time, and one must also take into account what can be done to provide the kind of public infrastructure that can support the development of the sector into the future.  The beef activation group process that I have referred to allowed for a review of progress in regard to the development of the sector, and the chairman of the group is engaged in that process in terms of looking at what we can do to overcome some of the current problems.<\/p><p> Against that background it is worth focusing for a moment on the actions taken by Government to build on the vision in Food Harvest 2020 which, to its credit, was put in place by the previous Government in terms of the start of that process.  In January 2014, I announced operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40 million for beef farmers.  Among the measures in this investment are packages around a &euro;23 million beef genomics scheme, a &euro;10 million beef data transfer programme; &euro;5 million for the beef technology adoption programme, that is, discussion groups, and &euro;2 million that is still being paid related to the previous suckler cow welfare scheme.  These announcements are additional to the testing of more than 450,000 calves under the voluntary phase of the BVD programme delivered by Animal Health Ireland, the launch by Bord Bia of the Origin Green programme to develop a brand image for Ireland's food industry and a significant increase in the number of participants in the beef quality assurance programme, a trebling of the number of farmers in the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, HerdPlus programme,; the introduction of a national weight recording service by ICBF in conjunction with the beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, and the extension of the Teagasc-<i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>better farm programme to cover every county in Ireland.<\/p><p> In addition, my Department has published a draft rural development programme for 2014 to 2020 which is under discussion with the European Commission.  This will build upon the supports announced in 2014, and I am proposing a number of measures of interest to suckler farmers which include a beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year for this sector, a substantial new agri-environment-climate scheme, GLAS, which will build on the progress made under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and will provide significant increased income for up to 50,000 farmers, continued strong support for disadvantaged areas with spending of approximately &euro;195 million per year, incentives for on-farm capital investment for the beef sector as well as other sectors, and a continuation and an addition to the knowledge transfer and innovation measures that have been developed in recent years for the beef sector as well as the sheep and dairy sectors.  Suckler farmers will be able to apply for any or all of these measures over the lifetime of the programme as suits their particular enterprises.<\/p><p> I will refer briefly to market developments.  As I have mentioned, our beef exports reached &euro;2.1 billion in 2013, which is a great success story from an Irish perspective.  Since my appointment as Minister I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding international markets for dairy, beef and lamb, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish production and control systems.  My aim is to provide a platform for long-term trading relationships into the future in these sectors, particularly in new and emerging markets.<\/p><p> Since taking office, I have led trade missions to China, Japan, the United States, Algeria, the Gulf states and countries in the Middle East.  My Department engages daily with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and the Irish diplomatic service, on market access issues.  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement on imports from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran, which provide more options for exporters of Irish beef. As recently as January this year, Lebanon agreed to reopen its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats.<\/p><p> We are making very good progress in regard to the US market also.  I was in the US last year meeting the Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack.  That was a very positive engagement and I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able officially to open beef exports to the US again.  Likewise, I am making good progress with China.  We are the only country in the world that has a formal working group with China on beef access, and we will continue to push that significantly.  We have an ongoing programme in conjunction with and led by Bord Bia around the Origin Green initiative, which again raises the profile and the perceived quality of Irish food.<\/p><p> With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, which has been a major issue for farmers, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market.<\/p><p> I want to refer also to EU beef labelling rules, which require the place of birth, rearing and slaughter to be displayed on consumer packaging.  These are well-established, long-standing rules introduced to address consumer demands for transparency regarding the origin of beef.  Trade with the UK in beef born, reared and slaughtered in Ireland is strong, and I have not heard any suggestion that rules requiring such beef to be labelled as Irish are regarded as a disadvantage.  However, British retailers prefer to market Irish beef separately, that is, as either British or Irish.  That is entirely a matter of commercial preference based on their perception of consumer choice.  This purchasing strategy clearly means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country, that is, born, reared and slaughtered in the same country, and is a disadvantage for farmers rearing animals in Ireland and sending them live to the UK for fattening and-or slaughter.<\/p><p> In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, the response from British retailers has been firm and unequivocal.  Nevertheless, Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner by far when it comes to beef.<\/p><p> In regard to the current difficulties between farmers and processors, the Senators will appreciate that, ultimately, questions of price and market specification are matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle and it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly on pricing issues. None the less, I recently met farmer representatives and processors to discuss the current situation.  Following that interaction, I have called on factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, to engage to resolve various issues that have lately caused difficulties for many producers.<\/p><p> At my request, Meat Industry Ireland member companies have kept their livestock offices open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  Meat Industry Ireland member companies have made available contact details for each of their main plants to enable farmers to contact them directly.  I want to make it clear, however, that the days of market intervention are gone.  My focus is on developing the potential of the beef industry, and expectations that any Minister with responsibility for agriculture can intervene on price are misplaced.  I would not be allowed to do it anyway, even if I wanted to.  None the less, the relationship between processors and farmers is a very important one, and obviously I have a role to play in that relationship.  Ultimately, both sides must work together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market to ensure the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers.<\/p><p> The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain and to address supply chain issues in such a context.  An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector, and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.<\/p><p> It is important also to acknowledge market evolution in recent years.<\/p> <p>In 2013, the performance of the beef sector in 2013 was strong, with output of over 518,000 tonnes, which was an increase of 5% over 2012.  The value of beef exports increased by 10% in the same year.  Irish beef prices were 106% of the EU average in 2013 and notwithstanding recent fluctuations remain, on average, relatively strong.  The average price change in the first ten weeks of this year is a reduction of approximately 1.8%, which Opposition Senators have described as a market collapse, which is simply not accurate.  It must be remembered that this is a common price across many sectors.  I acknowledge that we have a fundamental problem in the bull beef market.  However, beef across other sectors has seen a slight price reduction, but not a price collapse.  That slight price reduction is reflected in other markets across the European Union.  There is a specific issue with the price differential between Ireland and the UK and I have explained why that is the case.<\/p><p>I note also that slaughtering of bull beef in the first 11 weeks of 2014 up to the week ending 16 March stood at almost 65,000 head which represented an increased kill of almost 2,000 animals, 3%, over the same period in 2013.  The idea that bull animals are not being killed is also not true.  While farmers are not getting the price they want for them, approximately 6,000 bulls a week are being slaughtered.  I have an assurance that the factories will continue to slaughter bull beef while we deal with the oversupply issues.<\/p><p>In addition, the number of live cattle exported to the end of the week ending 9 March is approximately 42,000 head, an increase of 6% over the same period last year.  Farmers have been calling on me to increase live cattle exports to give farmers an option other than selling to the factories because they are not getting a good enough price as they see it from the factories, and we are delivering on that.  We have seen live cattle exports increase again this year.  Last week, 2,500 bulls were sent to Libya, again trying to deal with the bull beef issue.  While undoubtedly there were problems in January when bull beef slaughterings were down 25% on last year, it appears that there has been some progress since then, and currently bull slaughterings are up 3% on the same time last year.<\/p><p>I restate my strong commitment to the development of the beef sector in line with the vision outlined in Food Harvest 2020.  It is important to acknowledge the difficulties for some operators, particularly in the early part of this year as well as the vulnerabilities in the sector.  Ultimately, the future of the sector will depend on recognition by operators along the supply chain of their mutual interdependence.  Clear and early communication of market and specification requirements must be matched by an engagement from primary producers on these issues, but equally there must be recognition that the primary production sector inevitably has a lag between market signals and production response.  There are no simple solutions but positive engagement is essential to begin to solve these problems.<\/p><p>In plain English we need to ensure there is an ongoing conversation between farmers, the primary producers of quality product, and the processors who have to find a market for all this product.  It must be remembered that we need to export and find a consumer in a market outside Ireland for nearly 90% of our beef.  As we face intense competition in many of those markets, we need a processing sector that is active and successful in doing that on the back of the reputation of the Irish beef industry.  Farmers need to understand the specifications those markets want.  At the moment those markets are steers and heifers, and not bull beef even though it may suit many farmers because of their production facilities to produce bull beef.  If farmers are to produce bull beef they need to have an early conversation with factories as to the specification the market requires so that when they deliver them they get the price they expect, as opposed to turning up in the factory with an animal that is 23 or 24 months old and does not meet the specification.<\/p><p>This is not a blame issue and we need to work together.  There is a role for me and my Department in ensuring there are a relationship and understanding between farmers and processors so that the market gets what it wants from Ireland and farmers get what they deserve they get in terms of the best prices in Europe because we produce the best beef in Europe, but we need to be producing the best beef to a specification that the market requires.<\/p><p>I obviously cannot support the motion.  I do not accept that there has been a collapse in beef prices over the past month.  I accept there is a particular problem with bull beef that we are trying to address and will continue to work to try to address through live cattle exports, through working with factories to ensure we get the numbers through, and through working with farmers to try to learn lessons in terms of specifications, etc.  I do not agree that processors are refusing to slaughter bulls given that approximately 6,000 bulls a week are being slaughtered.  I accept that farmers are not getting the prices that they want, and deserve, having produced very good quality beef.  However, there is a genuine market problem with that and we need to learn that lesson.<\/p><p>There is a series of other issues regarding labelling and so on that I simply cannot support.  I accept the thrust of the motion that the Opposition wants me, as Minister with political responsibility for this sector, to do everything I can to assist an element within the beef sector - the bull beef sector - that is really feeling the pinch at the moment.  I am trying to do everything I can within reason to help those farmers whose income is affected by a marketplace that is not rewarding them for producing the animals they have on farm ready for sale at the moment.<\/p><p>I believe having a beef regulator would send out a terrible signal internationally.  If I were to announce that I had so little faith in the beef sector in Ireland that I had to introduce an independent regulator because of some kind of perceived monopolistic situation in the beef sector, it would do enormous damage to the reputation of our industry.  It is totally unwarranted and unneeded.  We have a great reputation at the moment.<\/p><p>Last year, the price of Irish beef was at 106% of the European average.  That means consumers are willing to pay a premium for Irish beef.  Five or ten years ago - perhaps even more recently - the average price of Irish beef would certainly have been less than 95% of the EU average; in other words, we were not in the premium category.  We have worked hard to get into that category.<\/p><p>We have specific issues we need to address with the UK market and UK retailers.  However, the reputation and quality of Irish beef is better than they have ever been.  We need to continue on that road rather than second-guessing ourselves by putting in place an independent regulator.<\/p><p>If anybody has any evidence to suggest that cartels are operating in this industry, I want to hear about it and I will act on it.  We will send that information to the Competition Authority and it will act on it.  Companies such as Kepak, Dawn Meats and ABP operate in a very competitive world with each other and against each other in markets throughout Europe and the world.  I encourage anybody with evidence to the contrary to send it on to me and we will act on it.  Let us not act on the basis of assumptions because it is popular to kick the factories or whatever.<\/p><p>The industry here is interdependent.  Without processing, factories and meat companies, farmers would have no outlet for food they are producing, 90% of which needs to be exported.  Without farmers and quality primary producers of beef those companies have no future either.  There is an interdependence here where everybody, if one likes, needs to get their pound of flesh in terms of acceptable and reasonable margins.  To do that we need to be producing what the market wants and we need to maintain and increase the reputation of the Irish beef sector, which is what I am trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600020#T00200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395840300,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:<blockquote><blockquote>&ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ndash;<br \/>acknowledges:<blockquote><blockquote>- the importance of the beef sector to Irish agriculture;<br \/>- the ambitious development strategy for the sector set out in Food Harvest 2020 and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the full implementation of the strategy;<br \/>- the Government&rsquo;s drive to place innovation and technology adoption at the heart of the growth strategy for the sector;<br \/>- the Government&rsquo;s &euro;40 million investment package for the suckler sector at farm level as part of the 2014 budget and the further supports proposed for the beef sector in the draft rural development programme, 2015-2020;<br \/>- the excellent export performance by the sector in 2013;<br \/>- the significant efforts by Bord Bia and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enhance the reputation of Irish beef internationally as a premium high-value product; and<br \/>- the opening of new markets for Irish beef in 2013 including Iran, UAE and Japan and ongoing intensive efforts to gain access to China, US, Canada and Korea;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>recognises:<blockquote><blockquote>- the importance of clear and timely communication between beef processors and producers in relation to market specification; and<br \/>- the importance of having alternative markets for Irish beef and live animals;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>notes:<blockquote><blockquote>- the requirement of EU labelling regulations to include country of origin labelling specifications for beef;<br \/>- that slaughtering of bull beef in the first 11 weeks of 2014 stood at almost 65,000 head &ndash; an increased kill of almost 3% over the same period in 2013;<br \/>- the number of live cattle exported to the end of the first ten weeks this year is up 6% over the same period in 2013;<br \/>- beef prices in 2013 were 106% of the EU average-prices for 2013;<br \/>- the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine recently met with both farming organisations and representatives of the meat industry to encourage both sides to find an acceptable situation to the oversupply of beef product and product specification issues; and<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>calls for:<blockquote><blockquote>- a renewed effort by all sides in the beef sector to work together to continue the development of the sector;<br \/>- agrifood industry stakeholders to reaffirm their commitment to meeting the targets for the beef sector in Food Harvest 2020.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking the time to debate this important issue.  The beef industry has long played a major part in our agrifood production sector.  The quality of our beef is renowned worldwide.  There has been a drop in beef prices in recent months largely caused by the refusal of processors to slaughter bulls.<\/p> <p>Given the drop in the market, it can be said that the Government has not failed to act on the issue or address the concerns of farmers across the country.<\/p><p>Let us first highlight the importance of the beef industry to the country.  Specialised beef production is a dominant type of farming in Ireland, with 56% of Irish farmers engaged in beef production.  The value of Irish food and drink exports reached &euro;10 billion in 2013 and beef accounted for &euro;2.1 billion of this, representing 10% of the increase in value compared with previous years.  Following a 5% rise in output and a similar increase in price since 2007, steer prices as a percentage of the European average have risen from 92% to 99% to date in 2014. In 2013, the Irish price was equivalent to 104% of the EU average price.  On average, finished cattle prices recorded a 5.5% increase in 2013.  While all of this is very positive, it does not serve to detract from the situation in which we now find ourselves.<\/p><p>In order to understand the current situation, it is important to look at the mitigating market factors.  In recent times, beef production across Europe has declined consecutively each year.  The volume produced by the EU is estimated to have fallen by 2.2% in 2013, which followed a 4.8% drop in 2012.  As a result, the Irish steer price exceeded the equivalent young bull price in France, Germany, Spain and Italy for the majority of the year.  In contrast, the UK price for beef has effectively become the highest price beef market in the EU.  The UK market accounted for 53% of Irish beef exports in 2013.  This was mainly purchased by large supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda.  These retail purchasers have very strict specifications on the beef which they purchase.  Typically, they seek steers or heifers of less than 30 months of age, or alternatively, young bulls of less than 16 months.<\/p><p>As well as finished cattle, we also export an important amount of live cattle each year.  Cattle exports increased by more than 30% in 2013, with an overall value of &euro;157 million.  Major factors for this increase were that Irish calf prices became more competitive than previous years, and exports to Libya commenced for the first time since 1996.  So far this year, live exports have increased by a further 7%.  Weekly shipments go to the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain.  However, we also export live animals to the UK.  Exports to Northern Ireland declined by 13% in 2013, while just over 11,000 Irish cattle were exported to Britain.  The practical reason for this significant decline is that it is no longer viable to export live cattle to the UK for the large retail markets.  These purchasers want beef that is deemed British, which means born, reared and slaughtered in the UK, or Irish, which means born, reared and slaughtered in the Republic of Ireland, rather than beef cattle from Ireland that were reared in Ireland and slaughtered in the UK.  We should be trying to slaughter as many animals here as possible to keep with our own processors.  It is clear from this that there are floundering continental markets in young steers, while the prosperous UK market is seeking bull beef under 16 months.<\/p><p>The Government is trying to work with processors to increase the number of animals slaughtered here.  Currently, up to 600 bulls are slaughtered weekly in Ireland, and we face problems while the market is not currently seeking bulls over 20 months.  The market demands bulls that are less than 16 months, and when the bulls cross that age, we have a difficulty.  The Government is supporting the bull beef industry in acting on farmers' concerns.  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy sets out a vision for the future development of the beef sector that was agreed by stakeholders, including farm bodies and processors.  The original target of the beef sector was to increase the value of exports by 20% by 2020.  This target is achievable, depending on increased communication, collaboration and consolidation across the supply chain.  Food Harvest 2020 initiatives have had a positive impact on the beef sector.  These initiatives include the targeting of more than 450,000 calves under the voluntary phase of the BVD programme and the increase in the number of advisers dedicated to beef in Teagasc.<\/p><p>The Government has also invested largely in the beef sector.  The Minister recently announced an investment package worth up to &euro;40 million to beef farmers in 2014.  This includes investment in areas such as genomics.  This will transform cattle breeding.  The rural development programme will be a key factor in maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of the Irish food sector.  Much effort has been made by the Government to enhance the international reputation of Irish beef.  Since his appointment, the Minister has been very successful in developing and enhancing the trading links of this country.  We have once again started exporting to Libya.  The US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union.  The Minister is hopeful that the BSE ban in China will be lifted soon.<\/p><p>It is important to note that ultimately, the market price is determined by the sellers, purchasers and processors.  While the Government is in constant communication with all members of these sectors, we cannot directly interfere with the function of the market.  The average beef price change this year so far is a 1.8% reduction.  We have an oversupply of a product at the moment, namely, bull beef over 16 months.  Market demand for this product has collapsed and we need to learn more from the market in looking for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600022#V00200","speaker":"1124","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395840900,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I am sorry I missed the first part of the Minister's speech.  I was taken by this motion and given that I have strong links to this industry, I spoke to a few farmers and buyers.  On checking the recommendation of the motion that a new beef regulator would be set up, it was felt that this was completely unworkable from the point of view of both farmers and buyers.  The fundamental point is in the following question.  How can one tell a supermarket or a factory how much they should pay for meat?  That constitutes interference in the market.  Ultimately it is up to farmers to say what they will sell for.  That is dependent on farmers to hold a line unless they get X amount per kilo.  We know from experience that this never happens and someone always breaks.  The only thing that has ever worked is scarcity, and the Minister has largely said this.  For example, at the moment hoggets are very scarce and now their prices are at an all time high.  The other thing that will create a need is when the Minister is out there creating new markets, which I understand he constantly working on.  The bottom line, unfortunately, is that there is no such thing as a social conscience between factories, supermarkets and farmers.  It is business.<\/p><p>I agree with the Minister that this relationship is important.  It is an inter-dependent relationship.  We do not wish to see farmers boycotting a certain factory because that factory is always offering prices that are too low.   The point ultimately came across that the farmer is always the fall guy.  This is probably the bit that is tough.  How do we ensure that the farmer is getting an adequate price?  The farmer puts in all the effort.  The farmer takes care of the animal over the years, including the birthing process, the rearing process and so on.  Therefore, it is not fundamentally right that the farmer is always the fall guy.<\/p><p>Even the co-operatives, which were set up in the 1970s with the farmer or producer in mind, have failed the farmer as well.  They are now more interested in their shareholders.  Many of these co-operatives have gone on to be big and great, like Glanbia, Dairygold and Kerry Group, whereas they were originally about suppliers.  The point was made to me that we could look at a model of new co-operatives that would have the ethos of the producer in mind, and I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.<\/p> <p> As the Minister said, where there are concerns about price fixing, that has to be resisted.  I do not think we have proof of that even though I have heard it discussed in the Chamber recently.  There is no doubt that the factories and the supermarkets have the upper hand.  Many people have spoken about the crisis in the bull beef sector.  Information has come to me to the effect that many farmers got caught up in this because there was a promise in regard to need by factories but then the supermarkets changed their specifications and as a result farmers have been let down.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister to think about the following proposal, although it is probably one that would suit him.  I was asked why farmers do not make better use of the single farm payment by keeping the minimum stocking density to qualify for payments and thus create scarcity.  If they were to do that, the flip side is that it would affect production which is ultimately what farmers are there for and it would affect our targets for Food Harvest 2020.  We must find ways to strengthen the farmers' hand and obviously new markets would do that.  <\/p><p>I support the general thrust of what the Minister has said about positive engagement, ongoing relationships and the farmer being aware of where there is a niche but it is not always easy to predict that.  As I have said, there is a great demand at present for hoggets but not everyone could know that in advance.  If the Minister is responding I would be keen to hear his replies.<\/p><p>Another suggestion for improvement that was made to me by a farmer was that if there were more controls and checks on the weighing system, it would lead to greater fairness in prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600023#W00200","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395841500,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I accept his views in regard to a regulator and appreciate that would not send the right signals at a time when much work has been done by many, not least the Minister, in respect of the beef industry.  I am aware that his main concern is that we protect and continue to grow the beef industry in Ireland.  The number of retail customers for Irish beef now as against 2001 has grown considerably, due to hard work by many people, particularly farmers who have risen to the opportunity.  All of us are here today because of the concerns expressed by farmers in the recent past.  I am not a farmer and rather than me expressing my concerns I shall draw attention to a couple of remarks which, perhaps, the Minister would clarify.  I am aware the Minister has invested a great deal and I am aware of the additional benefit to the economy from the beef industry.  I understand and appreciate the genetic advances that are being made.  I note the beef activation group has been working hard and that more ambitious growth in the sector is planned up to 2020.  I know those things because the Minister has been busy on that front and he has come to the House frequently and told us about them.<\/p><p>  Let us have a look at a couple of the observations made on behalf of those farmers organisations whom the Minister met in February.  They also appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They met the Minister on Thursday, 20 February and four days later the factories reduced the price for steers, heifers, bulls and cows.  On the issue of the cartel across the industry, people have telephoned me to say there is a cartel.  I take what the Minister has said here that, if there is evidence of a cartel, it should be brought to his office and he will deal with it.  I would have thought that if there was evidence the farming organisations are the ones who would bring it to his attention.  I can only assume, therefore, that they did not bring such evidence to him and in that case we should put aside any conversation about cartels.  The farming organisations are nothing if not organised or in touch with their farmers.  They have all come forward and expressed their grave concerns about what is happening.  I assume they had that opportunity on 20 February to raise that matter and if they did not do it, I do not understand what is going on because people like me are being told that there is evidence of cartels.  I have not gone out and consulted with the factories but there appears to be a gap between what is being said and the information that I assume was brought to the Minister at that meeting and, perhaps, at other meetings.<\/p><p>  Farmers have raised other issues.  They say they are concerned that factories are being allowed to use the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's animal identification and movement, AIM, system database to monitor livestock numbers for individual farmers.  They asked for a guarantee from the Minister's office that AIM is absolutely confidential and that factories do not have access to those herd profiles.  They asked also that the Minister strongly defend the beef sector in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and Mercosur trade negotiations with the US and Brazil.  As that is on the Minister's agenda, perhaps he would mention it in his response.  They speak about the average price of bull beef being down 21% since last September.  I took from the Minister's observations that he is trying to encourage farmers, if I understood him correctly, to be more specific and to plan more.  Gone are the days when it was a bit of a<i> laissez-faire <\/i>at the factory gate and one could come with whatever one had and take whatever one got.  If people are to specialise in bull beef, they cannot blame the free market if they are let down.  <\/p><p>  Organisations such as the ICMSA say that farmers are sick of uncertainty and talk about people getting out of beef.  They talk about the substantial loss of hundreds of euro per animal and having to feed animals they can neither sell nor kill and they do not know what to do with them.  We have seen a litany of observations about what is going on that suggest a real crisis.  I wonder whether that is being inflated to some extent.  While there are farmers who are seriously losing, is it down to the fact that we need better planning and better specification in the beef bull area?  What did the Minister say to the meat industry representatives and to the farming organisations when he met them?  Is he satisfied that a cartel is not at work in this area?  Can he put up his hand and say that so that everybody might understand?  What is at the heart of the matter is that people believe the farmers are ultimately being let down, despite their own enthusiasm and investment in Food Harvest 2020.  At this moment they feel they are being fought against by the meat industry.  <\/p><p>  I accept that much hard work has been done.  I note that Irish beef is highly valued and is important in the economy and in the export trade.  I am aware the Minister has worked hard to contribute to that.  I would appreciate clarity on the issue I have raised.  I have had several telephone calls about Polish meat being imported and relabelled as Irish meat and being sent out as Irish meat.  As this is not the first time I have raised that matter, perhaps the Minister would comment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600024#X00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841500,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus gabhaim leithsc&eacute;al as gan a bheith anseo agus &eacute; ag caint.

Certainly a statement on that issue would be useful because there has been a sense that a cartel type arrangement could be in place between the factories dealing with beef processing.

The message, which some farm organisations have been putting out for some time, is that the beef processors are too powerful.  The latest crisis brings this into sharp focus.  An independent regulator with real power to impose a code of practice and with real workable powers of investigation is urgently needed.<\/p><p>The beef industry has become anti-competitive as the beef processors are allowed to call the shots, change their specifications at will and penalise farmers, right, left and centre and so keep prices unsustainably low.  Where is the legislation and regulation to control this practice?  There are all sorts of regulations in other industries to prevent anti-competitive conduct but there is little to prevent a monopoly or cartel in the beef industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600024#X00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395842100,"counter":152,"content":"<p>That is the function of the Competition Authority.

What was the point of all of this if they cannot now get their bulls killed?<\/p><p>The Government needs to take action.  The Minister has claimed that our Food Harvest 2020 targets will be met.  However, farmers will not continue to expand production from now until 2020 if they are going to have to do so at a loss.  Farmers are using their single farm payments to subsidise their production this year but will not be anxious to do so again.  Perhaps the factories will change their attitudes when supply begins to shrink because farmers have decided they will not remain in the beef industry when they are operating at a loss, are not treated with respect and have no guarantee of what is coming down the road for them.<\/p><p>As regards labelling of beef, Sinn F&eacute;in in the South and the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, Michelle O'Neill, is in favour of Irish beef North and South being labelled Irish beef and encourages the Minister to work towards this end in co-operation with the British and Northern Ireland Ministries.

It is unfortunate that bull beef prices are low.  I have marched with the farmers who have protested about this.  I am an active beef producer and as such know what I am talking about in the context of beef prices.  The problem is the change in the specification in relation to bull beef.  We need to focus on who controls the specification, namely, the multiples and the factories.  Currently, there are three key players in the beef industry in this country killing cattle.  These three major multiples are controlling the market.  An Irish factory controls the market, in particular the offal market, in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This is where our focus needs to be.  There are suspicions in relation to the operation of a cartel in this area.  The Minister cannot micro-manage that.  It is a matter for the Competition Authority to address this issue.  That is by whom this matter will, it is hoped, be solved.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been the most proactive of any Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of agriculture.  Currently, beef exports are worth &euro;10 billion.  This is because the Minister has promoted beef and secured new markets.  The previous Government promoted construction.  Agriculture has always been important for this country and is, in the opinion of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the future of the country.  As stated, he has invested &euro;52 million in suckler herds in terms of genomics and discussions groups.  He is encouraging young farmers, through the Common Agricultural Policy and the 25% top-ups, to get involved in the industry.  Young people are our future.  If this matter is not addressed, farmers will not be able to remain involved in the beef industry.<\/p><p>During a meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we heard a fantastic presentation from Professor Gerry Boyle of Teagasc.  As stated by him in his presentation: &quot;At present, 16 month beef is not viable in this country because we are a grass-based system.&quot;  Our niche markets are grass-based, quality assured and require traceability.  It is not economically possible to produce 16 month beef in this country at the prices currently being paid.  According to data from Teagasc, a farmer who produces 16 month old beef would at current prices lose &euro;362 per head.  People will not produce that beef if it is not viable to do so.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that people have been misled.  I attended many of the meetings at which the factories were encouraging people to produce bull beef because there was a future in it.  The specification was then suddenly changed by the factories and the multiples in the UK and they wanted 16 month old beef.  I produced bull beef for three years.  Luckily enough, I am not producing it this year.  I decided not to do so this year because I found it hard last year to get rid of the animals following the change in the specification from 24 months to 20 months and then 18 months.  It is now down to 16 months.<\/p><p>Professor Boyle also set out at the committee meeting yesterday the advice of Teagasc in regard to bull beef production, as set out at a Teagasc seminar held in Kilkenny in 2013 and attended by the Minister.  Many farmers have adopted an 18 to 20 month finishing system for bulls.  However, this system is coming under increasing pressure, with some factories no longer accepting bulls over 16 months.  That information was put in the public domain in November 2013.  Unfortunately, farmers did not heed the advice.  However, I support farmers because I am aware of the pressure they are under in this regard.<\/p><p>As I stated earlier, we export 80% of our agricultural products.  Some 53% of our beef goes to the England.  That is where our problem arises in terms of the supermarkets' control.  I will give an example.  The labelling for Irish and British beef is similar, with one label displaying a Union Jack and the other simply stating that the beef is Irish.  The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, said two weeks ago when it appeared before the committee that cuts of Irish and British beef on the supermarket shelf in Britain are priced the same, even though Irish beef is being discounted when exported to the UK.  This relates to a live Irish animal exported to and killed in a UK factory.  Sinn F&eacute;in needs to engage with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, Michelle O'Neill, in relation to what is happening.  Northern Ireland has always been a great market for the South, in particular the west of Ireland where Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh lives, with many travelling South to buy weanlings and bring them back to Northern Ireland to fatten.  Specifications are now being laid down in regard to the movement of animals.  In other words, to be quality assured an animal must be 70 days old and an animal with an Irish passport-blue card is being discounted in Northern Ireland factories.  The Senator needs to speak to the Minister, Michelle O'Neill, about that matter.<\/p><p>The Minister has been doing great work in terms of opening up new markets, including in Libya, Japan and the USA.  These markets must be pursued but the Minister needs the support of An Bord Bia and the factories to do so.  If the Minister secures agreement in relation to the opening up of a market, this must be followed up by the factories and so on.  The Minister cannot dictate whether 10,000 or 50,000 tonnes of beef should be purchased.  This must be done by the factories.  The only other avenue open to us in this regard is live exports.  If the factories in this country are not prepared to pay a fair price and continue to give the wrong advice to farmers in relation to bull beef, live exports is not the answer.  There has always been live export of cattle from Waterford and so on.  Stena Line has consistently refused to carry livestock on the routes from Rosslare to Fishguard and from Dublin to Holyhead.  This is one area in which the Minister could intervene.  P&amp;amp;O sold its business to Celtic Link, which had a larger ship that could cater for 20 units of live cattle exports on three sailings per week.<\/p> <p>Celtic Link Ferries was subsequently sold to Stena Line, which refuses to carry livestock via the shortest route out of Holyhead.  The Rosslare route has been reopened but it costs &euro;900 to bring a 16 ft. truck to Fishguard, whereas the cost of bringing cattle through Larne is &euro;350.  That is a difference of &euro;550 on two routes operated by the same company.  Moreover, having to go through Larne means animals are on a truck for an additional ten hours as they are transited to their destination elsewhere in Britain.<\/p><p>A problem underlying all of this is that Irish regulations in regard to the export of livestock are the most stringent in the EU.  This is an issue the Minister must review.  Some companies are refusing to send ships here because the regulations are so strict.  Senator Healy Eames observed that following depressed prices for sheep in recent months, suddenly there is a scarcity and sheepmeat is now being sold at record prices.  It is all about supply and demand.  We must have people being proactive and working together - farmers, factories, retailers and the Minister.  Traceability and quality is where our future lies and is what will allow the Minister to say with confidence that we have the finest beef in the world.  We must work together to achieve that.  The Opposition should refrain from bringing opportunistic motions before the House to try to embarrass the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600025#Y00600","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395842700,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Members opposite are doing a good job of that themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600026#Z00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1395842700,"counter":159,"content":"<p>It is not achieving anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600026#Z00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1395842700,"counter":160,"content":"<p>With regard to Senator O'Neill's concluding comment, we do not need to give him and his colleagues any assistance when it comes to embarrassing the Government.

His involvement in the industry gives him a level of knowledge and expertise which makes his views worthy of attention.  This issue is far too serious for party politics.  Prior to Senator O'Neill's contribution, the debate was reasoned, measured and constructive.  While we might not agree with the Minister on everything, the intent of everybody here is to seek to address what is undoubtedly a serious problem for a significant number of farmers.<\/p><p>  The question of who controls the specification is at the nub of this matter and there has been a continuing issue with the multiples in this regard.  It is an area that deserves some focus to see how it can be addressed.  I accept that the market must be respected, but it has to be done in a way that also respects all stakeholders.  Producers are a very important element of that.  The Minister indicated that the number of farmers involved directly in the bull beef sector is 65,000, with many others involved in livestock generally.  That is a very significant number of people.  If an industry employing those numbers had a serious issue, we would be concentrating on it very significantly.  That is the level of engagement I urge in this instance.<\/p><p>  There are two aspects to the motion that is before us today.  What we note and what we condemn are not really the most significant parts.  The two main elements are the actions we call for to address these issues.  One of these is co-operation with the British authorities and the Northern Ireland Executive to overcome the labelling restrictions that are acting as a barrier.  I missed the Minister's response to that point.  We all see how effectively the French have been able to use technicalities over the years to protect not just their farming sector but other sectors.<\/p><p>  The British market is very important to us.  We are almost totally reliant on it at this time because of the significant fall-off in domestic consumption.  A previous speaker - it might have been the Minister - noted that 75% of the British market is supported by its own livestock.  We try to provide as much as possible of the remainder and, as such, it is of vital importance to the sector here.<\/p><p>  There is a slowdown in international demand which is coupled with changing tastes for different types of beef products.  To what extent are we endeavouring to track the trends in this regard and who is responsible for that task?  I did not get any sense of that from the Minister's speech.  This pertains to the issue of a regulator, which I will deal with presently, but whether that is the correct nomination for the type of role we are discussing, I am not sure.  Cattle reared in this country and finished in Northern Ireland are disadvantaged within the British market because of that.  Is there any way we might develop a different approach which would assist the bull market in that regard?  We are always talking about an all-island economy and, to be fair, it is evolving in some areas, particularly in the tourism area.  It would be useful to take that approach in this area by seeking some type of preferential treatment within the British market.  Perhaps our product could operate <i>pari passu<\/i> with British beef.  After all, whether the beef is reared in Fermanagh, say, or it is reared in Leitrim or Donegal, there really is no difference in the livestock itself.  Is there some avenue that could be explored in this regard?<\/p><p>  The fall in beef prices has consequences for our export trade and for farmers, but it also has consequences for employment.  That is a very significant factor that needs to be homed in on in the context of the high rate of unemployment pertaining in this country.  In referring to trends in the market, the Minister seemed to be putting the responsibility on farmers themselves to follow the sudden changes that can take place.  Sometimes these changes may not be consumer-driven but rather driven by other vested interests within the food chain, be it the multiples, the processor or whoever else.  There seems to be no accountability within that.  A small farmer operating in this market and concentrating on what he or she is doing is not in a position to determine what the trends are going to be next year or the year after.  As Senator O'Neill said, one might make a decision on gut instinct and it could turn out to be the right one.  Equally, however - we have seen this in other areas of agriculture and other industries - where one makes a decision on instinct or even makes what one assumes is an informed decision based on research, it might not prove to be the right one.  It is not adequate to pass the responsibility back to farmers in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned that the Competition Authority has a role in all of this.  We should bear in mind that the authority has had failures in many areas, a very significant one being in respect of the legal profession.  The latter is a gigantic cartel, particularly when it comes to barristers.  I do not say that lightly.<\/p> <p>The Law Library is supposed to have an oversupply of barristers, yet when one looks for a barrister one cannot get one at what one would consider a competitive or reasonable rate.  In that regard, the State has been the biggest culprit as it has for many years overpaid members of the legal profession for work that should have commanded much lower rates.  I am not sure I would like to rely specifically on that. <\/p><p>Teagasc, an arm of the State, promoted the bull beef sector.  What role does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have in this area, including on the issue of making predictions?  The Minister stated that farmers must plan better.  How can they do that?  What mechanism or system of supports should be provided?  Who should determine what are likely to be the market trends or should farmers be left at the mercy of the market?  My party has made a proposal, one which the Minister has dismissed, to establish a beef regulator.  While this country's history of regulation is not good, does the Minister have a better suggestion?  Should more than 65,000 farmers be left to the vagaries of the market? <\/p><p>I urge the Department to take a more hands-on approach.  I acknowledge, as other Senators have done, that the Minister has applied himself well and, unlike some of his colleagues, he has avoided pitfalls.  I ask him to take an initiative to assist bull beef farmers.  I have not heard anything that will give these farmers comfort that there is a solution on the horizon or that the matter will be addressed.  I urge the Minister to take seriously the suggestions we have made.  It is fine if others make better suggestions but the Minister should not dismiss Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposals simply on the basis of their origin.  I do not fully subscribe to the Minister's view that establishing a regulator would send out all the wrong signals.  The new mechanism would not have to be known as a regulator as the Minister is aware of the intent, function and job specification we are seeking to assist the sector.  If successful, this mechanism could provide a template for addressing other issues in agriculture.   I ask the Minister to examine the proposal constructively. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600026#Z00700","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395843300,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his official.  It is important that Senators are given an opportunity to raise this matter as it allows the Minister to take note of the many views on the issue being expressed in the House.  Beef producers find themselves in a very difficult position.  I live on an organic farm producing beef and lamb, which is run by my wife, Mary, and son, Conor.  The difficulty with producing organic beef is that we rely entirely on grass and having a good quality product.  The Department does not place much emphasis on promoting organic farming, an important, if expensive, side of farming.  Changes are needed to address the cost of registration and various other aspects of organic farming.  We rear beef and lamb to the finished product on the farm.  It is a quality product on which we must secure a return.  We do not buy in calves but keep maiden calves and heifers from which we breed.  From first-hand experience, I assure the Minister that the costs involved are substantial.  He must examine this issue and take whatever steps are required, including engaging with his counterparts in Northern Ireland and Britain.<\/p><p>On the issue of markets, when I was the Minister of State with responsibility for trade I was frequently assigned the task of working with Bord Bia.  I recall a particular visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran where I ensured that the Iranian Minister sent veterinary surgeons to Ireland.  They visited the Kepak company in Clonee, which coincidentally has a factory in Athleague in County Roscommon.  I assured them about the quality of Irish beef because our competitors elsewhere in the European Union, including in France, were arguing that Ireland shared a border with Britain, which was experiencing many animal health problems, including mad cow disease, at the time.

Many farmers who rear bull beef are not grass-based but use intensive protein feeding with a view to having the animals ready at 16 months.  Even they have found difficulties.  I accept there is not a lot of demand in the market for bulls who, having been initially grass fed and finished on protein, run on to 20 or 22 months.  Encouragement was given, particularly to younger farmers, to go down that road as there was a niche market.  They now find themselves in some difficulty.  Where that encouragement came from, I am not sure.  Young farmers in their 30s who embarked on these projects and find themselves in serious difficulty have outlined to me that they were encouraged, if not necessarily by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600027#AA01000","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395843900,"counter":175,"content":"<p>It was for under 20 month beef, though.

I wish to raise an issue related to HPAT which is the exam that students who wish to study medicine must undertake.<\/p> <p>Concerns have been raised recently in the media.  I think this examination was introduced in 2009.  I am not too sure about the extent of what it has achieved since 2009.  The concerns raised relate to over 700 people who attended a particular two-day course in preparation for this examination which was not part of their school curriculum.  It would appear that some of the questions were very similar to those they were given during this two-day course.  My understanding is that the course costs &euro;595 so we are now pushing entry into medicine into an exclusive area and it is an unfair system from the point of view of people who cannot afford to get the grind or attend these preparation courses.  <\/p><p>I ask that the entire idea of HPAT be reviewed.  Has it actually achieved anything?  Someone who might not get through HPAT this year might do it next year.  Does that make them a better doctor in six years' time?  I am not sure it does and I am not sure it is a way of assessing someone as regards working in medicine.  I know it was a system adopted from Australia but it is time we reviewed it to see whether it has achieved anything to date, whether it is likely to achieve anything and whether it is just an additional cost being imposed on parents which is unnecessary and will not achieve anything in real terms.  <\/p><p>Two thirds of all medical graduates are leaving this country within 12 months of graduating.   They have decided even before they have come out of college that once their intern year has been completed, they will leave.  The cost of medical education in this country per annum is &euro;90 million because it is a five-year course.  If one works it out at &euro;30,000 per student per annum, it is &euro;150,000 and with 600 students per year, it adds up to &euro;90 million.  Within 12 months of that investment, 60% of it goes out of the country.  It is time that we looked at the issue of medical education and also at HPAT to see if there is real value in it and whether it is necessary. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600030#DD00600","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Did Senator Burke indicate that he wished to share time with Senator Crown?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600031#EE00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600031#EE00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to the Cathaoirleach for giving me a small amount of time.  I did not realise that this item was on the agenda and I wanted to take advantage of the Minister of State's presence to state that this is an area about which I have had some concerns.  When the examination was first introduced, there were a number of high-profile cases of youngsters in this country who had full marks in the leaving certificate but who were not accepted for medical school.  The clear logic of that is that there was something that these children could be assessed on at the age of 17 or 18 which determined that 15 years hence, they would not be suitable to be appointed as specialists in hospital medicine or as general practitioners.  I do not accept that this is possible.  I expressed grave concerns at the time.  When we have a national examination in the leaving certificate which, in truth, is as incorruptible as anything can be and if we are going to accept children into professional courses like medicine after secondary school, this should be the final authority.<\/p><p>Let me go further.  The idea of accepting children into medical school after the leaving certificate is a mistake.  The time to do this is after they have had a phase of education at third level for three or four years.  We should move towards the models that exist in north America and other parts of the world where medicine is invariably a graduate programme.  Simply put, I was 14-years-old when I was making the subject choices for the leaving certificate in terms of going into medicine.  As it happened, I am extraordinarily happy that I did go into medicine but I do not think this is the way we should be educating and selecting people.  People should get a relatively broad education with a strong science focus, go on to third level education, get a full mature understanding of what is involved in a career in medicine and then make a decision as to whether they wish to practice it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600031#EE00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Burke for raising this Adjournment matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  At the outset, we should clarify that the selection criteria and process for admission to medical schools is a matter for the medical schools and universities in line with their statutory autonomy in respect of academic affairs.  I genuinely take the points that have been raised by Senators Burke and Crown in respect of the culture that exists around admissions to medicine.  I am not delivering the script entirely in that sense.  An international tender process was undertaken by the medical schools and the Australian Council for Educational Research, ACER, was chosen to administer the new entry process to medicine, which we know as HPAT.<\/p><p>The introduction of HPAT in 2009 had regard to the findings of &quot;Medical Education in Ireland: A New Direction. Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training&quot; or the Fottrell report.  It recommended that leaving certificate results should no longer be the sole selection method for entry to medical education at undergraduate level.  It recommended that a two-stage mechanism should be applied consisting of the results obtained in the leaving certificate and a standardised admissions test which would assess non-academic skills and attributes regarded as important for the practice of medicine.<\/p><p>In 2012, the group undertook a comprehensive evaluation of HPAT to determine the educational impact, reliability, validity and stakeholder acceptability of the new entry and selection approach.  It made the following recommendations.  HPAT-Ireland scores should be valid for a period of one year only instead of two years.  A redistribution should be applied to the weighting of HPAT-Ireland sections to reduce the contribution of section 3 scores to the overall score in order to reduce the impact of repeat effects.  Further practice material should be made available to all HPAT-Ireland applicants, which also includes some examples of correct responses and the rationales to these to ensure adequate opportunities for all to become familiar with the test format and sample items.  It was agreed that due consideration would be given to the need to ensure that students are given adequate notice of the changes proposed by the expert group.<\/p><p>An investigation is currently under way by ACER amid allegations that students who attended a HPAT preparation course had seen and were coached in how to answer certain questions that appeared in this year's HPAT examination.  ACER takes very seriously the integrity of candidates' results in HPAT.  The reliability and validity of its tests is therefore of paramount importance to ACER.  The investigation will first attempt to establish the degree, if any, of similarity between the test questions and those allegedly believed to have been provided by the coaching college in question.  I am given to understand that based on the briefings we have received that this process is extremely thorough.  Candidates' optical mark recognitions have to be scanned and re-scanned.  Data analysis has to be carried out by a minimum of two psychometricians.  There are many areas of analysis involved; the detection of anomalies is just one part of the standard analysis process.  The results of the investigation may lead to some test units being removed from all candidates' scores obtained in the 2014 examination.  The Department has asked that it be kept informed by the Higher Education Authority of progress on addressing this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600031#EE00500","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Does Senator Burke have a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600031#EE00600","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The fact that it costs &euro;595 to attend a two-day course is not dealt with in the reply.

I have spoken before about the importance of providing some kind of memorial or monument to the victims and survivors of abuse in industrial schools.  Many of these schools opened in the late 1800s at a time when Ireland was coming out of the traumatic event of the Famine.  They operated for almost one hundred years until the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s in some cases.<\/p><p>I raised this matter previously with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  At that time I referred to the report of the commission of inquiry into child abuse and in particular chapter eight which dealt with Letterfrack.  It stated that corporal punishment was severe, excessive, pervasive and created a climate of fear.  That situation existed in many of these industrial schools where young children were frightened out of their wits.  Revelations are still coming out in the inquiry currently being held in the North.  I paid a visit to Letterfrack - a bleak place - in order to pay my respects to the many thousands of people who had passed through the gates.  There was not so much as a signpost or a memorial plaque in the place to tell the visitor what had happened in this place.  The home that housed the brothers who were the perpetrators of the abuse was being used as a hostel and it took a great deal of digging and looking around to find the little graveyard which is hidden by a grove of trees up at the back and which held many children who died in care.  <\/p><p>I was amazed that these horrors and memories seemed to have been brushed under the carpet.  It seems to me that not much has happened since my visit.  These places were located throughout the length and breadth of the country, from Glin in County Limerick to Grangegorman, from Cashel to Ballaghadereen.  There were approximately 130 of these places.<\/p><p>We cannot even begin to understand the psychological scars left by clerical abuse on families and many members of the community.  When I was working in London I met Irish men and lads who were homeless and the common thread between them was that they had come from these institutions.  For example, a man who was abused as a child wanders around in my own village and he is still trying to come to terms with what happened to him.<\/p><p>I refer to the reports about clerical abuse, the Ryan report and the report into abuse in Cloyne.  The psychological scars take a lot of healing.  The last time I raised this matter in the Chamber the late Christine Buckley was in the Visitors Gallery.  I salute her bravery in speaking about the abuse she suffered as a child in Goldenbridge.  That took tremendous courage on her part.  It took Christine Buckley 15 years of therapy and counselling to be in a position to speak.  There are many individuals and families who are still going through that trauma and suffering.  I am aware that planning permission for a proposed memorial in Parnell Square has been refused.  I suggested to the Minister that places under the control of the VEC such as the former industrial school in Letterfrack should be opened up to allow for a lasting memorial to be created where people can go and see what went on.  I am sure the Minister of State will welcome the &euro;10 million provided by the Catholic Church for the Nano Nagle centre.  While celebrating a fantastic woman who is to become a saint, the church should really be looking into commemorating the darker side of what happened rather than shying away from it.  Memorials will be a means of helping the healing process and allow people to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600032#FF00400","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1395845400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I take the point he makes about Letterfrack.  The building is currently being used as a furniture and craftwork school.  I have visited the village of Letterfrack.  Sometimes out of misery and turmoil comes something that is creative.  The folk memory of people who live in the area of Letterfrack will ensure what happened there will never be forgotten.  I note his point about the creation of a physical memorial in that region.<\/p><p>The provision of a memorial to victims of institutional abuse was one of the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  The Ryan report noted the importance of the State's formal recognition of the abuse that occurred and the suffering of victims being preserved in a permanent place.  A committee was appointed in October 2009 to oversee the design and commissioning of the memorial and a budget of &euro;500,000 was set aside.  The committee was chaired by Sean Benton, a former chairman of the OPW.  The committee consulted widely during 2010 and it then pursued a two-stage international competition in conjunction with the OPW.  The competition was launched in July 2011 and the design brief noted that there were no preconceived ideas regarding the design of the memorial.  The OPW agreed to make the site adjacent to the Garden of Remembrance available as a permanent location for the memorial in the event of it taking the form of a physical artefact.  However, entrants were not limited to this site and could make a submission for other State-owned sites.  Six of the 32 submissions received in the first stage of the competition were short listed; four of these short-listed entries were proposals for the site in Parnell Square.  Having met with the short listed entrants and assessed their detailed, specific proposal, the competition jury unanimously decided to award the commission to Studio Negri and Hennessy &amp;amp; Associates, for the Journey of Light memorial.  The jury felt that the manner in which the proposed memorial integrated with the Garden of Remembrance would provide an enduring symbol of lost innocence to inspire future generations to ensure the protection of all children.<\/p> <p> Following the announcement of the competition winner in July 2012, the OPW sought and received planning permission from Dublin City Council, subject to a range of conditions, in May 2013.  The grant of permission was appealed by a third party and An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused planning permission for the proposal in November, as the Senator outlined in his submission.  The board believed that the proposed memorial would have had an adverse impact on the setting, character and function of the Garden of Remembrance.<\/p><p>We sought the views of the memorial committee on the decision's implications.  The committee has advised that the journey of light proposal is not transferable to another site, as it is inextricably linked with the Garden of Remembrance.  Neither does it consider that the board's decision should be appealed, as it would be divisive and not in the best interests of the project.  It believes that any new competition should be open to conceptual and site-specific proposals and that a central Dublin location should be identified as a cost neutral basis with appropriate zoning.  The officials in my Department are consulting the OPW on the identification of a suitable central Dublin location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600032#FF00500","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395846000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  It is good that the proposal is still being pursued.  The city centre location should be prominent.  I urge the Minister of State to consider using other buildings under the control of the Department of Education and Skills, for example, that at Letterfrack.  I am sure there are others across the country.  A former school in my neck of the woods was sold for big money to Limerick FC.  As Mr. Mannix Flynn stated, what happened was like our Holocaust.  Let us not underestimate what occurred in the institutions.  I visited Germany and saw stark memorials that were very much in keeping with what happened there.  Buildings and various methods were used.  If there is not to be a city centre memorial, one of the living, breathing buildings in question should be used to commemorate what happened in them.  This suggestion should be considered by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600033#GG00200","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","time":1395846000,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600033#GG00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1395846000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I tabled this debate to highlight the impact that the underfunding of Beechpark Services and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, is having on children in the north Dublin area.  It makes it impossible for children with autism and other special needs to get a proper education and puts their welfare and that of their fellow pupils at risk.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State is aware, Beechpark is a regional, community-based HSE service that provides specialised clinical supports for children with autism who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychological services that Beechpark provides are essential to the personal development and education of children with autism.  Without these therapeutic services, children with special needs cannot get a proper education.  It is distressing for the children and their parents and teachers to be deprived of this essential service.<\/p><p>Schools that have opened special autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units want to be able to provide the education that the children in their care need and deserve, but they are being frustrated in their efforts by the lack of therapeutic and psychological supports.  One school has advised me that the underfunding of Beechpark Services and the CAMHS has created a serious risk to the welfare and safety of its pupils as a whole.  The school has asked me not to identify it on the record, but I have sent details of its name and specific incidents to the Ministers and Minister of State, Deputies Reilly, Quinn and Kathleen Lynch, via private correspondence.<\/p><p>The school was traditionally served by Beechpark Services.  Eight of its existing 24 pupils in ASD classes are getting services from Beechpark, but the others are not because Beechpark is not in a position to take on new enrolments.  Children who need therapeutic interventions like occupational therapy and speech and language therapy are not getting them.  As a result, some of those students have become impossible to manage and are presenting a danger to themselves and others.  The primary school in question has had to expel a child this year due to a serious assault.  One of the students about whom the principal is concerned is an eight year old boy who has self-harmed.  Another has assaulted the principal and other staff a number of times.  There was a further serious incident yesterday.  The principal rang me extremely upset after a student ransacked a classroom and created a dangerous situation for the student in question, the teacher and the other children who were present.  The principal is concerned that a pupil or teacher will be seriously hurt if these children do not get the help they need as soon as possible.<\/p><p>In addition to needing occupational therapy and speech and language services from Beechpark, some children also need mental health interventions.  Indeed, some pupils were previously being served by the CAMHS, but it was withdrawn and they were referred to Beechpark.  Since Beechpark cannot take them, they have been left with no services.  The principal has also told me of instances of children who, having received a mental health service from the CAMHS at preschool age, saw it withdrawn as soon as they were enrolled in a special ASD unit in the school, presumably on the assumption that they would receive the service there.  However, there is no one at the school to provide it.  Yesterday, the principal was determined to stress to me that an ASD class in a mainstream school was not a medical intervention and that it was inappropriate for children to have medical interventions withdrawn simply because they had been enrolled in an educational service.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate the seriousness of this issue.  I have called for this debate to bring the matter to his attention.  I appreciate that he is representing the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and I hope he will raise it with the Minister.  I hope the reply he has been given by the Department on the Minister's behalf will outline when funding will be provided to ensure that Beechpark and CAMHS can serve all of the children who have been assessed as needing their services.  When will early intervention teams be in place in Dublin North so that children with special needs can get the assistance they deserve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600033#GG00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1395846000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health.  The HSE's 2012 report, entitled National Review of Autism Services Past, Present and Way Forward, and the programme for progressing disability services for children and young people, that is, zero to 18 years of age, set out the overall policy context for the provision of ASD services to children and young people.  The latter's objective is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services for children with disabilities, including those with ASD.  It provides for a clear pathway to services for all children regardless of where they live, what school they attend and the nature of their disabilities and that available resources be used to the best effect.  A key part of the programme is its emphasis on strong links with primary care and specialist services such as CAMHS.  The programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that persist throughout the country.<\/p><p>In 2014, the HSE is taking a number of key steps in implementing the reorganisation of services in line with the programme.  An additional &euro;4 million has been allocated, equating to 80 additional therapy staff, to support the initiative.  As part of the programme's roll-out in 2014, local implementation groups, LIGs, in Dublin North, including the north city, and Dublin South, Dublin South-East, Dublin South-West and Dublin South-Central will finalise their consultation phase, complete implementation plans and begin reconfiguration and service delivery in line with the new service model.  The Minister is confident that this will have a positive impact on the provision of therapeutic services for all children requiring access to health-related supports, including those with ASD.<\/p><p>I recognise the distinction made by the Senator and the challenge facing the principal of the school in question.  As the Senator is aware, Beechpark is a regional HSE service that provides clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of ASD up to 18 years of age who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The HSE indicates that, in recent years, demands on this service have increased through a growth in the number of new classes for children with ASD.<\/p> <p> While Beechpark, like other health service providers, must live within the financial and other constraints applying, it endeavours to provide services on the basis of prioritised need.  In respect of Beechpark North, the HSE has indicated that all permanent staff vacancies that arose in 2013 have been filled.  In addition, six posts which have been approved are currently in the recruitment phase with the HSE national recruitment service.  Importantly, the HSE has also assigned a disability manager to oversee the reconfiguration of services for children with disabilities in Dublin North and Dublin north city in line with the national progressing disabilities programme for children and young people.  The Beechpark service is actively involved in the change process in the context of the local implementation groups that have been established across Dublin North-East and Dublin Mid-Leinster under the HSE's progressing disability services programme.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of access to child and adolescent mental health services.  A major reform of mental health services is also currently underway, in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  That is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  Additional funding of &euro;90 million has been provided over the last three budgets to support this reform programme.  A key priority in this regard is to enhance and streamline the way in which the mainstream mental health and disability care programmes look after children and young people up to 18 years of age.  There are currently 61 multidisciplinary child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams in place.  Work is under way to enhance the skills mix of these teams and to recruit additional CAMHS posts.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding an increasing demand for mental health services, the focus on improving services will continue.  Targeted investment of &euro;20 million has been provided by the Government for new initiatives this year.  This will include CAMHS services in north Dublin and the provision of services for hyperkenetic and other attentional problems among children and young people.  While the current economic situation in the country is presenting challenges, the Minister is committed to protecting front-line services, including children's disability and autism services, to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600033#GG00500","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395846600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the Minister is replying on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, but I have written to the Minister about Beechpark Services previously and the issue has been raised by my colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, and other Deputies in the D&aacute;il over the last two years.  To be honest, the reply has not really changed since then.  The Department is still referring to the fact that a review is being undertaken.<\/p><p>The reality is that the services are massively under-funded.  There are no early intervention teams in Dublin North at present and children are waiting for massive lengths of time to access the child and adolescent mental health services.  One of the children I mentioned earlier is an eight year old who self-harmed.  Before the child self-harmed, the school principal referred him to CAMHS but it was only after he had hurt himself that the parent was able to get an urgent appointment.  The reality is that the services simply are not there.  Beechpark is not serving most of the children in the ASD classes in this school.<\/p><p>The Department's reply referred to the fact that there is an increase in demand because more ASD classes have opened.  However, they did not open for no reason, but because the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education have been working with schools to get them to open the classes in response to the need.  They have been doing their best to provide the services that are required on the educational side.  The special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are doing a good job in matching children with the resources that are available.  However, the missing part of the picture in all of this is the health provision.  Despite the best efforts of the SENOs and the schools involved, the health provision is simply not available.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is replying on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I ask him to bring this issue to his attention, stress the urgency and ask him to look at that correspondence personally, rather than just having it looked at by somebody else in the Department.  He must ask the Minister to look at the letter I sent to him about the specific incidents I have mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600034#HH00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1395846600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I accept the point made by the Senator, but I must be frank with the House.  Economic history did not start in 2011.  In terms of the allocation of resources, we were handed a deck of cards in 2011 and to be fair, with regard to this service, I will defend this Government.  It has provided over &euro;90 million in the last three budgets to support a reform programme.  In respect of the roll-out of a more networked system of provision of services for young people, we are facing these challenges across the country.  As a Government Minister I am facing the same problems in my area as the Senator is facing in her area.  Only last week I had a meeting with some of the teams there to see how we can work through some of the problems.<\/p><p>There is no question that there is a deficit and a growing demand with regard to CAMHS.  I openly acknowledge that, but we are doing our best to work on addressing these deficits within the economic constraints that exist.  The economic constraints continue but I envisage that they will get better, because we have a Minister who is determined to ensure there is a specific silo, as it were, to provide for these services.  While I acknowledge what the Senator has said, she must also acknowledge, if we are to be realistic and objective in any debate of this nature, the reasons that we are in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014032600034#HH00300","speaker":"979"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1395846600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 3.56 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 April 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
