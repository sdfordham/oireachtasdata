An enhanced regional approach to delivering full European energy market integration is proposed.  In this regard, Ireland has witnessed the benefits of regional co-operation since the establishment of the single electricity market in November 2007.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The benefits of the single energy market include improved security of supply, competitive prices and increased penetration of renewable energy, each of which is a goal of the energy union proposals.  The completion of the North-South transmission line project will significantly enhance Ireland's level of interconnection with the UK.  Similarly, additional interconnections with France and the UK would further enhance our connectivity and bring benefits in security, competitiveness and sustainability.<br\/><br\/>To help the creation of an integrated EU energy market, the European Commission has drawn up a list of projects of common interest.  These projects are proposed by infrastructure developers, and the list contains several possible projects relating to Ireland.  While the projects are at various stages of development, with some of them still conceptual and possibly never coming to fruition, some of the projects could potentially underpin further integration into regional markets through additional interconnection.  The North-South transmission line project is included on the list of projects, as is the possible interconnection with France.  Several interconnectors with the UK are also listed, some of which relate to the possibility of trading renewable electricity with the UK after 2020.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Department is engaging with the European Commission to clarify Ireland's current level of interconnection.  Depending on the variables used in the calculation, the level of a country's interconnection can vary.  I am advised that, at a minimum, Ireland has around 11% of electricity interconnection.  Notwithstanding this, Ireland would welcome additional investment to increase our connectivity, and opportunities will be pursued where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200005#C00900","speaker":"997","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>How advanced is the planning for the interconnector with France, what is the latest research on the project, and when is it likely to happen?

The Government's national broadband plan aims to deliver a minimum high speed broadband service of 30 Mbps to every home and business in Ireland.  This State intervention can be delivered over a number of different technology platforms and, in designing an intervention strategy and a procurement process, we must be mindful of complying fully with EU state aid guidelines by being technology neutral and not favouring one technology over another.  These guidelines do, however, allow for fibre to be deployed as close to the end user as possible.  Retail telecommunications providers would then be free to use a variety of technology platforms to reach the final customer.  We also need to ensure that State investment delivers a network that can meet current and anticipated future demand.  It must be capable of ensuring that there is no urban-rural digital divide and that rural based businesses and residents are not at a disadvantage compared with those in urban areas.<\/p>  <p> The planned intervention is being designed to deal conclusively with the rural connectivity challenge.  The comprehensive mapping exercise we completed in late 2014 shows a clear fibre backhaul deficit in many parts of rural Ireland.  This will need to be addressed in any intervention.  The intention is to design a clear specification around the services we wish to see delivered and then allow the bidders to submit tenders based on their ability to meet these specification requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200006#D00900","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I cannot avoid the conclusion that many parts of rural Ireland are going to be left with mobile broadband.  One of the few good things the Government did was set out a legislative basis for using the electricity network to provide fibre wrapped broadband throughout the country.  In respect of state aid rules, surely the Government could decide to provide a fibre wrapped network to every house and connection on the ESB network, which would then be made available to all the commercial operators.  This would be similar to the way in which the Eircom network was unbundled.  That option would ensure that the broadband deficit would be dealt with in a way that would give equal access to everybody in this country to the benefits of broadband.  At this stage, speeds of 30 Mbps are nearly obsolete.  We need to be looking at 100 Mbps or more to deliver an adequate broadband service.  The only way of meeting this objective is by fibre wrapping the electricity network and subsequently opening it up to market forces, or whatever forces one wants, to provide the end service to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200006#D01000","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>We have to get it right conclusively.

In rural areas, somebody employed by, for example, Pramerica in Letterkenny should be able to work from home in Malin Head or Killybegs.  That is the critical issue.  The national broadband plan aims to address areas in which commercial companies are not interested.  It is not commercially viable to go into these areas.  A potential solution, as Deputy Pringle correctly noted, is to wrap fibre around the ESB network.<\/p><p>However, the Government is constrained in what it can do because of EU guidelines and state intervention rules.  Most of these rural areas have wireless broadband, so there are competition issues in terms of whether the State can go in and compete with another provider.  We must be very clear in what we are doing and we must be technology neutral.  The Deputy is correct that a potential option is wrapping fibre around the ESB network.  That network goes to Arranmore Island, Tory Island and other peripheral areas.  There is also the Eircom network, however, and the question then is which one to choose.  Where we are at in the process is ensuring we are proceeding on a legally sound basis to deliver broadband, finally and conclusively, to rural areas.

That is a serious problem because the people living there are entitled to the same connectivity as everybody else.  I do not accept that the Department is as constrained as the Minister of State has suggested in terms of being unable to pick one technology over another.  We have to make all technologies available to people and they will decide which they want to access.

Licence fee revenues are distributed in accordance with section 123 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 in the following prescribed manner.  From the gross TV licence fee receipts, the Department first deducts commission payable to An Post in respect of its role as the Minister's issuing agent for TV licences.  TG4 also currently receives &euro;9.245 million from the gross receipts.  Following these deductions, 7% of the net revenue is paid to the broadcasting funding scheme.  The scheme, which is operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, was established to provide funding in support of the production of high quality programmes by independent producers and broadcasters on Irish culture, heritage and experience, and programmes to improve adult literacy.  The scheme also supports certain archiving projects being undertaken by broadcasters.  Any revenues remaining following these payments are provided to RTE.  The purpose of the TV licence revenues paid to RTE and TG4 is to facilitate the pursuit of each broadcaster's public service objectives, which are set out in the 2009 Act.<\/p><p>Statutorily mandated annual and five yearly reviews are conducted by the BAI which must consider whether each broadcaster has fulfilled the commitments set out in its annual statement and make a recommendation as to whether there should be an adjustment to the level of public funding. The first five-year review was undertaken in 2013 and this work included a wide-ranging process of stakeholder engagement with market players and other interested parties, involving both face-to-face interviews and written submissions.<\/p><p>The results of that review, and the Government response to it, acknowledge the very significant programme of cost savings implemented by RTE since 2008, whereby it has reduced its operating costs by 30% and reduced its staff by more than 500 people.  Members will be aware that a service which was provided in the UK has been taken off the air.  It is also worth noting that these efficiencies were achieved in a period where RTE's annual revenues fell by 26% and where, despite the impact of this period of restructuring on the broadcaster, RTE continued to deliver its full range of services and achieved a break-even position in 2013.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government response to the five-year review tasked NewERA with conducting an independent assessment of the scope for further efficiencies within RTE, including an examination of achievable efficiencies in its performing groups service model and the manner in which it delivers Irish language radio services.

This group of amendments provides for changes to the definitions which apply throughout the Bill.  The purpose of the amendments is to provide for additional clarity and certainty.  Amendment No. 3, in particular, provides a new definition of &quot;donation facility&quot;.  This is to ensure that if gametes are donated to a facility which deals with donation but does not provide other donor assisted reproduction services, this does not preclude the use of these gametes by facilities in the State.

The other intending parent consents to being a parent of a child born as a result of the procedure but does not request the procedure. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 clarifies the definition of the term &quot;relevant donor&quot;.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 make some linked changes to the definition of the term &quot;donor&quot;.  This was necessary because on some occasions where an embryo is donated, a donor of the embryo for whose use the embryo was originally formed may or may not himself or herself have a genetic connection with the embryo.  Only the information of a relevant donor, being a donor who provided a gamete used in forming the embryo, should be recorded on the national donor-conceived person register.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 16 are direct consequential amendments to this new definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200011#J00800","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426157400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426157400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote>In page 11, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:&quot; &quot;donation facility&quot; means a place at which a person provides and donates his or her gamete, and includes a DAHR facility;&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200011#J01000","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426157400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426157400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<blockquote>In page 11, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:&quot;and includes a donor of a gamete that is used in the formation of an embryo that is used in a further DAHR procedure,&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200011#J01200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426157400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426157400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<blockquote>In page 11, to delete lines 17 to 21 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(b) in relation to an embryo, means&mdash;<blockquote>(i) a person who has consented under <i>section 14<\/i>or <i>14 <\/i>or in the manner referred to in <i>section 24(2)(b)(ii)<\/i>, to the use of the embryo in a DAHR procedure or a further DAHR procedure, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) the donor of an embryo to which <i>section 24(6) <\/i>applies;&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200011#J01400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426157400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426157400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<blockquote>In page 11, to delete lines 34 to 38, and in page 12, to delete line 1 and substitute the following:&quot; &quot;intending mother&quot; means, in relation to a DAHR procedure, a woman who requests the performance of the procedure for the purpose of her becoming the mother of a child born as a result of the procedure;<br \/><br \/>&quot;intending parent&quot; means, in relation to a DAHR procedure, a person who intends to be the parent, under <i>section 5<\/i>, of a child born as a result of the procedure, and includes an intending mother;&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200011#J01600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426157400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426157400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<blockquote>In page 12, to delete lines 13 to 15 and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot; &quot;relevant donor&quot; means, in relation to a donor-conceived child&mdash;(a) subject to <i>paragraph (b)<\/i>, the donor of a gamete that was used in the DAHR procedure that resulted in the birth of the donor-conceived child, and<br \/><br \/>(b) in the case of a donor-conceived child who is born as a result of a DAHR procedure or a further DAHR procedure in which a donated embryo was used&mdash;<blockquote>(i) a donor of the embryo who provided a gamete that was used in the formation of the embryo, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) where applicable, the donor of a gamete that was used in the formation of the embryo.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200011#J01800","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426157400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426157400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<blockquote>In page 13, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:&quot;(9) The intending parents of a donor-conceived child must undergo counselling prior to their initiation of DAHR.&quot;.<\/blockquote>This amendment has been tabled in response to representations made by clinicians.

It is striking to consider the number of couples availing of fertility treatment here and I accept the Deputy's point on donor-assisted human reproduction.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated on Committee Stage, the Bill focuses entirely on one aspect of assisted and donor-assisted human reproduction, namely, parentage issues.  Responsibility for the wider issues involved remains fully within the remit of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  On the day the Cabinet approved this Bill, it also gave the Minister permission to draft legislation on the wider area of assisted human reproduction, AHR, which has remained unregulated since 2005.  This was a very welcome decision.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's proposal will deal with the wide range of AHR issues that need to be addressed.  I will discuss later the large number of AHR issues which have not received any attention until now, all of which come within the remit of the bioethics unit of the Department of Health.  This unit assumed responsibility for providing information to Cabinet, including the proposed heads of the Bill.  The head of the unit has been working with my Department on the issues involved.  The wider issues will be considered in the subsequent legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The counselling of individuals or couples who are considering or planning treatment is very much within the policy area of the Minister for Health.  His proposals in this regard, which were recently approved by the Government, include requirements that people availing of all forms of assisted human reproduction undergo counselling in advance of treatment.  This has been accepted in principle.  I have discussed these issues with clinicians involved in assisted human reproduction and they are very clear on the need for counselling.  However, the clinics are not currently regulated.  The Medical Council has developed guidelines to which the professionals adhere and each clinic has its own guidelines.  We want to reach the position where national guidelines are implemented in the clinics.<\/p>  <p>  I hope Deputy Mac Lochlainn will understand that while I support the principle underpinning his amendment, I cannot accept it because the Bill's scope in respect of assisted human reproduction is limited.  The legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Health will address the issue he raises.  Responsibility for matters such as the precise nature of counselling, the way in which counselling should be made available and how much counselling couples should avail of rests with the Department of Health.  I give the Deputy a commitment that counselling will be addressed in the Bill to be introduced by the Minister for Health.  The Government has accepted the Minister's proposal in principle.

It ensures that if, having completed treatment, they wish to donate any remaining embryos, they may do so.  Their donation must be in accordance with the same general conditions that apply where a donor embryo was formed using donor gametes.  In particular, if there is a child born later as a result of their donation, their details will be recorded on the national donor-conceived person register in order that the child's identity rights will be safeguarded.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 20 is consequential on amendment No. 19.

nature of a donor's consent referred to in subsections (5)(b) and (6)(c).  Both subsections refer to gametes and embryos, possibly anonymously sourced, which are the subject of certain transitional arrangements.  The original information specified that the consent should be substantially the same as that provided in sections 6 and 14.  However, given that those consents are so focused on the identity of the donors, I concluded that this threshold was too high and would make the transition provision unworkable.  Accordingly, I have changed those to specify that the donor has consented to the use of the gamete or embryo in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure.  The revised provision also includes a new subsection (8) which clarifies that where a person or a couple have existing embryos created using an intending parent's gamete and a donor gamete, there is no legal barrier to their using those embryos in a DAHR procedure.  There are also consequential amendments and cross-references to the new section that is inserted by amendment No. 19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200013#L01900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426158600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426158600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 34:<blockquote>In page 26, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:&quot;(8) A transition period of 12 months, from the date of enactment, will be allowed for cases where patients have already selected or paid for anonymous sperm donors or have the donation currently in storage in Irish clinics awaiting use in treatment, to complete their treatment cycles.<br \/><br \/>(9) A transition period of 12 months, from the date of enactment, will be allowed for cases where individuals have already initiated the process of anonymous egg donation, to complete their treatment cycles.<br \/><br \/>(10) A transition period will be allowed for cases of treatment resulting in a sibling child from an anonymous donor for a period of 3 years from the birth of the first child or 3 years from the date of enactment, whichever of the two is longer.&quot;.<\/blockquote>The Minister gave me assurances on this issue on Committee Stage.

The amendment would provide for a transition period to allow couples currently undertaking donor-assisted human reproduction procedures to continue their treatment and to facilitate an orderly move to the regulatory framework, which is envisaged in Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill.  The Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists also raised this issue and, obviously, the availability of such a transition would be of huge concern to many couples.<\/p>  <p>  These provisions have to be worked on further and more detail is needed.  On Committee Stage I indicated my broad agreement that such a transitional period had its merits and, indeed, I believe it is necessary.  As the Deputy has outlined, certain transitional provisions are already included in section 20(5) and 20(6).  The Deputy's provision in the proposed subsection (10) would, to some extent, cut across the provisions set out in subsection (6), which sets out a three-year period that is, effectively, a four-year period, given the transition period of at least one year from the commencement date.  This is to allow the couple to have a sibling using gametes from the same anonymous donor.<\/p>  <p>  I said on Committee Stage that I was prepared to offer a clear commitment to the House, together with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, that Parts 2 and 3 would not be commenced for a minimum period of one year from the date of enactment.  I repeat that commitment today to ensure that the interests of the many couples undergoing the stresses of donor-assisted fertility treatment can, with their medical teams, continue their treatment.  The one-year period will provide at least the same transition period, which will enable couples currently undergoing treatment to continue with that treatment and will give clinics time to prepare for the new regulatory framework.  This is a practical and pragmatic administrative solution for which I am today giving a binding commitment in order to enable a seamless transition to the new arrangements.  On the basis of that, I ask Deputy Mac Lochlainn not to press the amendment.  I have given a very clear commitment in regard to accepting the need for a transition period as well as outlining how long that will be in both instances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200013#L02200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426158600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Based on those very welcome and firm assurances, I am very happy to withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200013#L02300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426158600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426158600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 35, in the name of Deputy Lucinda Creighton, is out of order because it does not arise from committee proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200013#L02500","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426158600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 35 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426158600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 36 to 38, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200013#L02700","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1426158600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 36:<blockquote>In page 27, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:&quot;(1) An operator of a donation facility shall retain--<blockquote>(a) a written consent of a person made under <i>section 6<\/i>, and<br \/><br \/>(b) a record of the revocation, under <i>section 8<\/i>, by a person referred to in <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>of his or her consent.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This is related to records and consents.

As the Deputy knows, anonymous donations are accepted in this country.  That means, in effect, that a child has no access to genetic information.  This Bill and the new AHR Bill make it absolutely clear that as a policy and principle a child has the right to have access to that information.  It is the first time we are including in legislation the very relevant point the Deputy made, that is, that a child is entitled to have access to that information.  There will be a change in the regulations from anonymous to non-anonymous so that a child will have access to genetic information.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is very clear in its provisions on consent.  The rules on donor consent in respect of parentage will state it must be given very clearly.  The kind of information which must be kept will be very clear in the consent forms, which will have to be developed under regulations.  There is an issue around the arrangement to develop and record the information, and I have spoken about how the records will have to be kept by the relevant clinics.  The information will have to be gathered and available.  The issue of consent is relevant to this discussion.  <\/p>  <p>  A register of information will have to be kept in the Department of Health to begin with, but will then move to the new authority when it is established.  Much like having access to adoption information, procedures and information such as these are very sensitive.  It would be the responsibility of parents to share this information.  Parents will know that their children are entitled to this information.  In the same manner as adoption, the best practice is to tell a child at an early stage that he or she is adopted.  We are moving towards more open adoption.  As in the case of adoption, in cases of assisted human reproduction the best practice, as I have been informed based on a review of the international literature, is that the more open parents can be with children, the better the outcome.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Bill progresses, we will have the same sort of supportive system we would like to have for those seeking information on adoption.  The Minister, and eventually the authority, will develop procedures on that information.  The information applies to those who are 18 years of age, but this provision deals with non-identifying information.  It will be available before that.

It is very fundamental and should not have been rushed, a point I want to repeat.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister what the arrangements will be for passing on that information.  When an 18 year old requests his or her birth certificate, what will be the arrangements for telling that person there is additional information?

It would be non-identifying information, in that a donor's name would not be given at that point.  Non-identifying health information would be given and collected in the first instance by the clinic.  We had a debate on the Bill on Committee Stage, at which Deputy Shortall was not present, and there was no guillotine in terms of Members' opportunities to contribute, nor was there on Second Stage when 60 Members made contributions.  It is true that we are prioritising and allocating time to the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The details of what could be called the support system that would be built around the provision of the information is something that will be developed in the AHR legislation.  This is not retrospective, except in very particular instances such as where court proceedings allow for it in certain very clear situations.  This is prospective.  When a child is 18 years of age, he or she will have access to identifying information.  There is time to develop regulations and best practice, which should be in the best interests of the child, on the provision of this information.  <\/p>  <p>  We have had detailed contact with the Department of Social Protection on the necessary changes to the register.  This information is like that concerning adoption, where there is a different type of birth certificate.  In cases of AHR or DAHR, the person seeking a birth certificate will be told extra information is available.  I agree with the Deputy that this is critical for individuals and that is the reason the Bill addresses that point, namely, that the identity of the donor must be known.  These are very basic decisions about genetic identity.  <\/p>  <p>  As Sweden did 20 years ago, we are moving to known donation.  It is the right practice.  If a child has the right to genetic information, procedures on how a child and parent can access that information will be established.  It is part of a continuum.  One part is moving from anonymous to known donation.  The second part is the issue of consent and making sure it is built into our legislation very clearly.

This gave rise to some concern that the identity rights of the child would not be properly safeguarded.  In light of those discussions, I have decided to further refine the provisions, and amendment No. 40 removes the reference to the &quot;well-being&quot; of the donor or donor-conceived child being affected.  This is too subjective a threshold, and a number of Deputies spoke about this on Committee Stage.  I am clarifying the highly exceptional nature of any decision to withhold donor information by providing that the information can be withheld only when it would affect the &quot;safety&quot; of the donor or the donor-conceived child.  I should stress that I consider it highly unlikely that information will ultimately be withheld on this basis but I consider it essential to ensure that the Minister for Health or the authority to be established has some means of dealing with any truly exceptional circumstances which may arise.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 41 makes further associated provision by clarifying that the Minister will have the scope to provide a donor-conceived child with the reasons for refusal.

The strong presumption, as I mentioned to Deputy Shortall, based on the initial consents made by a donor, is that donor information will be released to a child.  If the Minister so decides, and the donor objects, he or she will have the usual right to apply to the courts for a review of that decision.<\/p><p>We had much discussion on Committee Stage about the terms and what may be exceptional circumstances.  In order to really make it clear that we see this as something extremely unusual and an exceptional circumstance, I was advised, legally, that I needed to include an exclusion in case there was a circumstance where the information would compromise the safety of the child.

These are intended to address some of the concerns raised on Second Stage and further discussed on Committee Stage on the position of non-marital fathers.  There was some disagreement but many Deputies supported automatic guardianship.  Others spoke about supporting automatic guardianship but felt there should be exceptions but there was no agreement on what those exceptions should be, although Deputies raised the issues of domestic violence and rape, where fathers were not involved and the situation that would arise and the difficulties that would face the mother in those circumstances.  My aim, pending further policy analysis on automatic guardianship, is to provide better information to parents from the outset.  I take the point that was made on several occasions that many, particularly young, fathers are not aware that they can make a statutory declaration of fatherhood now and do not use that mechanism.  This set of amendments is designed to ensure that parents are aware of the option of statutory declarations and can easily avail of them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 46 will delete certain elements required to make a statutory declaration making a non-marital father a guardian of his child.  Section 2(4)(<i>d<\/i>) of the 1964 Act provided that the parents of the child concerned must have made arrangements in relation to custody of, and access to, the child.  In general, parents will not make a statutory declaration unless they are on good terms, and possibly cohabiting in any case.  In such cases, the requirement for &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo; to be made is not a useful or meaningful one.  Although the custody and access arrangements referred to do not need to be through formal written arrangements, removing the requirement to have such arrangements may be useful in removing a perceived barrier to making a statutory declaration when registering the child's birth.  Amendments Nos. 57 to 59, inclusive, make the same change in relation to a statutory declaration to be made by cohabiting parents who have a child through donor-assisted human reproduction, and the same considerations apply.<\/p><p>These changes are a useful support to amendment No. 83.  Deputy Collins tabled an amendment on this issue.  My amendment is intended to provide better information to non-marital parents and to make it easier for fathers to become guardians of their children, where they are not cohabiting in a family unit.  The existing mechanism of making a statutory declaration is a simple and inexpensive one but there is insufficient awareness of its existence and many parents simply do not use it.  With approximately one third of births being outside marriage, it is important to ensure parents are aware of their rights and responsibilities and of how to secure them.  This amendment to the Civil Registration Act 2004 is to achieve that aim.  Where the parents or either of them register the birth of their child, the registrar will give them a copy of the statutory declaration in order that they can consider whether to make a statutory declaration appointing the father or second parent as a guardian of the child, witnessed by the registrar.  They do not need to decide then and there.  They can jointly make the declaration, witnessed by the registrar, within two weeks of registering or re-registering the child&rsquo;s birth - my understanding is that at present the birth has to be registered within three months - that is, 14 days after that three months.  The couple decides when to register the birth and has 14 days after that, with the registrar to make the statutory declaration.  The couple does not have to make the declaration to the registrar and some couples may not.  The father may not undertake a statutory declaration for quite a long time after that and it is still completely open to the couple to make the statutory declaration in the usual format before a peace commissioner or commissioner of oaths.  The registrar will not charge any fee for witnessing the statutory declaration and we intend to ensure information is provided wherever births are registered about the statutory declaration.  Several Deputies said there was no information about the statutory declaration, whether in maternity hospitals or when the couple went to register the birth.  This makes it easier.  If the parents decide not to make the statutory declaration at that time, there is nothing to prevent their doing so at a later point.<\/p><p>This approach will ensure that from the commencement of these provisions, which will be without undue delay, non-marital parents will have the necessary information to decide jointly whether the father will be a guardian of the child.  Coupled with ensuring they have the necessary information, they will also be able to make the statutory declaration for free having had sufficient time to consider the decision.  Where a child&rsquo;s parents have been cohabiting for 12 months and have not taken steps to appoint the father as a guardian, other provisions of the Bill will ensure he becomes a guardian automatically.  It is in the Bill that there is automatic guardianship once the couple have been cohabiting for 12 months.  That provision remains, and in the case of those couples, the father is automatically the guardian, including three months after the birth of the child.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 48 is to clarify for avoidance of any doubt that the period of cohabitation for the automatic acquisition of guardianship commences from the date on which the legislation comes into effect.  In general, legislation is not retrospective, and in view of the rights and responsibilities which accrue on guardianship, there must be clarity as to whether there is any intention of creating retrospective rights.  Fathers who live with their partners and children and who are not guardians can, if they wish, secure those rights and responsibilities sooner, whether by means of making a statutory declaration or the option of applying to the court, which is still available to parents in that situation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 56 makes the same clarification in respect of the automatic acquisition of guardianship by the cohabiting parent of a child born through donor-assisted human reproduction.  I have listened to the debate and moved to deal with certain issues.  This makes it far more likely that at the time of a birth, the natural father will assert his rights through the statutory declaration where a couple agrees with this and can do it when registering the birth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200016#O00100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426160400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 83, which inserts a new section 27A, reads &ldquo;a registrar may, during the period of 14 days immediately following the date on which the birth of a child is registered or re-registered, take and receive a statutory declaration&rdquo;.

We discussed this at length on Committee Stage and I appreciate that the Minister has put in an amendment to strengthen the area of statutory declarations.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious debate and organisations such as Treoir have been to the forefront in highlighting the issue.  There is inequality as between a father and a mother as things stand.  There must be thousands of fathers out there who did not realise when they registered their name on the child's birth certificate that it did not automatically entitle them to guardianship.  One third of children are born to mothers who are not married, many of whom are very young and even teenagers.  We always tell young men to step up to the plate, to be a father, be a man and pay their maintenance.  We tell them to be there for their child and to support their child, even if they are not going to continue in a relationship with the mother.  Without this legislation being enacted, we will not have equality as a father's right to guardianship is subject to the consent of the mother.  This makes it an unequal relationship.  When a man proudly registers his name, he will be advised that it confers no entitlement to guardianship and that he should seek the agreement of the mother to a statutory declaration.  If the mother disagrees, however, it will end up in court.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that this provides a measure of safety but we should devise a system where people do not go down the road of going to court on these matters.  The registrar should be able to give the necessary information from the get-go.  The fact that a father is there means he wants to be there and wants to fulfil his responsibilities.  It is unfortunate that, with so many men walking away from their responsibilities, when a man actually turns up to accept his responsibility and wants his name on the register he cannot have equality.<\/p>  <p>  The point is sometimes made that in many cases men are not really equal parents because they do not share the parenting responsibilities.  Then there are the cases of domestic abuse and where a man who is not really a fit father likes the idea of calling himself a father without what comes with it and it is for these cases that there is an option to go to court.  <\/p>  <p>  This Bill is very welcome and long overdue.  The difficulty is that until we have reform of family law, a mediation Bill and investment in the court system we will have the spectacle of separated parents in packed courtrooms across the State, with all the stress that goes with that.  We will not have equality between a father and a mother, particularly in cases where a father steps up to the plate.  I do not think conditionality in the form of residency - what I have called \"the co-habitance clause\" - is fair because sometimes a father cannot live with a mother.  The mother may live with her parents if she is very young, or maybe the father has to work away from home so cannot comply with the need to live with her for three months after the child is born and nine other months.  It is unfortunate we have that requirement and I cannot agree to it so I will press my amendment today.  I do not assume I will get support from the Minister today but as we develop these debates through future legislation we can revisit the issue and ensure the overall system gives as many guarantees and protections as possible for the father, the mother and, most important, the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200017#P00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1426161000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I realise there is not much time and I may come back to the subject at a later stage.  This is an extremely important debate and some issues that have been raised need a lot of debate.  The previous speaker said there was not equality between fathers and mothers.  He is dead right and we all know where most of the inequality lies.  It lies in the fact that one in five women is a victim of domestic violence.  One third of all parents are single parents, 90% of them mothers, and 50% of fathers do not pay any maintenance to those mothers.  It is on these matters that we need to legislate.<\/p>  <p>  How do we check if somebody has lived with somebody for 12 months?  It seems to be impossible to prove it.  Will a mother have the right to revoke guardianship based on the fact that it is automatic?  What about those women who are fleeing domestic violence and who may have lived with a violent man for a number of years?  I had a woman in my clinic on Monday morning in such a situation.  <\/p>  <p>  Custody is very clearly laid out in the law in front of us but a lot of people confuse custody with guardianship.  If a man wants to be a man and a father then custody and access are surely the key things he will want and he will be able to prove he is a father in that way.  However, the problem with guardianship is that a man who was violent towards his partner would still have the right to dictate where that woman lives because residency is part of guardianship.  He can prevent the children getting access to passports to leave the country.  There are major repercussions for women in those situations and there are quite a large number of such women.  <\/p>  <p>  Violence against women is at epidemic levels around the globe and it is understated in this country.  One in four women in Europe is a sufferer and I doubt more women are being abused in Europe than Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  How will the checks of the 12 year residency criteria be carried out?

There is an ongoing inquiry, for example, into child abuse in Northern Ireland.  We have had many inquiries here and many commissions of inquiry in the Republic.  One need only recall Cloyne, Ferns and Dublin, to give a number of examples.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone in this House was very clear in terms of condemning that abuse and in condemning anybody who would have been complicit in the cover up of that abuse.  I am particularly mindful of the very strong and strident comments of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  Back in 2009, which was a significant year, as we know now, in the context of the report of abuse in the Dublin diocese, she said that anyone, including garda&iacute;, found to be complicit in the cover-up of child abuse must be arrested and made to face the full rigours of the law.  She also made other significant comments on that occasion.  If one substituted the words \"Sinn F&eacute;in leadership\" or Sinn F&eacute;in authorities\" for the words \"the church\", \"garda&iacute;\" or \"others\", I wonder would people come to the same conclusion in terms of what should happen.<\/p>  <p>  Suffice to say that allegations were ignored across the board for too long and many people were emotionally scarred and traumatised as a result.  One of the big issues for many people in those abuse scandals was the fear of coming forward, the fear of being stigmatised and, above all, the fear of not being believed and being undermined by those who would have abused them.<\/p>  <p>  When the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill episode occurred we saw similar patterns emerging of attempts to undermine her credibility, and an online campaign was launched against her undermining her character and so on.  This week we have had the heartbreaking account of Paudie McGahon's story on the \"Spotlight\" programme on Tuesday night.  He gained the courage to tell his story, and Ma&iacute;ria Cahill telling her story was the trigger for him to go public on the issue.  Both of their actions have encouraged others to come forward.  Fundamentally, the people want justice and the truth.  It is very important that we be clear that there is a responsibility on all involved to obey the law and to respond to the legal requirements.  I was struck by the fact that on LMFM yesterday, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Adams, when asked whether it was not a breach of the Children First guidelines - whose aim is to protect children - not to report this, made an extraordinary comment to the effect that, first of all, in order for a statement to be made to the Garda, someone needs to substantiate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200018#Q00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1426161600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>A question, please, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200018#Q00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1426161600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>This is fundamentally not the case.

A representative from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre interviewed on radio this morning indicated that they have had an increased number of calls.  Therefore, it is vital that information is provided by anyone who has it.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that there are questions to be answered by Sinn F&eacute;in in regard to the information it has, particularly in regard to people who may be abroad in our society, whether in this country or elsewhere, and are a risk to children.  The Children First guidelines and all the various measures that have been implemented give clear guidance as to what should be done. <\/p>  <p>   I would also question Deputy Adams in particular regarding what he said - namely, that he needed more substantial information.  If a person has any concerns that children are at risk, then he or she should go to the Garda.  There are certainly questions to be answered.  There are particular questions as well about another matter.  As has been admitted, there were \"internal inquiries\", if I can use that nice phrase; \"kangaroo courts\" is another term that is used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200018#Q00700","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1426161600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Kangaroo courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200018#Q00800","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1426161600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>If there were such practices, are there people in Sinn F&eacute;in who have information as to who attended those courts, where they are now and what information is available in order to protect children?

The group was recently formed and has over 100,000 members currently.  They met a group of TDs and Senators yesterday to express their views on the continuing demise of rural Ireland and the need for Government policy to halt this downward slide.  They are highlighting the issues currently affecting the social and economic development of rural Ireland and they are seeking a change in Government policies in several issues pertaining to rural decline.  At the presentation to Oireachtas Members and to the media yesterday, the group reflected on many issues similar to those raised in Richard Curran's outstanding documentary programme on Monday night last on RTE1.  The programme, aptly titled \"The Battle for Rural Ireland,\" depicted the plight of rural areas and their fight to survive.  The group's representatives sense that the rural community has gone to the edge of the cliff.  They have got to the stage at which they are prepared to fight and resist being given the final push out over the cliff and into the abyss of no return.  That is the reality facing the countryside at present.<\/p>  <p>  Almost a decade of recession and recession policies and politics has taken a huge toll on these rural areas, and the group has identified a number of key issues which need immediate attention.  Will the Government address in what remains of its lifetime a number of these items that were brought before us yesterday?<\/p>  <p>  There is need for a regional spread in job creation.  At present, three quarters of all jobs are going into Dublin and other principal cities, and this cannot be allowed to continue.  The Government needs to accelerate the roll-out of broadband and ensure the viability of post offices and other services.  Some GP services in rural areas are being discontinued due to retirements, etc.  We need to get back our doctors from abroad and ensure there are services in remote rural areas.  There are several such cases at present.  The issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes is topical.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on what she has achieved in government in changing the system for school enrolment.  This would mean the retention of a significant number of teachers as well as the recruitment of a number of additional teachers.  I will give her credit; she has rural Ireland in her heart.

The Government has appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs, Deputy Ann Phelan.  She works across the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and is doing an effective job in raising these issues and giving them importance in government.  In fact, she attended Cabinet last week to discuss one of the issues about which Deputy Tom Fleming is concerned.<\/p><p> I thank the Deputy for his compliments concerning the issue of smaller schools.  We have a very good programme in place to alleviate the situation for schools that were at risk of losing teachers, recognising in particular isolated rural schools that are 8 km or more from the nearest school.  We have also been engaging with local communities where enrolment numbers are dropping.  This is an example of an action that Government has taken to address issues of serious concern in rural areas.  Another is the announcement of the Leader programme by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, in recent days.  Leader is an extremely important programme for rural Ireland.  The most recent announcements pertaining to the Action Plan for Jobs by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, also had a strong regional dimension.  The latest plan stresses the importance of ensuring that jobs are created in rural Ireland and in those parts of the country that have not benefited from the economic recovery that we are now seeing, particularly along the east coast and in Dublin.  The Department of Social Protection has ensured that post offices in general and rural post offices in particular are used to provide many of its services and payments to the public.

Several glaring deficiencies have been raised with Deputies representing rural Ireland, and there is a need for collective responsibility in Cabinet to address them.  Some of the issues I raised pertain to various Departments, and the Cabinet will have to wake up and focus on the areas that need to be addressed urgently.  In that context, I believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, is entitled to sit at the Cabinet table, as was done in the past with other Ministers of State.  I cannot recollect the details precisely but during the time of the so-called rainbow Government, a Minister of State was elevated to Cabinet.

I welcome the new Leader programme that has been introduced and I hope that the role of the partnerships will not be diluted.

As Deputy Fleming said in his opening remarks, job creation is crucial in rural Ireland.  We need to build on the strengths of different parts of the country to provide jobs for people near their homes.  Having two Ministers from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the Cabinet table is significant.

She should stand back from the issue and engage with the teaching profession on the issue of independent assessment and the best methodology to use to develop the talents and intelligence of young people.  That is an important issue which is being lost because of how this debate has been conducted over the past two years.  There is the issue of the lack of independent assessment, and we must be clear about that.  By visiting rural schools, one can see how closely knit communities are, which raises substantial issues that are being dismissed too readily.  Teachers have a valid point on this issue because the one good thing about our State examination system is that, irrespective of background, students get fair treatment.  It is one of the few systems in the country about which we can say that influence or knowing someone in the parish, the golf club, the GAA club, the rugby club and so forth will have no impact on the outcome or result.  There are legitimate and substantive issues.  There are also legitimate issues about how we teach and learn.<\/p><p>I accept that.  There have been reforms through the years, such as different forms of the leaving certificate, namely the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational.  I would like to know when the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be published.  It would be good if people stood back from all this because it is not going go anywhere the way it is being handled.  Ramming it through will not be effective because curricular change ultimately needs the full engagement and participation of stakeholders.  The key dynamic in the classroom is the one between the teacher and the child which is central to the successful roll-out of change.<\/p> <p> My second question relates to the proposed education Bill.  Recent parliamentary replies have suggested that the concept of an independent ex quota provision for careers guidance counselling will never return to schools.  The Minister has said that more or less in parliamentary replies to my colleague.  Is this the position and is careers guidance something that will never return to the classroom to the degree and scale that pertained before the Government's decision to abolish ex quota careers guidance counsellors, which removed 1,000 teachers from the system?  Deputy McConalogue has been persistent in pursuing this issue with the Minister for the past year or more and the responses have become more alarming in the sense of it being all about the school community but with no additional resources being given.

In respect of the junior cycle, which is not part of that Bill, I have had 40 hours of discussions with teaching unions.  An independent chairperson whose name was proposed by the unions put forward what he considered to be fair proposals and the unions have still withdrawn from consideration.  I believe we need this reform.  While the Deputy says we have a fair system, it is fair at assessing what a person can write in a written examination at the end of three years but it is not fair to all students because it does not assess a variety of strengths that young people have nowadays.  I also have a duty to the other partners in education such as the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, the National Parents Council and the management bodies who want us to move forward with this reform.<\/p>  <p>  The particular concern I have with the Deputy's contribution is that he seems to be suggesting that teachers are so unprofessional that they would not be able to carry out this assessment without being intimidated into making decisions that are not in the best interests of students.  I very much respect and value the professionalism of teachers, as does the rest of the country.  They are held in very high regard.  This reform has been proposed for a long time and we need to move it forward in the interests of all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned resources for careers guidance, referred to my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, and suggested that he handled this badly.

Its intention is to rectify a defect in the Multi-Unit Developments Act.  I spoke at length to the previous Minister for Justice and Equality about the difficulty with said Act.  At least one local authority, if not more, has been asked for its view on the matter.  The difficulty concerns the definition of a multi-unit development.  The flaw in the legislation means that any development of more than five houses is deemed to be a multi-unit development, which imposes on it a requirement to introduce a management company.  That is the way local authorities are interpreting the legislation.  Instead of resolving issue, the legislation is posing new difficulties.  The issue is a simple one and relates to definition.  Essentially, the Bill seeks that a structure requiring a management company would be a multi-unit development with one roof over it.  I got a solicitor to help me to draft the wording and I hope it is sufficiently robust.<\/p><p>Management companies have been a very difficult issue for people to resolve.  Prior to the crash, when people arrived at a solicitor's office to get the keys of their new home, they were told to sign for them and were advised that it was just a matter of form.  They then discovered that they were part of a management company that placed an annual financial obligation on them.  I do not refer to situations where a management company is required but to traditional housing developments.  Management companies are very difficult to unwind as they are framed according to company law, which gives rise to difficulty when a local authority takes an estate in charge.  Many local authorities are concerned that only one entity would be involved in the management of the estate, which means the management company must be wound down.<\/p><p>I recently published a booklet to help people to unpick the issue as it is a complex area.  I would prefer not to introduce the Bill.  I would prefer if the change could be made by way of amendment to the legislation as a matter of urgency.  The very least we should do is not to make things difficult for people.  Local authorities are starting to get new development proposals and new planning applications are being made to them.  The difficulty is that the planning applications will have a requirement for a management company when there is no need for one.  This will cause considerable administrative problems in the future, which will result in needless extra expense.  It is a relatively simple matter to ensure that does not happen.  I hope the Government will address the issue in advance of the Bill even having an airing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200024#W03000","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1426165200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200024#W03100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1426165200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200024#W03200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426165200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426165200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200024#W03400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1426165200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200024#W03500","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426165200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Road Traffic (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2015: First Stage","time":1426165200,"counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200024#W03700"},{"type":"speech","time":1426165200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Road Traffic Act 1961 to provide for dual language road signs and related matters.<\/blockquote>T&aacute; pr&aacute;inn uaf&aacute;sach ag titim amach os &aacute;r gcomhair maidir leis an teanga.

This agency, to be known as the fuel smuggling forum, would bring together all the statutory agencies for detecting and policing the illicit fuel trade, North and South.<\/p><p>Fuel smuggling and the criminal activity which runs in tandem with it is a cancer affecting many areas along the Border.  It impacts negatively on communities, North and South, posing not only an environmental threat, but also a severe criminal one by strengthening the dangerous and violent elements which are involved with this illegal trade.  I commend the work of the investigative journalists who have clearly identified paramilitaries, among others, as being involved in this trade.<\/p><p>The environmental consequences of fuel laundering have been widely reported in areas along the Border.  The material produced as a consequence of removing green dye from diesel is highly toxic and has the potential to damage public drinking water supplies.  The fuel laundering industry also spawns broader criminality such as illicit cigarette smuggling and trade in other counterfeit products.  <\/p><p>The Bill builds on the work of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I commend the work of the assembly's committee which produced an important report on this issue.  The report's recommendations include the imposition of more serious penalties, including lengthier custodial sentences for illicit activities, on the individuals and gangs involved in these criminal activities.<\/p><p>The fuel smuggling forum to be established through this legislation would consist of a director general and seven other officers appointed in accordance with the legislation.  Three officers would be appointed to the forum by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and would consist of an officer each from the Environmental Protection Agency and Office of the Revenue Commissioners and a chief superintendent nominated by the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister, in consultation with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, would also be enabled to appoint the following to be officers of the forum: an officer each from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and revenue service, a chief superintendent from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and an officer from the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. <\/p><p>The forum, in carrying out its work, would be provided with the relevant information by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  This information would pertain to fuel smuggling and other organised criminal activity in the Border region.  It is proposed that the forum, within six months after the end of the preceding year, would prepare an annual report specifying its activities and submit same to the Minister.  The director general would be required to attend a meeting of the joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas whenever asked to do so by the committee and to provide relevant information.<\/p><p>As a representative of two Southern Border counties, I am particularly conscious of the criminal activity involved in fuel smuggling and other illicit trade.  The proposal I put before the House is to ensure these issues are dealt with comprehensively.  They can only be solved through more effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law.  Bringing together in one forum or body the statutory agencies whose remit is to deal with these activities is clearly the way forward in dealing with a problem that has grown significantly in recent years.<\/p><p>We are all well aware of the large volumes of laundered diesel and, in more recent times, stretched petrol that are being traded much further afield than the Border region.  The many negative aspects to these activities include a substantial loss of revenue to the State and a similar loss in Northern Ireland.  It was recently estimated that upwards of &euro;260 million is lost to the State annually through illegal fuel smuggling.  Small traders also have a genuine grievance because their business is being eroded through illicit trade.  Individual motorists also incur substantial costs when, in good faith, they purchase product without knowing it has been contaminated, resulting in high repair costs for engines and other vehicle parts.<\/p><p>On many Border roads, in particular, we witness fuel spillages which create hazards for motorists and may have caused many accidents over the years.  Local authorities incur substantial expenditure every year cleaning up these spillages.  We must also consider the overall damage to the environment caused by fuel laundering.  We have all seen, either in person or in photographs, cubes of sludge dumped by roadsides and in ditches.  This sludge is a by-product of the bleaching agents and sulphuric acid used in laundering diesel.  The outcome of this process is that toxic waste is dumped in our countryside, posing serious dangers to our waterways, public drinking water supplies and public health in general and threatens the provenance and authenticity of our agricultural production system.<\/p><p>We need the new cross-Border multi-agency task force I propose to deal in the most comprehensive manner possible with the scourge that is being inflicted on so many communities, one which has impacted on the lives of genuine traders and innocent motorists and continues to rob the State of much-needed revenue.  Our response to these despicable activities must be enhanced to rid society of this illicit trade and deny the criminals involved their ill-gotten gains.

I accept that it is a first step and that the Minister has listened to some of the comments on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is not good enough, however, that the Minister does not go further in this regard.  This legislation is extensive and complex.  It goes to incredible lengths to provide for protection for people who find themselves in situations where, for all kinds of different reasons, they are parents of children.  The Bill goes out of its way to confer rights on people in all kinds of situations where the State deems a person to be the parent of a child.  To some extent, the Bill could be criticised for bringing about a situation where parents will now be whoever the State decides they are.  It raises all kinds of other issues which, unfortunately, we have not had time to delve into or discuss.<\/p>  <p>  One glaring omission of this Bill relates to where there is no question about the genetic parentage of a child in respect of the father and where both parents are agreed on the matter.  It is undoubtedly the case that good public policy would provide for automatic guardianship in those situations.  In fact, one would have to ask why it is that the State would not provide for automatic guardianship in those situations.  Whatever about historical situations, I cannot understand how such a provision in legislation in 2015 would not be open to contest in the courts because of refusing or failing to provide for automatic guardianship in these circumstances.  I do not understand why the Minister is not prepared to address that.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the Minister has been quite disingenuous, as have others as well, in raising the issue of domestic violence as some kind of defence for not providing for automatic guardianship for unmarried fathers.  Regrettably, domestic violence is all too common in this country, but it is certainly not the preserve of unmarried fathers.  It is wrong for the issue to be raised in that context.  Clearly, there are several situations or circumstances in which a father or mother may not be the best person to have guardianship of a particular child.  However, those decisions should be taken elsewhere case by case basis and not on the basis of someone's marital status.  Again, I am unsure how this could possibly stand up to any kind of legal challenge.<\/p>  <p>  On what basis is the Minister suggesting that simply because a father of a child is married he has automatic rights, whereas the father of a child who is not married does not enjoy those rights?  It seems to be fundamental that someone in that situation, a person who is the father or the mother of a child, should have automatic guardianship rights, unless it is one of those rare circumstances where that is not in the child's best interests.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning all of this must be those fundamental rights, as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides for every child to know and be cared for, as far as practicable, by both parents.  If we subscribe to the UN Convention, as I assume the Minister does, then what on earth can the rationale be for denying automatic guardianship to unmarried fathers?  I simply do not understand it.<\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say to us in 2015 that we have taken the first step and that we will see about the other steps later.  That is simply not acceptable.  The Minister is providing for all kinds of other situations, including setting down the legal parameters of parentage in many different unusual and new circumstances, whereas she fails to address this issue.  It has been with us for a long time and the Minister knows it has been an issue for a long time.  Despite this, the Minister is not taking the opportunity of this legislation to deal with that.<\/p>  <p>  This is not only about the right of the child; it is about the rights and responsibilities of fathers.  We see too often unmarried fathers being blacklisted or dismissed as not important in their children's lives.  Negative messages come out at an official level about unmarried fathers, and that needs to be changed urgently.  It is the case that where we expect a lot from someone, they tend to give a lot, but if we expect little from people, they will give little.  There is an official attitude to unmarried fathers to the effect that they are not important, that they should not be around, that they are not necessary and so on.  That type of negative attitude is very much reinforced through our social welfare and tax legislation as well as social policy in other areas.  There are fundamental issues around the rights of the child but also around the rights of fathers which are not being catered for in this legislation.  That is a serious omission.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to explain the basis on which she is discriminating between fathers who are married and fathers who happen to be unmarried.  In effect, that is what the Minister is doing.  I call on the Minister to provide justification for that, because I do not believe there is any justification, and, if not, I urge the Minister to address this matter comprehensively in the legislation.  The Minister knows it will be a considerable time before the Government revisits this area of family law.  The Minister should not leave a glaring omission.<\/p>  <p>  Other aspects of what the Minister proposes require more exploration, for example, the question of establishing guardianship.  I am unsure why the Minister has amended the Bill to make it operative from the date of the passage of this legislation.  If it is good practice that certain rules should relate to guardianship, then I do not see why children who were born last month or last year cannot enjoy whatever limited benefits have been conveyed by this Bill.<\/p><p> I also ask the Minister to explain why she came up with this figure of 12 months.  On what basis does 12 months convey rights of paternity?  I would also ask her to explain how it will be possible to establish that there has been cohabitation for 12 months.  She referred to amendment No. 83, but that does not go anywhere near far enough, in my view, and while it is a start, it is not adequate.  Why does the Minister not provide for the registrar to be required to inform fathers about their rights in regard to making a declaration?  It would have been very easy to state that the registrar \"shall\" inform fathers of their entitlement to make a statutory declaration.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not done that.<\/p> <p> The Bill states that the registrar may take and receive a statutory declaration.  How does a registrar receive a statutory declaration?  Is the Minister suggesting that the registrar will be given a statutory declaration?  What does the registrar then do with it?  Does he or she lodge it somewhere?  Is any record of that kept anywhere?  It would seem from the Minister's earlier comments that she does not intend to do that.<\/p> <p> The Minister in this legislation goes to considerable lengths to provide for the additional information that will be added to a birth certificate where a person was born as a result of assisted human reproduction, and to outline how all of that is going to be worked out.  If there are registers for that kind of information, why on earth would we not provide for a register for statutory declarations in regard to guardianship?  That just seems to be standard good practice.  The Minister mentioned something about the difficulties involved.  I cannot understand how there could be difficulties.  It is a straightforward thing.  A legal document is declared, yet no record of it is kept.  Will the Minister explain to us why she is not providing for a record?  It is very disappointing that the Minister has not paid heed to the representations that have been made to her in this regard.  I believe she is leaving the State open to a legal challenge by not doing that, but, more importantly, she is leaving children of unmarried parents in that legal limbo where a child's right to know and be cared for by both parents is not actually being upheld by the State.  Equally, she is providing for a situation in which fathers, in cases in which paternity is not in dispute and the man is the undisputed genetic father of a child, are being denied the rights and responsibilities of good fathers simply on the basis that they have not cohabited with their partners.  I cannot see any logic in that provision and I cannot see how it could possibly stand up to any kind of challenge.<\/p> <p> I would be very interested in hearing the Minister's explanation on all of those questions.  Hopefully, we can get some kind of commitment that she might address this lacuna in the law when the Bill gets to the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200026#Y01400","speaker":"1178","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426167000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I also raised this issue on Second Stage.  Obviously, my comments come in the context of general support for this Bill, which is a very welcome Bill that acknowledges the reality of diverse family relations in our society today.  However, the issue of unmarried fathers having to pass a criterion of having lived with the mother for 12 consecutive months, including for three months after the birth of the child, is very arbitrary and does not make any particular sense.  While I apologise for not having been here earlier, I would be most interested to hear the Minister's justification for this.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, there are circumstances involving a father from whom the mother of the child is separated, or with whom she never had any long-term relationship, where the mother may believe there are reasons he should not have automatic guardianship, and I certainly think we have to allow for that in some way.  However, on the other hand, in the vast majority of cases fathers and mothers, married or unmarried - the parents - want to play a full part in bringing up their kids.  I do not believe we should start from a presumption that any category of parent has to have extra hoops to jump through in order to benefit from automatic guardianship.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister needs to put in safeguards which allow a mother to debar a father whom she thinks might be, for example, a threat to a child or to herself from having guardianship, then such provisions obviously need to exist and may be spelt out explicitly.  Obviously, people can go to the courts, and the best interests of the child are firmly established in the Bill.  However, I do not see why the Minister has this particular category and these fairly arbitrary criteria when, probably in the majority of cases, there is no difficulty with an unmarried father who does not happen to fit these criteria having automatic guardianship.  I say that as an unmarried father myself.  I think I would probably just about fit these criteria, so I think I would pass.  However, a person could be on the borderline.  It is very arbitrary.  I would like to hear the Minister's response and I hope she will be open-minded in how she deals with this when it moves to the Seanad in order to take on board these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200027#Z00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1426167000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>First, I want to apologise for any confusion I caused earlier.  I had picked up the Committee Stage amendments by accident - <i>mea culpa<\/i>.<\/p><p>I very much agree with the points made by Deputies Shortall, Boyd Barrett and Mac Lochlainn.  What I would say that is a little different is that I accept progress is being made in this legislation in that more unmarried fathers will qualify for guardianship than would otherwise have qualified if the legislation had not been passed, which is welcome.  I also welcome the changes the Minister is making through amendment No. 83, which is very significant and on which I will have questions later.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, this is still very discriminatory.  Our law as it stands is very discriminatory, and this continues in that mould.  It is particularly discriminatory against younger fathers.  The idea that 19 year old parents would have to live together is just not the reality of the situation.  Very often a family decision is made, including the grandparents, that the parents will not live together and that they will continue with their education, for example.  Another point is that younger people are more vulnerable, more impressionable and more influenced by what their parents might decide for them.<\/p><p>In that regard, I was watching a programme last night in which people are helped to trace their parents who gave them up for adoption.  There was a case in which a woman of 46 met her father for the first time.  Basically, when he was 20 he was not really given any option to keep his child and the decision was very much taken for him and the mother of the child.  We are very much perpetuating that treatment of young unmarried fathers with this legislation.<\/p><p>Another point is the societal problems that have been identified.<\/p><p>Young unmarried fathers are pushed away for many different reasons, including cultural reasons, the way our social welfare system operates and so on.<\/p> <p> The idea that unmarried fathers would have to live with mothers is a very morally judgmental way of approaching the issue.  It is not applied to any other type of parent or guardian in current legislation or the Bill.  To say that a father must live with the mother for a certain period of time is a moral standpoint.  I have problems with that.<\/p> <p> The Law Reform Commission recommended going much further than this Bill and, with some qualifications, giving automatic guardianship to unmarried fathers.  That has been done in other countries.  I am aware of jurisdictions where if a father is registered on a child's birth certificate, he gets automatic guardianship rights.  That is what the Bill should state.  <\/p> <p> Court cases, including at EU level, have highlighted injustices over the years, such as the fact that unmarried fathers have not been consulted about adoption.  It is one of the rights and responsibilities that comes with guardianship, which is delineated in an amendment proposed by the Minister.  The fact that an unmarried father would not be consulted on an adoption because he does not have guardianship status is a very significant problem.  <\/p> <p> I understand from what Deputy Boyd Barrett said that this is not retrospective.  The Minister said one of the amendments is to make the criteria about living with the mother for 12 consecutive months clear.  It does not apply retrospectively.  For example, the law will not change the situation pertaining to an unmarried father who has lived with a mother for 20 years.  There are no new options in the Bill for such unmarried fathers.  What is being done for such people?  There are men who may have lived with mothers for a long period of time, but no longer do so.  If the Bill is not retrospective, how will such men be catered for?  What advice did the Minister receive?  Was it that the Bill cannot be retrospective?  Can anything be done retrospectively for people who will not get the benefits of this Bill?  <\/p> <p> I refer to Deputy Coppinger's points.  She spoke about domestic violence, which is to tar everyone with the same brush.  Most people are not violent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200027#Z00300","speaker":"1010","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426167600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I said it was one in five.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200028#AA00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1426167600,"counter":470,"content":"<p>The majority are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200028#AA00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1426167600,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I did not say it was the majority.

I am not aware of any such evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Many other types of guardians, other than parents, are mentioned in the Bill.  The same criteria being applied to unmarried fathers is not being applied to them.  Certain criteria are being applied because of marital status, something with which I have a problem.  <\/p>  <p>  I asked whether the Bill could be retrospective and what was being done for people who will not receive retrospective recognition.  I welcome amendment No. 83.  If a registrar receives declarations, will he or she be able to keep them?  Will they be recorded in any way?  How will such records be kept?  I see no provision for such things in the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall made a good point.  The discourse in society is about equality, which is very welcome, but not if one is an unmarried father.  In such cases, equality is not even being argued for, apart from individuals in the Chamber and those outside who are very much in the minority.  The issue is not, as far as I can see, being debated in the media.  There is one group we seem to think against which it is fine to discriminate, namely, unmarried fathers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200028#AA00500","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1426167600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions on this topic, which was a key part of the discussion on Second Stage.  As I said, I have taken action in a number of the amendments I tabled to make it easier for fathers to get information on the statutory declaration which is, in effect, the mechanism by which non-marital fathers can assert their guardianship rights at the current time.  We know that many do not.<\/p>  <p>  Constitutional protection for the family refers to a family based on marriage.  To some degree, the provisions of the Bill reflect the existing constitutional protection for marital fathers and are the consequence of legal advice.  Equally, we are discussing statutory declarations, which I accept.<\/p>  <p>  The complexities of this debate are illustrated by the comments of Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Coppinger on automatic guardianship for fathers, which captured some of the issues in the Bill.  Where a father has ongoing and real involvement in his child's life, it is very important to ensure he can be the child's guardian.  That is why the Bill already extends automatic guardianship to fathers living in a family unit with the child's mother and the child. <\/p>  <p>  I am also ensuring that information is more readily available to parents and it will be much easier to make statutory declarations, appointing the father as a guardian.

I do not agree that a father should have to live with a mother to gain guardianship.  The law does not state that.  I do not agree with the provision and I have raised questions about it because it is arbitrary and gives extra rights to somebody who lived with a woman, but that does not mean he is a suitable father.  My problem is with a whole raft of Deputies arguing that there should be automatic guardianship in every case.<\/p><p>I do not agree with that, and I will explain why.  Any father can make a statutory declaration that he is a guardian, and he does not have to live with somebody for a year to do so.  It has been proposed by some Deputies that extra rights are earned if a person lives with a partner for a year, but that is not true.  The Minister has indicated that she will make the statutory declaration a bigger issue, and I agree with Deputies that this has not been discussed enough.  There are many people in this position, so it should have been debated more, and it is a little disappointing that the media have not taken more of an interest.<\/p> <p> I have never said that somebody who is unmarried is more likely to commit domestic violence.  I made the point that just because a person has lived with a woman for a year, there should not be an automatic right to guardianship.  Many of the one in five women who, according to Women's Aid, experience domestic violence in this country will now be put in a very difficult position because the man who abused them, and possibly their children, will have guardianship.  We put down amendments, which unfortunately were ruled out of order.  There should be conditions relating to guardianship.  For example, Women's Aid called for a rebuttal presumption to be introduced relating to custody, and the same goes for guardianship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200028#AA02200","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426168200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The Deputy will have to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200029#BB00200","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I was speaking before the break for Leaders' Questions but I was cut off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200029#BB00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time for this session is concluded.

As far as I can see, the Bill or the amendments do not provide for information to be made available, and that is why I have suggested an amendment that the registrar of births \"shall be required to inform\" people of their rights to make a statutory declaration.  There is woolly stuff there about information being made available, and this needs to be set down in law.

That is a major problem, which was a feature of a recent legal case in which somebody with no blood relationship with the child ended up having superior rights to the genetic father of the child.

There is a distinction being made between married and unmarried fathers, with one seen as automatically suitable for guardianship while the other is not.  That does not make any sense and is completely arbitrary.

The issue is definitely evolving, as we can see from the approach I have taken in the Bill to extend automatic rights to unmarried fathers where they have been living with the mother for a time.  There were a number of questions concerning cohabitation.  The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act contains a definition of cohabitation.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is normally understood as a committed and intimate relationship.  It will be for the court to determine and have evidence on cohabitation.  Courts are adept at looking for the kind of information that a couple could present in that respect.  That would only come up if the situation was contested between the couple who are living together, because it is automatic if they are living together after 12 months.  If a disagreement arose subsequently and if the father said he had lived there for 12 months, including for three months after the birth of the child, there is a definition of cohabitation in the civil partnership Act, but it is also up to the court to examine that and look for the evidence it would need to prove cohabitation.  That would not be a major issue.<\/p> <p> I pointed out the various elements in this debate.  We have just heard an argument, and Deputy Boyd Barrett said it too, that there should be exceptions - that it should not necessarily be automatic.  It is automatic for marital fathers, and the mother has the rights by virtue of giving birth.  There is constitutional protection for the married mother and father.  One could not take that away, nor would one want to, although it can happen through a court dispute about access and custody, separation or divorce.  The Bill reflects existing constitutional protections for marital fathers.  We are moving towards giving greater rights to non-marital fathers.  Where a father has ongoing and real involvement, we are making it very easy with the statutory declaration.  The information is given much more readily than it was before.  It is interesting, as Deputies say, that there has not been much discussion of this.  It is surprising, given the importance of the father&rsquo;s role, marital or non-marital, in a child&rsquo;s life.  I am surprised at the number of men who do not realise that by getting a statutory declaration signed they get full guardianship rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200029#BB02000","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Nobody tells them that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00200","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Why does the Minister not require the registrar to tell them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00400","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>That is precisely why I am dealing with this issue and working with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that information is given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Presumably they would know if they wanted to know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00600","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I am not putting it into legislation, but it will be done by way of administrative response from the Department of Social Protection.

All new parents find out about that and register their children.  We will ensure that the information about the statutory declaration is made available, and I have a commitment from the Department of Social Protection that it will become involved in making sure the information is provided.  That is a big change and it arose from the discussion here and the contributions of Deputies Collins and Mac Lochlainn about the need to create far more awareness of the rights of the father and how the father can guarantee them.  Once there is agreement with the mother, the statutory declaration is open.  Many fathers do not fill out that form.  It is a relatively simple declaration to make before a peace commissioner or commissioner for oaths.  We are dealing with the information issues on that.<\/p>  <p>  The question of maintaining the records was raised.  It is a very interesting one.  We do not have a record of guardians in this country.  This has not just arisen in the context of this Bill.  Guardianship decisions are taken in the courts all the time.  Many fathers go directly to court when there is disagreement with the mother to get their guardianship rights asserted.  The courts refuse between 5% and 10% on the basis that it is not considered to be in the child&rsquo;s best interests, including with regard to the range of issues we have touched on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00700","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>What is the percentage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1426168800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Between 5% and 10%.  That is where the mother disagrees, but the majority of applications are granted.  That is an estimate.  It is hard to get that figure.  For decades courts have made decisions on guardianship, and it is up to the person, just as in the case of a will, to take possession of what we might call the guardianship certificate.  Solicitors may have a copy but there is no repository as such.<\/p>  <p>  We are being asked to begin to keep an automatic record, a register of guardianship.  In principle that is the right thing to do, but it is quite complex.  The records have to be gathered from every court in the land.  The Courts Service has to work out how that will be done.  A process has to be put in place.  There has to be a decision on the shape of such a register, where it will be held, the combination of national and local records and the information technology systems that record or do not record them.  This is a large piece of work. <\/p>  <p>  Treoir makes the point that we keep records of many things in this country but there are many contracts that we do not keep records of.  This is a very important aspect of a child's and a family&rsquo;s life.  I am suggesting in amendment No. 60 that I would begin the process of moving towards that by having two pilot projects to work with organisations, such as Treoir and Women&rsquo;s Aid, which have a point of view on this to see how we can put together a policy approach and a recommendation on how to move forward.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Shortall that the role of the registrar is being developed and there will be administrative arrangements and probably regulations from the Department of Social Protection about developing this.  That would be in line with the way information is provided on a variety of rights.  That is a major move under this legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Several Deputies spoke about the broader context in respect of how a court deals with these issues.  We need family courts to take these decisions.  I will bring forward legislation to establish family courts.  We received advice that establishing family courts would require a constitutional amendment.  I have now decided to move ahead with establishing a family court in each division of the courts, where there would be judges who specialised in this area and more time to hold complex family law cases.  There is also a need to develop mediation services further.  We do not have enough.  There will be a mediation Bill.  Both of these will substantially help the situation. <\/p>  <p>  Several points were made about cohabitation for 12 months, including for three months after the birth of the child.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and I changed the provision based on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.<\/p><p>The approach in the Bill is to require a committed relationship, with a couple living together for three months after the birth of the child.  That is a move towards automatic guardianship for couples in those situations.  Many will be in such a situation and will be able to avail of automatic guardianship as a result.<\/p> <p> Deputy Tuffy asked about retrospection.  Where a couple has lived together for a number of years, the father is immediately entitled to seek a statutory declaration.  If the couple lives together and there is no objection, as would be the case in the circumstances to which the Deputy referred, the father gets full guardianship rights.  As a result of this Bill, the father in such a position will have automatic rights within a year.<\/p> <p> Some Deputies asked about automatic rights for all fathers and referred to the different treatment of non-marital fathers in this country.  Some of that arises from the constitutional position but there are issues to be worked on around automatic guardianship.  Those issues include cases where there is no real involvement in the child's life, where the father is not around or where the father fails to exercise his guardianship responsibilities, as Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned.  In such circumstances there are real consequences for the mother and the child.  For example, the mother would have to apply to the court to dispense with the consent of the father for the issue of a passport.  While it is a rare case, it would also apply where a lone parent decided to place a child for adoption.<\/p> <p> We have spoken about domestic violence and abuse and I agree that we should not make a decision as to the rights of a non-marital father on the basis of the poor behaviour of some other people.  There is further policy work to be done to enable us to deal with the exceptions in legislation.  I have given a commitment to a review of the legislation in two years and, in the meantime, work will go ahead on the various policy issues on which Deputies have commented.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies said that other countries have moved to automatic guardianship.  That is true but there exists a variety of meanings for the word \"automatic\" in this context and it does not always mean one can go from one situation to another.  A range of considerations has been taken into account in the legislation in those countries and we would need to do likewise.  I will do further work on this issue but I believe the provisions in the Bill will substantially change the number of fathers who will automatically be guardians.  They will now know that they can become guardians by signing a statutory declaration and the situation regarding the rights of natural fathers will be much improved.<\/p> <p> One Deputy stated that parents will now be whoever the State says they will be.  I reject that comment.  Parents continue to be the biological parents except in the very limited and highly specific circumstances of donor-assisted reproduction, which is subject to massive safeguards in the child's best interest.  The golden thread running through this legislation is the child's best interest.  We have to begin to legislate for AHR and DAR, and the way we have approached these issues in the legislation is extremely respectful towards biological parents.  It takes full cognisance of their rights and makes every effort to ensure that the right of the child to genetic information is fully respected.  Some 300,000 people in this country are affected by infertility issues and it was important to deal with parentage issues arising in cases of AHR or DAR.  I reject the characterisation of the Bill as one in which parents are to be whoever the State says they are.  We are building in extra protections for children and families in order that we can have more stable family units where the parents who actually rear the children will have guardianship rights and this will be in the interests of the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200030#CC00900","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426169400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426169400,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 47:<blockquote>In page 37, lines 14 to 18, to delete all words from and including &quot;, and&quot; in line 14 down to and including &quot;child&quot; in line 18.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200031#DD00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"vote","time":1426169700,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 33; N\u00edl, 49.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn and R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall; N\u00edl, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Joe Carey.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200032#EE00200","aye":["1066","1190","1071","1193","1057","1037","1192","959","1107","1022","1047","1198","1050","960","983","945","998","999","1017","1090","1183","1177","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","953","1178","970","1102","1065","956"],"nay":["1062","980","1079","989","1029","1042","975","1195","1099","1006","986","994","968","1075","1011","1103","957","1014","1009","1051","995","1106","949","1012","1021","1110","1053","1023","1180","1194","1000","997","1038","1026","1070","1034","1197","1056","1060","1058","1073","971","1063","966","947","1013","961","978","1010"]},{"type":"speech","time":1426170000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 48:<blockquote>In page 37, line 15, to delete &ldquo;months,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;months occurring after the date on which this subsection comes into operation,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200033#FF00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426170000,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426170000,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 49 is in the names of Deputies Coppinger, Murphy and Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200033#FF00400","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1426170000,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thought that was ruled out of order.

I thought it had been ruled out of order.  I move amendment No. 49:<blockquote>In page 37, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann 12 months following the enactment of this Act on the impact of the changes to guardianship outlined in this section, and in the drafting of the report to consult with groups and organisations concerned with the welfare and safety of children and women.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>This amendment ties up some of the issues that arose in the earlier discussion about putting safeguards in place with regard to automatic guardianship.  We want the Minister - say, in 12 months - to examine this and consult with groups and organisations concerned with the welfare and safety of children and women about the very important minority of situations in which women experience domestic violence.  We mentioned earlier that one in five women experience this.  In 2012, 12,000 barring orders were granted.  On one day, for example, 217 women and 152 children were accommodated in refuges.  From 2000 to 2005, garda&iacute; responded to 15 to 30 incidents of domestic violence a day.<\/p><p>There has been a denial that this is a serious issue for a cohort of women in this country, but it is ludicrous to then say that this is being applied to all men; it is not.  It is a cohort of women and their children, and some safeguards should be attached to automatic guardianship.<\/p><p>In terms of the other situations that can arise, some Deputies mentioned examples such as that of a young girl who might become pregnant in a situation in which the father, understandably, cannot live with her.  Such fathers should have rights, and I hope that will be the case.  However, most lone parents are not young girls.  They are women with a number of children whose relationships have broken down or whatever.  We all know teenagers or young girls who became pregnant who did not have a meaningful relationship with the father of the child.  We would not agree that that father should necessarily have automatic guardianship.  Are we saying that teenagers who make a mistake in their lives should be stuck with gobdaws for the rest of their lives who will have control over their passports?<\/p><p>Listening to some Deputies in the House, one would think there are women who are knowingly and deliberately preventing fathers from having constructive, meaningful relationships with their children.  The evidence would suggest otherwise.  I cannot think of any woman who would prevent somebody having a relationship with their child, or guardianship, if he was playing a positive role.  However, 90% of lone parents are women, and two thirds of those lone parents are living in poverty because in many cases they are not getting financial help from the fathers of their children.  The Growing Up in Ireland survey completed in 2013 found that 50% of fathers make no financial contribution to the maintenance of their child.  While I agree that we want fathers to play a positive role with mothers, there are cases in which men are not stepping up to the plate and are not willing to support their children financially, emotionally or in other ways.<\/p><p>The purpose of my amendment is to include safeguards with respect to guardianship to ensure it is not granted automatically and to provide that organisations such as Women's Aid and other groups who deal with families who are victims of domestic violence will be consulted in 12 months' time to determine whether there has been a negative impact for women and their children arising from the granting of automatic guardianship.  <\/p><p>It is ironic that Deputies who trooped in here and voted down a Bill to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution, which would have allowed women more control over their own fertility, are now lining up to support fathers' rights without giving any recognition to the fact that women are being left in this position.  By the way, I do not agree that women should be left in control of children.  There should be a shared arrangement but, unfortunately, we do not live in that type of society.  It seems that many women are not living with the fathers of their children, presumably for a reason, and these men can and should apply for custody and for shared parentage.  That facility is written into the Bill.  My quibble related to the automatic granting of guardianship, which allows men control over matters such as passports and where the woman lives.  <\/p><p>A woman who is staying in the women's refuge in Blanchardstown came into my clinic on Monday.  She has a good profession but has not been able to work for two years because of her husband's violence and his sexual violence against the children.  When we discussed this Bill, that woman was horrified to think that because she lived for a period with the father he would automatically have guardianship of those children and she would then have to go to court to prevent him from having that guardianship.  My amendment proposes that safeguards be attached to the granting of guardianship, and I believe everybody should agree with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200033#FF00700","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1426170600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>On the example Deputy Coppinger cited of the woman's husband, she stated the woman was shocked to find that a Bill would give him automatic guardianship.

I briefly worked as a solicitor and when I was an apprentice, I worked on some family law.  The system is a real obstacle for some unmarried fathers who would be good parents.  It is an obstacle to go to the court.  It puts a barrier in place that is difficult to overcome.  There is prejudice.  For example, there will be situations where in the case of a young couple with a child, the mother's parents think the father is a waster and the less the young mother has to do with him, the better.

It is not only about the rights of mothers or fathers but also the right of children to know both their parents because many studies show that fathers and mothers are important to children.  That is why it is important that we, as a Legislature, uphold the rights of children to know and be cared for to the greatest extent possible by both their parents.  That is why some of us made the point that it is wrong to discriminate against fathers simply because they are not married to the mother of their child.  I still hold that view.

The Minister should take it on board.  If we can get this right for the Seanad, the Minister should be open-minded about it.<\/p>  <p>  There are two conflicting perspectives which need to be reconciled.  First, Deputy Coppinger raises the legitimate concern as to why, in a situation where the parents do not live together and where they no longer have a relationship, the father should get automatic guardianship because there are many circumstances where that could be problematic.  She is correct.  There are many circumstances where it could be problematic and, therefore, it should not be automatic.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, and this is my problem with the Bill, the Minister's criterion for giving automatic guardianship, where the parents live together for 12 months, including three months after the baby is born, is arbitrary and meaningless.  It is a criterion for which the Minister cannot provide any rational justification.  It is arbitrary and therefore discriminates against unmarried fathers who happen not to live with the mother of the child.  I have a friend who is about to have twins with his partner and they will not be married.  They do not live together and they will not be living together.  To get guardianship, he is going to have to go through an extra hoop over and above somebody who happens to live with their partner.  That makes no sense.  The way to deal with this and to level the playing field is to remove subsection (3) in page 39 and the related paragraph (b).  In this way, for an unmarried father to get guardianship, he would merely have to sign a declaration.  That way one would not have these two different categories.  One would merely have to sign a declaration.  In addition, it should be made as easy as possible for that declaration to be made, unless the mother has an legitimate objection, which she might well have, and there should be a requirement on the State to inform parents about their right to make that declaration.  This arbitrary criterion the Minister has created jars and makes no sense.  I have explained how I think we could resolve this.

The process should be simple and should not involve people having to jump through numerous hoops.  It is the children we should be concerned about, fundamentally.

Having listened to the most recent contributions of Deputies Shortall, Boyd Barrett and Mattie McGrath, I would suggest that it boils down to the reality of situations.  If we try to create a framework for fairness and responsibility, having recognised the truth and reality of the situation, then we are on the road to respect for the individuals involved.  Anybody who comes into existence is an individual.  That may sound trite or too obvious but sometimes one has to express the obvious.  Everybody who comes into existence has the relationship potential of father, mother, daughter or son.  These are the four possibilities and they are extraordinarily valuable and unique to each individual.  Respect is what is needed for those relationships.<\/p>  <p>  If one starts timing and stop-watching obsessively to give the appearance of legislative safeguard, one can create a prison rather than a liberation for those individuals.  Therefore, I would be inclined to agree with the observations made by Deputies Shortall, Boyd-Barrett, Coppinger and Mattie McGrath but let us not get neurotically tied up with an algebraic approach because it does not work.  There is no stop watch or calendar to measure reality; they are convenient reference points for the truth of existence.  Therefore, whatever we can do to assure respect for the arrival of children into this world, as sons or daughters to fathers and mothers, should be done.  The relationships may, at any given point, be not so good or good; they will change.  People have mood swings within a day.  It is important not to snooker future human beings, whether they are mothers, fathers, sons or daughters and to give every prospect of respect by what we do.  These are some context thoughts to bear in mind before the ink dries on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200035#HH00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1426171200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>This is a particularly important part of the legislation which I also made reference to during the Second Stage debate.  All Deputies in this House will have had different experiences of how the law applies and will know of instances where flaws in the law became apparent later.  This is an extremely complicated area.  I am not a legal professional but would like to be one in the future, given the scope for such professionals afforded by this legislation.  The theory and practicality can be argued <i>ad infinitum<\/i>, as they will be.  They will be appealed to the higher courts and not always with the result that either the child or the parent might anticipate or want.<\/p><p>The concept of the rights and entitlements of parents must be set against their responsibilities and those responsibilities should be borne in mind at all times.  I would be inclined to favour the view of the mother and to weigh my thinking, on balance, in her favour unless there are very serious issues presenting, such as an addiction, for example, which might impact on her ability to be a good mother.  As we all know, when cases go to court there is generally an argument as to whether either parent is a fit parent and generally discussion revolves around the basis upon which such a conclusion is reached.  In some cases, situations can be constructed so as to make it appear that one parent is not a good parent and to be fair, the length of time that the courts have to deal with cases is not always sufficient to come to a sound judgment on that, although those involved will try to do the best they can.  We have all come across cases which seem clear cut on the face of it and about which a conclusion is reached.  However, if one were to investigate those cases more deeply, one would find variations and nuances that were not obvious at first sight and which would have impacted quite significantly on any judgment or evaluation made.  <\/p><p>Reference has already been made to guardianship and the wider implications for same.  We have all had countless experiences of situations where guardians, particularly in respect of social welfare legislation, have to go to the ends of the earth to prove that the other party is no longer willing to, or capable of, honouring their responsibilities.  As a result, some guardians may find themselves without adequate resources to sustain themselves and the child who is the subject of the guardianship.  I would hope that this will be borne in mind in the future and that we do not see pitfalls emerging which could mean that the welfare of the child, which is supposed to be paramount in all of these discussions, is at risk because of a lack of resources on the part of his or her guardian.  <\/p><p>We have all dealt with situations which are relevant here.  If a parent is absent without contact for a number of years, then regardless of previous living arrangements, it is very difficult to sustain an argument that he or she is seriously concerned about the welfare and well being of the child involved.  We have all come across situations in which one parent decides to absent himself or herself from the family home and disappear into thin air, as it were.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>They could then leave that partner, come back to the first partner after ten or 15 years and say ,\"hello, I'm back\", with them deemed to be the returning prodigal son and that all is well.  If a reconciliation can be reached, I am all in favour of it but I would not like to see the rights and entitlements of the parent who took responsibility during those years, went through all the hardship it involved, stood up to their responsibilities and reared that child or children on their own ignored in that kind of situation.  I would not like to see their situation weighed against them in a court.<\/p> <p> My last point relates to who determines what the child wants.  The legislation proposes that an expert such as a child psychologist would carry out this work.  We all claim to be experts in our own right, some of us to a greater extent than others in this particular business.  I fail to see how, in the space of an hour or two or even less, an expert can look into the eyes of a child aged five, four or three and work out what they think the child requires and what he or she favours.  I do not accept it at all.  It is unfair to the expert as well to ask him or her to come to the conclusion he or she has been asked to come to, namely, to tell the court what he or she believes the child wants because the child has hinted at this.  We should remember that even a very young child may feel intimidated by one or either party and may wish not to offend one parent or the other.  There are many nuances here that the Minister is aware of because of her own knowledge of the subject.  It is particularly important that we as legislators take cognisance of those very complicated issues that will emerge because like Murphy's law, if it can happen, it will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200035#HH00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426171800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their input and the points they made.  In respect of appropriate family courts, mediation and contact centres, we have had some very good pilot projects lately relating to contact centres where parents who have separated but who are in dispute about the children can be helped to work through the many issues.  This is preferable to these disputes being in court.  It is something I would like to develop.  The legislation will be useful in terms of determining those very complex issues because Deputy Durkan is right about the role of experts.  That is just one input.  In the legislation, we have defined the best interests of the child for the first time and provided ten or 11 criteria by which that decision will be made.  This will be a very useful framework for the court to consider when making decisions on custody, access and guardianship.  It will involve all those involved in ongoing relationships with the child and will examine the capacity of the parents to continue to be involved and a range of issues.<\/p>  <p>  I have already spoken about how domestic violence can be taken into account.  It will not just about one person trying to determine the views of the child.  It will be about that complex set of criteria being used to determine what should happen to the child.  I believe that where there are disputes relating to guardianship, custody and access, much more could be done, as is done in other countries, to make sure families agree these decisions outside the court setting through mediation and contact centres.  If it is in court, the development of family courts would be the way to go so that these issues would have the kind of time they deserve and decisions would be taken by people who have a special interest or expertise in the area.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the contributions are about becoming a guardian after one year.  The thinking behind this was to show a sustained relationship and a familial relationship in terms of living with the child but it was not considered to be too high a threshold in terms of the amount of time.  We are not saying it should it be three, four or five years.  We are talking about a period of one year so it is not a very high threshold.  I take the point made by some Deputies.  Deputy Boyd Barrett quoted a friend.  In that situation, clearly the statutory declaration is available immediately to that father.  The Deputy also argued that there are exceptional cases.  If he was quoting a different type of situation, he might be saying that there are certain factors in this case that I would be concerned about where this might be considered an exceptional case and where there would not be automatic guardianship.  I am making the point that there is work to be done on this and that I am committed to linking with the various groups who would make inputs into this.  I am very happy to engage in a consultation in the very near future to begin further work on this.  I have committed to a two-year review.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the point made by Deputy Coppinger about a year, it is a very short period because there is work to be done, for example, in terms of developing the regulations that will apply for the registrar in charge of the more readily available statutory declaration.  That will take some time.  It is a very short period to do the review.  I do not think we will have enough information for me to agree to the amendment.  I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment but I will commit to carrying out a consultation in the very near future with all of the relevant groups the Deputy referred to.  I repeat the commitment I made on Committee Stage that the Department and I will review the operation of the new guardianship provisions within two years of their coming into operation.  I also have the pilot project relating to the development of the register of guardianship.  We need a pilot project to tease out all the issues around that.  I am advised that it is a very substantial piece of work.  Given the number of guardianship arrangements in courts and the range we will have under this legislation, I need the pilot projects to see how that might be developed and to scope out the scale of the work that needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426171800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>We have had a good airing of the issues.

It would have been better if there had been a lot more discussion outside the House because of the complexity of family situations.  For some reason, this has not happened on television and in the rest of the media.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to clarify that I had a fantastic father and that I am all for fathers but I also recognise that it is not an ideal world, that there are situations where women and children need protection from fathers and that guardianship gives someone a lot of power over a family even if he is not living with the family.  If we are extending guardianship, we need some kind of review of it.  I also welcome the statutory declaration, which should be promoted.<\/p>  <p>  Some Deputies have given the impression that fathers are beating down the door to get access to their children.  We need scientific analysis of this because there is quite a vociferous fathers' rights lobby out there.  Most of us know situations where men are not treated equally in the courts but for every one case, we know ten others where women have been left supporting children economically and socially.  I favour a complete change in the way parenting happens.  It should be shared.  It is not right that it falls on women, which is one of the reasons there are very few women in this Chamber.  There are fewer women here than there are in the parliament in Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, the type of society we have puts the responsibility for child rearing on women.  This needs to change but until it does, we also need to recognise that there are men who do not take responsibility not just in terms of domestic violence, but in supporting their children over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200036#JJ00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1426172400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>There are thousands of fathers and mothers who are not married but who propose to live together, are living together, or have lived together but separated, all of whom share parenting relationships.

Many Deputies spoke about automatic guardianship rights.  As I understand it, under the legislation, entry of the father's name on the birth certificate is conditional.  It is important that protections be put in place in respect of particular situations.  I understand the Law Reform Commission has made proposals in this area and that measures in this regard are in place in other countries.  For example, in the case of a rape, the father's name would not necessarily be entered on the birth certificate and, therefore, there would be no automatic guardianship rights.

These are measures for better protection of the child in difficult circumstances.

This amendment would require the establishment of a central register for statutory declarations of guardianship.  I have already gone into the details on the complexity of the establishment of such a register, which we do not have at present.  I will make a number of points in this regard.  I am concerned that it should not become or be perceived as a necessary step in the acquisition of guardianship.  That is an important point to make.  The existing statutory declaration mechanism to make certain parents guardians is readily accessible, has no cost and is straightforward.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated, I am already taking steps to ensure people are more aware of its availability to become guardians with no cost implication.  It is particularly important that we should not make registration of the declaration compulsory because in any such situation there is a multi-step process and we do know from other experiences that it is possible for people not to complete the process.  I would not want that to be the case.  If we set up a system and there was a perception that failure to register a declaration could mean that a person would not be a guardian, it could have the entirely unintended consequence of making guardianship more difficult to obtain.<\/p>  <p>  I believe such a centralised repository as proposed by Deputy Mac Lochlainn could have value and I understand why people recommend it and Treoir has raised it.  Developing an appropriate solution will take time as further analysis is required.  The Deputy will appreciate there are related issues such as security, data protection and data exchange and management.  There are also financial implications.  I must examine a wide range of issues to which the amendment gives rise.  That will take time, but once we have had some consideration of the broad range of issues, I will establish a number of pilot projects in the coming months as the most appropriate means of testing the idea.  That will involve inviting parents who have made statutory declarations to deposit copies of their declaration in an administratively operated repository as a traditional security mechanism.  I will put such a pilot project in place.  We will get the agreement of parents who have made statutory declarations to examine the issues around it and to see how the process has worked.  I will report on the outcome of the pilot project to see what further steps may be required.<\/p>  <p>  On that basis, I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.  I will put a pilot project in place and see what range of issues arise because it is not simply a question of saying we will establish such a register and doing it.  The various issues to which I referred come into play.  It has not been done previously.  I am sure other Deputies share my surprise that there has not been an attempt to do this previously or to keep such records.  I expect one of the reasons is due to the huge complexity involved, the changes in guardianship the courts oversee daily, and the difficulty of the co-ordination of all that material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200038#LL00100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426173000,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I am surprised to hear what the Minister said.  However, I accept there are resource implications.  When one registers the birth of a child, the birth certificate is filled out.  It is already the case that a copy of the record is maintained and held locally and State-wide.  Having the parents' names on the birth certificate does not guarantee guardianship, but a record is kept of the birth certificate, which is very important documentation for many reasons as one moves on in life.  We cannot stand over the fact that the statutory declaration which gives one guardianship is not maintained centrally.  While I accept that the amendment and the proposition from Treoir has resource implications, it is necessary.  One cannot have a situation where there are serious implications if somebody loses a document.  I accept it is unlikely that someone would lose a statutory declaration, but documents do get lost and sometimes there can be mischief involved.  In the event of such happening, a person would not have a backup.  It is necessary to have a centrally held backup of proof of evidence that one has made a statutory declaration.<\/p>  <p>  If both parents register their names on the birth certificate, based on the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, they are notified that such registration does not guarantee them automatic guardianship and they are given an information leaflet.  They could be advised they have 14 days in which to apply for guardianship.  If at that stage the couple is happy and they come back and fill out the declaration but the relationship later breaks down the mother of the child would automatically have guardianship but the father would be in a difficult position because there is no central register with evidence of the statutory declaration, which is more important for the child in terms of parentage and guardianship than the birth certificate.  It is not enough to introduce a pilot scheme.  A central register must be set up.  Given that my party will resubmit the amendment in the Seanad in two weeks&rsquo; time, if the Minister cannot accept the amendment now, I urge her to think about the resource implications in the intervening period.

The former term more clearly links the concept to the child's presence in the household and the effect of violence on the child.  The purpose is the same, namely, to ensure that in considering the best interests of the child, the courts must consider the effects on the child of witnessing or experiencing violence. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 74 provides a revised subsection (3) to take account of the changed approach and focus more clearly on the risks the perpetrator of violence may pose to the child.  For additional clarity, amendment No. 75 removes the qualifier, if any, stating that a parent's conduct may be considered to the extent, if any, that it is relevant to the child's welfare and best interests only.  This is in response to concerns expressed that this could suggest that household violence or domestic violence between a child's parents might be interpreted as having no effect on the child.  Clearly, this is not the intention.  We know that violence in the home has a significant psychological impact on children, irrespective of whether they are directly physically abused.  International research clearly indicates that this is the case, as UNICEF points out.  Research in Ireland, such as the report, Listening to children: Children's stories of domestic violence, by Fergus Hogan and M&aacute;ire O'Reilly, supports this finding. <\/p><p> This set of amendments, which I imagine will get support, is intended to provide a clearer evidence-based approach to assessing the child's best interest where there is or has been household violence.  It also reflects the importance I attach to ensuring that the provisions that enable the court to take account of household violence are robust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200039#MM04500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426174200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426174200,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 74:<blockquote>In page 53, to delete lines 27 to 35 and substitute the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(h), the court shall have regard to household violence that has occurred or is likely to occur in the household of the child, or a household in which the child has been or is likely to be present, including the impact or likely impact of such violence on:<blockquote>(a) the safety of the child and other members of the household concerned;<br \/><br \/>(b) the child&rsquo;s personal well-being, including the child&rsquo;s psychological and emotional well-being;<br \/><br \/>(c) the victim of such violence;<br \/><br \/>(d) the capacity of the perpetrator of the violence to properly care for the child and the risk, or likely risk, that the perpetrator poses to the child.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200040#NN00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426174200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426174200,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 75:<blockquote>In page 53, line 37, to delete &ldquo;extent, if any,&rdquo;

I thank all those from my Department who have been involved in it, including Dara Breathnach, Carol Baxter and Conan McKenna.  I pay tribute to them.  I thank the Attorney General's Office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for the great support, expertise and hard work involved in bringing the Bill to fruition.  I pay tribute to my predecessor, Deputy Alan Shatter, for his great commitment to this legislation and the vast amount of work he put into the development of it.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, under the chairmanship of Deputy David Stanton, carried out a vast amount of work, in particular, the Opposition spokespeople in this area and the members of the committee.  The committee sought and examined 37 submissions on the Bill from the broad range of stakeholders during the discussion of the heads of the Bill last year.<\/p>  <p>  Inevitably in recent months there have been changes to the Bill and a development of certain issues that were raised.  We have taken on board the committee's recommendations.  We have been in a position to do that in several areas.  I believe Committee Stage was very constructive.  I hope Deputies will see that I have been in a position to take forward many of the amendments proposed by them, although perhaps not as fully as they would have preferred.  I believe, however, they will be able to see that we have progressed several of the suggestions made on Committee Stage.  The Department will be in a position to further develop work in several areas highlighted by Opposition Deputies, including the issue of the guardianship rights of non-marital fathers.  The debate has highlighted the complexities.  I believe there has been a good debate of the complexities of the area as well as the issues that need further work and I am committed to proceeding in that vein.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments agreed to date provide new mechanisms for parents to complete statutory declarations under an easy process.  Essentially, it involves a one-stop-shop where parents can combine birth registration and statutory declarations.  That will be supportive of fathers in particular and of the family situation generally.<\/p>  <p>  This is landmark legislation and it is long overdue.  It supports parents in diverse families and ensures that parenting will be supported by stronger and more cohesive legislative provisions.  Again, I thank Deputies and all involved who have ensured that we have completed Second Stage and passed this legislation today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200040#NN04400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1426174200,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on bringing the Bill to this point.

I refer specifically to the research published today in the online journal, <i>Human Resources for Health<\/i>, and which was overseen by NUI Galway.  Some might describe the evidence presented in the study as alarming and some as shocking.  A total of 2,273 medical students were surveyed, of whom 1,519, or 67%, were classified as Irish medical students, having completed secondary school in Ireland.  The remaining 33% were non-Irish.  What is of concern are the figures showing that 90% of the medical students &quot;may&quot; leave this jurisdiction having completed their medical education.  Like all politicians, I have some scepticism in that, if we were to rule our lives on the basis of such studies, we would not move too far.  Notwithstanding that, if the figure is anything near to 90%, by any yardstick, it would be a matter of concern for us all, including the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p><p>I am reminded that the taxpayer paid approximately &euro;75 million last year for those engaged in medical education.  In the lifetime of a medical course, the cost to the taxpayer is &euro;125,000 per student.  I am not suggesting in any way that we should intern them or nail them down but, given the difficulties in the health system and the lack of funding as a result of the country being destroyed, we must examine this issue.<\/p><p>Is the situation as bad as is portrayed in the study or is it more optimistic?  If it is not, what is the Minister's advice for rectifying the situation?  When I heard the Minister speak recently in the House, he told us about the lack of anaesthetists and the difficulties over pay, and the fact they will not stay because their experience is more extensive than just being qualified as a doctor.  Is the situation as bad as is portrayed in the study?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200041#OO00600","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1426174800,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  The recruitment and retention of doctors at all levels, from medical student to specialist, is important for me as Minister for Health and I am committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the strategic review of medical training and career structure, which was chaired by Professor Brian Mac Craith.  Through its various reports, the strategic review working group has offered solutions and recommendations, which, if we see them through, will ensure that we build a sustainable workforce for the future.<\/p>  <p>  I recently received the first progress report on the implementation of the recommendations.  I am pleased to say there has been a range of developments which will, I believe, help us recruit and retain doctors, including newly qualified doctors, in our health service.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, on foot of the working group's recommendations regarding consultant career structures, associated proposals for new salary scales for new consultants were recently supported in a ballot by IMO members.  Since then, the HSE has moved quickly to advertise positions with new payscales and there has been considerable interest.  I expect that these new scales and improved salaries will help us to keep more of our graduates at home and persuade consultants who are working overseas to return to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the quality of the training experience, there have been a number of developments which I am confident will have a positive impact on the day-to-day working lives and experiences of our trainee doctors.  For example, an agreement was reached last summer among health service management, staff associations and the training bodies on protecting training time for trainees.  The HSE has issued guidance on implementing this agreement to clinical sites, and I expect that all sites will adhere fully to the agreed annual limits for interns, specialist trainees and other non-consultant hospital doctors on professional competence schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In future, trainees will also have greater predictability regarding their rotations at the outset of their training schemes.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Most of those commencing basic specialist training this summer will know their rotations for the next two years, and I understand that the HSE and the training bodies are working closely to introduce pre-defined rotations for higher specialist training this July, where they are not already in place.  I also see the national implementation of the lead NCHD initiative as a very important step.  This initiative was piloted in five hospitals in 2014 and has been expanded to a further 26 hospitals for 2015.  The lead NCHD role provides an important link at management level between NCHDs and hospital management.  While these are all positive and welcome developments, more remains to be done to implement the full range of recommendations.  To support implementation, my Department has established a monitoring group comprising key stakeholders, including trainee doctors.  This will help us to drive implementation across the system and embed the recommendations in the day-to-day business practice of the health service.<\/p> <p> The first six-monthly progress report was published on my Department's website on 5 March, and I look forward to receiving the next report at the end of June.  The report will also be published online so that all stakeholders, particularly trainee doctors, can assess the progress we are making.  Finally, it is important to point out that, notwithstanding problems we are having with recruitment and retention, the number of consultants and NCHDs employed by the HSE is at an all-time high and the number of GPs contracts in the HSE is close to an all-time high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200041#OO00700","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426175400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the more optimistic conclusion of his contribution than is indicated in the study.  One of the difficulties is that historically there has been a transfer of people who qualify in medicine in Ireland.  It is an historic problem and is not terribly new.  I know from my previsions involvement with a committee in my local hospital in Tallaght that different medics have different views on why people leave the jurisdiction.  Some say it is because of remuneration, while others say they go to certain places such as America and Australia.

I would speculate that if one did a similar survey on many other professions one might get a very similar result.  It has always been the case that people migrate, something which is truer now than ever before.  We have a long history of doctors migrating to Ireland and from Ireland to other parts of the world, sometimes to get experience with a view to coming back.  Others want to work in international centres such as the Mayo Clinic or the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which will never exist in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important that we achieve an equilibrium so that similar numbers come in and leave.  That requires remuneration, and we now have agreement on consultant pay with the IMO, with new salaries being offered.  A left-led Government could propose to impose high taxes on people earning over &euro;100,000.  That, along with the risk of pay being capped at &euro;100,000 or a 60% tax rate above &euro;100,000, is a potential threat to our health service and would certainly leave patients at risk.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to improve the experience of working in our health service.  It is a difficult place to work for many people - not just doctors but other health staff.  The fact that doctors will know their rotations two years in advance is very important.  They will know where they will live in six months' time.  It is a simple thing which is now being done.  The fact that they will have dedicated protected training time when they are off-bleep is very important.  A lot more can be done in those spaces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200042#PP00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1426175400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Is the Minister taking any other Topical Issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200042#PP00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1426175400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I am taking three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200042#PP00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1426175400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>There is no Minister to take our Topical Issue.

I have submitted this matter several times over about five weeks, but it seems that when the House is due to close down for a week one has a better chance of being selected.  The Minister is not here, but I will welcome the reply of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p>  <p>  I am speaking on behalf of parents in north-west Kildare, but this is a national issue.  We have made tremendous strides in the primary school sector, and there are units for pupils with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, in virtually every school in the country.  Any new schools being developed will have an ASD unit.  While we planned well at that level, we have not planned for post-primary level.  The parents of many children who finish primary school would love to see them attend mainstream secondary schools, but they might not be suitable.  There are few ASD units in post-primary schools.  A number of parents in north-west Kildare contacted me.  At least three children there are finishing primary school and cannot access the local secondary school.  They have been offered places in Portarlington, which is 65 km away.  Asking children with ASD to travel for an hour and a half each way and adding three hours onto their school day is not acceptable for any child, especially those with special needs.  The arrangement is also costly; parents have said it will cost the Department in the region of &euro;95,000 per year per child, including the cost of a bus escort.  That is simply not a sustainable solution in view of the fact that such money would go a long way towards building additional ASD classes in the area.  There has to be some alternative solution.<\/p>  <p>  The local feeder school in Edenderry, Oaklands Community College, currently has one class with six students attending.  There is no room to take in another class, and to date up to ten families have looked for places for September 2015.  Clearly, it would make much more sense to put the money into building an extension to this school which would include additional ASD classes to meet the future needs of the area.  The principal of the school and the parish priest support the building of an extension to provide the much-needed classrooms.  The NCSE said it does not want to put too many children with ASD into the one area, which was the reason for not pushing for a unit in Oaklands.  However, there are 12 ASD primary classes within a seven-mile radius of Edenderry and these children must be provided for at post-primary level.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister may wonder why I referred to Edenderry, which is in County Offaly, but it caters for post-primary education for the whole of north-west Kildare.  There are currently up to 50 children attending primary ASD classes within a five-mile radius of Oaklands Community College in Edenderry who will need post-primary places in the near future.  One would hope that many of those children would go into mainstream classes, but a number will need to go into ASD classes.  Based on these figures, the Department needs to act now.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, this is an issue affecting not just north-west Kildare but the rest of the country.  The Department has planned for primary level but not post-primary level.  It is important that we plan for the future of those children who are leaving primary school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200042#PP00700","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1426175400,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it gives the Government an opportunity to outline the process of monitoring demand for school placements for children with special needs, including those with autism, and providing placements accordingly.<\/p><p>The Deputy is aware that this Government is committed to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through primary and post-primary school networks.  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.<\/p> <p> Young people with autism transitioning from primary school placements have a number of alternative options, including mainstream placement in post-primary school with support, placement in a special class in a mainstream school or placement in a special class in a special school.  The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with special educational needs, including autism.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in various geographical areas as required.<\/p> <p> SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for and to open new special classes each year in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post-primary school level to meet demand in a given area.  Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of special educational needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil-teacher ratio and special needs assistant support.  The total number of special classes for children with autism in mainstream schools throughout the country at the end of 2014 was 626, of which 152 were in post-primary schools.<\/p> <p> The NCSE has advised the Department of Education and Skills that it is currently planning, through its local network of SENOs, for a number of new special classes for the coming school year.  SENOs have been working with local schools on a national basis over the past number of months to plan and establish special classes for children with special educational needs who require such placements for 2015 and 2016.  This work is ongoing in some counties and SENOs continue to liaise and work with schools in order to meet the demand for such placements at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200042#PP00800","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426176000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I welcome the reply and there is a little bit of positivity in it.  I hope SENOs will be given much more authority in future planning for post-primary school placements for some of these kids.  There are 626 special classes but only 152 are in the post-primary setting, so sometimes the numbers do not add up.  I have highlighted a case where kids will potentially be travelling 65 km.  Even if somebody is going to a university or third level school in Dublin, one would not travel from Roscrea every day.  That is akin to what we are discussing, with some kids having to travel from south Kildare to Dublin city on a daily basis.  That does not seem fair at all.<\/p>  <p>  We have put in place an excellent service at primary level but we have not thought through the whole process.  I understand there is a variety of post-primary options but many parents want to see their kids at least attend post-primary education.  There are certain schools willing to cater for such students and they want to expand to allow more kids to attend.  They are being held by the Department not allocating funding for classrooms to be built.  I will continue to press with the Minister that we must continue to plan for the future in this regard.  There is no point in us doing a half-assed job when we must fully examine where the kids coming from these primary schools will end up.<\/p>  <p>  We should consider the issue on a long-term basis and the benefits will be felt throughout the whole of society.  There is always potential for a kid with autism to develop in a different manner than prescribed.  I welcome the Minister's comments but I will continue to press the issue, particularly in Edenderry, which has so many primary school kids coming out on the autism spectrum disorder.  The area does not have the facilities to cater for these kids who want to attend post-primary school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200043#QQ00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1426176000,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawlor for raising this important issue and I know he takes a great deal of interest in the matter.

I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, is here as he should have great empathy for consumers in the Border areas, which are once again the victim of bad decision making in Europe.  It is extremely regrettable that EU Ministers have agreed to delay the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges from this year to at least 2018.  The decision demonstrates a blatant disregard for consumers and prioritises large multinational mobile phone companies and their interests at the expense of the interests of customers throughout the 28 European Union member states.<\/p>  <p>  We are all very well aware of the punitive charges associated with roaming calls.  Those of us who live in the Border area, such as the Minister of State and me, know that when we go on a journey along the Border, we may at times be on our own networks of 3 or Vodafone but suddenly a British network can be used, leaving us with exorbitant charges for transacting business and making or receiving calls.  Sometimes mobile phone roaming charges are associated with people going on holidays but this issue affects a large cohort of people in this country who live in the Border area or who have good reasons to travel North and South to transact business daily.  All of us living in the Border area have at many times received exorbitant mobile phones bills as a result.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely deplorable that the communications Ministers of the European Union agreed to defer a decision made in 2014 and which was to be implemented by December 2015.  My understanding is there will be an \"assessment\" by mid 2018.  This is kicking a can down the road; a decision was made a year ago but the issue is now to be assessed more than three years into the future.  What proposals were put forward on behalf of the Irish people at the recent meeting when this decision was made?  People are bitterly disappointed.  There was a palaver when it was agreed to abolish roaming charges, as the indication was that costs would be reduced for consumers throughout the European Union.  Naturally, we are concerned about our own country first.  There has been little or no comment from the Government or the Minister about this deplorable decision, which was taken approximately a week ago.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State can convey through the Minister, Deputy White, to the relevant authorities in the European Commission and the relevant Commissioner that this is not acceptable.  A decision was made a year ago but now we hear nonsense to the effect that it will take time for companies to adjust.  I have never heard of a delay in implementing new or increased charges but there is always a delay if there is a need to reduce charges.  This is typical of European Union bureaucracy, giving in to the interests of the large multinational companies.  What was a very positive decision is now being reversed after 12 months and we are being told the issue will be assessed again three years from now.  That is absolutely reprehensible behaviour and I hope our representatives are making this argument at ministerial and other levels to the European Commission and the relevant Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200043#QQ00400","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1426176000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200043#QQ00500","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1426176000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  He is correct in that I have much empathy for what he describes as I have driven through the Border twice every time I have come to these Houses since 2002, or for 13 years.  It has been an issue.<\/p><p>I welcome this opportunity to clarify for the House the steps taken by the EU institutions to control, reduce and ultimately to eliminate roaming charges within the European Union.<\/p> <p> I am aware of the recent media reports which suggested the Council or the Commission does not support actions to eliminate roaming charges, or is seeking to delay the removal of roaming charges, contrary to the consumers' interest.  This is not an accurate representation of the true position.  The Minister fully supports harmonised EU actions to eliminate roaming charges, but this shared objective has to be achieved in a manner that avoids long-term adverse impacts on users of mobile phone services generally, including those who do not avail of roaming services.<\/p> <p> The EU has made substantial progress in reducing the maximum permitted roaming charges.  Three EU regulations, adopted since 2007, have progressively reduced roaming charges by an estimated 80%.  This includes voice calls, SMS, texting, and data-Internet access.  These substantial reductions in retail roaming prices are also sustainable due to the imposition of proportionate reductions in wholesale charges.<\/p> <p> The European Commission brought forward proposals for a future EU regulation to incentivise mobile service providers to remove roaming charges voluntarily.  The European Parliament adopted an amendment to the European Commission proposal which would prohibit retail roaming charges within the EU from December 2015.  The European Parliament's proposal does not prohibit the imposition of wholesale charges.  If service providers are prohibited from recovering those wholesale costs directly from retail users, it is inevitable they will seek to recover the costs from other users or reduce volume limits in bundled minutes and data package limits to control costs.  These outcomes would not serve the long-term interests of users.<\/p> <p> The shared position within Council is to give the Latvian Presidency a mandate to enter into negotiations with the European Parliament to reduce retail roaming charges further towards zero.  The revised charges, if agreed by Parliament, will deliver significant further reductions in regulated retail roaming charges and allow service providers to recover the wholesale costs incurred in providing the service.  The proposal provides for a further review of the regulation by June 2018 which will include a further review of both wholesale and retail roaming charges.<\/p> <p> I am glad to have had this opportunity to clarify for the House the significant progress which has been made possible by EU regulations to control and reduce retail roaming charges and to confirm that the Government's ultimate objective is to eliminate retail roaming prices in a manner which does not generate predictable adverse impacts for users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200043#QQ00600","speaker":"997","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426176600,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The response from the European Commission, which the departmental officials have accepted, is not acceptable.  The Minister of State said &ldquo;If service providers are prohibited from recovering those wholesale costs directly from retail users, it is inevitable they will seek to recover the costs from other users or reduce volume limits&rdquo;.  That is code for saying we are going to protect the profits of the multinational companies.  It is not acceptable that once again the interests of the international mobile phone companies come ahead of the consumer.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, Commissioner Kroes told her peers in the Commission and the European Parliament that she wanted them to be able to return to their constituents and say they had been able to end mobile phone roaming costs.  That has not happened and is not happening.  No matter how it is presented, roaming charges will stay with us in a different format.  If the annual profits of these international mobile phone companies operating throughout the European Union were analysed, we would be startled by the returns they make for their shareholders.  There is the added difficulty of poor mobile coverage.  Those companies have got away without investing in infrastructure.  If one is on a phone call for more than two or three minutes, particularly travelling northwards from the city, as the Minister of State and I know, every call drops out.  It is scandalous how little investment the mobile phone companies have put into the infrastructure to ensure there is a quality service.  Phone traffic has increased annually but there has been no worthwhile investment to ensure the consumer who is paying for the service gets a proper service.  The reply is most disappointing from the point of view that the European Union is saying it must tell the telephone companies how it will make up for their losses if it reduces mobile phone roaming charges.  It is not acceptable.

There are still charges if one roams into a different network, such as Orange or Vodafone UK.  There are data charges on top of that.<\/p>  <p>  Compared with 2007, the cost of outgoing voice calls has fallen by over 60% to 19 cent per minute.  I agree that we have to work towards zero.  Incoming voice calls have fallen 80% to 5 cent per minute.  Outgoing texts have fallen from 11 cent in 2009 to 5 cent.  Per megabyte data charges have fallen from 70 cent in 2012, when the regulation on data price was introduced, to 20 cent today.<\/p>  <p>  It is significant that the Latvian Presidency has been given responsibility to ensure we work towards proposals that would allow mobile service providers to charge a premium above domestic charges only to recover the regulated wholesale charges.  My colleague, Brian Hayes, MEP, raised this publicly during the week at the European Parliament.  I will speak to him about how we can move this forward.  The date 2018 was given but that seems a long time to work towards eliminating charges altogether.  I agree about the mobile coverage at the moment.  Everything is not hunky-dory; in fact it has deteriorated.  I met some weeks ago with the head of ComReg.  The new motorways were not built in a joined-up way with mobile phone antennae placed along the motorways.  We are playing catch-up.  Calls are dropping out.  We need more information on the infrastructural upgrades.  We need to know how much money is being spent.<\/p>  <p>  When I go to Cavan tonight, my calls will be dropping out the whole way and then I will probably go through Enniskillen.  The coverage in the North is very poor.  I hear, however, the mobile phone companies in Northern Ireland are making a substantial investment in their infrastructure.  They should make the same level of investment in the South.  We need an open, transparent conversation about mobile phone operators.  Local companies declare their profits publicly, but we need to ensure the end user is not the one left to do the heavy lifting.  That has been the case.  There are different attractive packages and bundling of minutes and so on and phone costs have come down, if one is smart.  If one brings one&rsquo;s iPhone to Belfast, the data charges are astronomical.  We are part of the European Union which must become a non-roaming charge environment for phone access.  I will have a long conversation with Brian Hayes to see how this Government, including the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who is also keen to work towards zero cost, can work with the European Parliament to push this important matter forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200044#RR00500","speaker":"997"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1426176600,"counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200044#RR00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1426176600,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200044#RR00700","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426176600,"counter":695,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 4.30 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 March 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
