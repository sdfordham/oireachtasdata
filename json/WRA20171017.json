We remain the most expensive in the OECD.  To alleviate some of this financial burden, I introduced a range of supports in September to make childcare more affordable for families, including a new universal subsidy for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age, or until they are eligible for ECCE.  This amounts to as much as &euro;80 a month or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.  In addition, subsidies provided under existing childcare schemes, specifically the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes have been increased significantly, in some cases by as much as 50%.  Eligible parents can access as much as &euro;7,500 per child per year under the CCS.  The full second year of ECCE will also assist parents somewhat from September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to measures aimed at affordability I am also seeking to address issues relating to quality service provision.  I increased ECCE capitation by 7%, the first increase since ECCE was introduced in 2010.  I also secured a total of &euro;18 million for 'programme support payments' for service providers to assist them with the administrative burden of delivering the various childcare schemes. <\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that pay and conditions for the Early Years workforce are highly inadequate.  In this regard I am conscious of the fact that while my Department is not the employer of Childcare professionals, it is a major funder and I will be supportive of efforts made by the sector to move this issue forward possibly by a Sectoral Employment Order with the Labour Court.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the 'Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare' has been commissioned by my Department, Crowe Howarth will soon begin to examine the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare.  This will include a survey of childcare providers.  Following completion, the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning future policy development and investment in early years.  It will feed into future policy development that will address both the cost of childcare for parents and the quality of service delivery which is greatly affected by the terms and conditions of the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700058#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Data","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700058#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[43445\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700058#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of referrals made to Tusla across all abuse categories in each of the years 2011 to 2016; the procedures that are followed following a referral to Tusla; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>In 2016 there was a total of 47,630 referrals made to Tusla.

While statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, and responsibility for the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding rests with the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government, my Department has undertaken a number of actions as part of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>.<\/p><p>These include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  This has been done under the existing Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme, which provides a subvention of &euro;160 per week for part-time childcare (three-and-a-half hours to five hours per day) over five days per week for all pre-school children aged 0 to 5 years inclusive.  From 26 June last the scheme has been expanded to include a second option covering child care for a shorter period of two-and-a-quarter hours to three-and-a-half hours each day over five days per week.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  Currently 83 children have been approved for this scheme for 2017\/2018 and a further 18 applications are awaiting decision.  The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.<\/p><p>It is very likely that other children in emergency accommodation are also registered under other strands of the child care programmes supported by my Department, though it is not possible to identify the exact number in each case.<\/p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.<\/p><p>Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. <\/p><p>In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.<\/p><p>Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.  A Joint Working Protocol between Tusla and Galway City Council and their contracted services providers was co-signed by Tusla and the City Council in July.  Galway County Council has agreed to meet with Tusla in the coming weeks to discuss a similar protocol.<\/p><p>Finally, the DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally.<\/p><p>Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.

Tusla had advocated for this important change to assist young people in making the transition from a young person in care to adult life, and to ensure consistency of support to these young people\/ young adults in aftercare from 18 years and up to 21 years of age.

The new measures announced in Budget 2018 form part of a trend of continued growth and investment.  In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, which followed from a similar 35% increase in Budget 2016.  Cumulatively the last three budgets have seen an increase of 87% in investment after decades of under-investment.  However, I have said on many occasions that we will need significant investment in every budget for many years to catch up with our OECD counterparts.<\/p>  <p>  The increase in supports now being implemented for the 2017\/18 programme year represents a major step towards accessible affordable quality childcare.  These increases reflect my ambition to support the provision of quality childcare services with appropriately supported and qualified staff. <\/p>  <p>  These increases are considerable, up to 50% in the targeted subsidies, which significantly decreases the amount of co-payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.  Parents can benefit by as much as &euro;7,500 per child per year under the new measures.  I also introduced a universal subsidy worth up to &euro;1,040 per year; this subsidy is aimed at children not yet in the free pre-school scheme.<\/p>  <p>  These changes are way-points towards our goal to deliver genuine affordable, accessible, quality childcare.  My Department is also progressing the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme which will ultimately replace all existing targeted schemes.  This requires robust IT systems and an appropriate legislative grounding.  We must ensure that the new system is absolutely fit for purpose as it will be with us for many years. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I recognise the pressures on childcare providers.  Before the end of this year, I will be providing a further amount of  &euro;3.5m towards &ldquo;programme support payments&rdquo; for all childcare providers who register for the scheme mentioned above.  This amount is in addition to the &euro;14.5m that has been already paid to childcare services so far in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The increase of 7% in ECCE capitation I just announced should be of significance to all providers as ECCE has become a corner-stone of most childcare services.<\/p>  <p>  Further, my Department has also provided capital investment of over &euro;12m in 2017 with dedicated schemes for both Early Years and School Age Childcare.  Investment will continue in 2018 with the detailed specifications currently being finalised by my officials. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised around sustainability, officials from Pobal and my Department identify and work with providers with serious concerns around their viability. &euro;1m was provided in Budget 2017 for &lsquo;Sustainability efforts&rsquo; and my Department is currently engaging with those providers to ensure that these vital services are provided with the necessary financial assistance.  An additional &euro;700,000 has been secured in 2018, for the purpose of assisting services enduring sustainability issues.  This increased funding will allow my Department to increase the scope of the current sustainability assessment model so that any service undergoing issues affecting their sustainability will have the ability to apply for additional funding under this stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700059#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":85,"content":"<p>Question No. 64 answered with Question No. 56.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":86,"content":"<p>Question No. 65 answered with Question No. 44.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700059#WRC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[43467\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700059#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the policy of her Department regarding the development of cr&egrave;ches and preschools in the Gaeltacht which operate through the medium of the Irish language; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[43466\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700059#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the policy of her Department regarding the development of cr&egrave;ches and preschools inside and outside the Gaeltacht which operate through the medium of the Irish language; the discussions she has had on this matter with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises that there is a need to provide supports in the Gaeltacht, and throughout the country, in relation to Irish language needs in the early years sector.

It will be chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and the membership will be finalised shortly. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, responsibility for communications will be assigned to an Assistant Secretary in every Government Department, who will work collectively to ensure cross Government cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  This initiative will be progressed as part of the Civil Service renewal programme.  <\/p>  <p>  This oversight is in line with my Department's Strategy Statement, its core values being: A deep-rooted public service ethos of independence, integrity, impartiality, equality, fairness and respect and a culture of accountability, efficiency and value for money.<\/p>  <p>  These core principles will inform how the Unit will conduct its business.  Its task will be to simplify Government communications and to increase efficiencies across the public sector when dealing with the Irish public.<\/p>  <p>  The Director of the Unit accompanied, by staff from the Strategic Communications Unit have been attending a series of meetings with Ministers, Secretary Generals and officials in Departments.  The purpose of these meetings is to help improve effectiveness, efficiency and cross-Government collaboration in order to foster and develop a whole of Government approach to communications. s part of this work, a network of communications officials across Government will be developed to share best practice.  This network of communications professionals will comprise the communications personnel within the civil and public service and will not include politically appointed personnel. <\/p>  <p>  The Government Press Secretary has not attended these meetings.  The staff of the SCU have been instructed not to attend meetings of political advisors.  All meetings must include civil servants.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants to make it easier for members of the public to understand its work and the services it provides.

This work will inform the future output of the Unit.  The findings of this survey and the audit of Government communications will be published on completion. <\/p>  <p>  No advice from outside agencies or consultancies has been sought by the Strategic Communications Unit to date.  My Department has issued requests for tender for other creative services.  These are being procured in accordance with standard procurement rules.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Communications Unit has no role in setting a positive news agenda, its remit is to inform the public of the work of Government in a factual and non partisan manner.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Budget a total of &euro;5 million was allocated to the Strategic Communications Unit for 2018, which will be funded through the Department of the Taoiseach Vote which actually saw a slight decrease overall in Budget 2018.  The Strategic Communications Unit intends to leverage opportunities for building the effectiveness of existing communications capacity across Government, as well as rationalisation.  A key part of the modernisation of Government communications will be greater use of digital media.  For example, recent initiatives such as the promotion of the whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie website and promotion of online videos relating to Ireland's Rugby World Cup Bid, information about going back to school and the Budget and Capital Plan cost a total of approximately &euro;19,000.<\/p>  <p>  There has been no change to the practice of publishing speeches to the Department's websites, which are up to date.

This means that Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Agreement, the CETA Joint Committee and the specialised committees established under its auspices are bilateral bodies representative of the European Union and Canada.  The European Commission will represent the EU, at the appropriate level, in these committees in accordance with the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.  In line with this principle, the selection of experts will be a matter for the European Commission to appoint on behalf of the EU, and Canada in respect of themselves.  It would be a matter for individuals with the requisite expertise appropriate in the particular matter (economic, trade, employment law, environment), to express their interest in serving as panellists direct to the Commission.  Member States have the right to be present and participate at the specialised committees in cases involving the adoption of decisions falling within the competence of Member States.  The powers of the CETA committees are strictly limited to the matters provided for in the Agreement.  Any changes to the text of the Agreement or EU regulations can only be made in compliance with the ordinary legislative procedure of the European Union.   <\/p>  <p>  The Agreement also provides for the establishment of civil society advisory groups that may submit opinions or make recommendations in relation to labour, the environment and trade sustainable development related concerns.  These advisory groups shall promote a balanced representation of relevant interests, including independent representative employers, unions, labour and business organisations, environmental groups, as well as other relevant civil society organisations as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note, that the provisions relating to investment protection and the Investment Court System (ICS) are excluded from provisional application.  Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national procedures.  In this regard, I have no immediate plans to ratify the Agreement given the Opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the EU-Singapore case and the recent request by Belgium for an opinion from that Court on the compatibility of the Investment Court System with the European Treaties. <\/p>  <p>  The potential costs for Ireland supporting the administration and operation of the Investment Court System in the Agreement would be very low.  It is impossible to anticipate the nature of any alleged discriminatory actions that would provide the basis for a successful case against the State given Ireland&rsquo;s adherence to the rule of law and the property protections of our Constitution.

If the Minister is satisfied that the process provided for in the 2015 Act has been complied with by the Labour Court, he shall make the Order.

Up to &euro;750 million of ISIF funds will be allocated to HBFI to provide funding on market terms.  This fund could have capacity to finance about 6,000 homes in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  HBFI will not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender and therefore will not have any role in designing the housing mix contained in the schemes it funds.  HBFI will provide lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor.  As such HBFI will not have targets in relation to social or affordable housing but will provide a significant contribution to supporting the delivery of additional supply of all types of residential housing in the coming years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the level of housing output will increase the affordability of housing more generally, which in turn also will have a positive effect on our ability to provide social housing. \u00a0For example, any residential developments\u00a0funded by\u00a0HBFI will be\u00a0subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments.  This includes policies relating to\u00a0Part V\u00a0of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and as such, it is expected that a minimum of 10% of the anticipated output of this investment by HBFI will become available for social housing through this statutory mechanism over this period.<\/p>  <p>  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 - 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, the HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.  The 2,000 units per year figure\u00a0is a simple average of the expected output and not a defined annual target. <\/p>  <p>  Though HBFI is intended to be a debt funder for private residential projects, I can assure the Deputy that this Government is equally determined to increase social housing output over the coming years.  For example, an increase of &euro;31 million has been allocated to the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme bringing the total to &euro;115 million.  This\u00a0is expected to\u00a0deliver an extra 4,000 social housing homes in 2018.  In my Budget speech on 10 October 2017,\u00a0I also announced an additional commitment to further accelerate the delivery of social housing from 2019.

This includes information on people&rsquo;s self-assessed employment and unemployment status and measures of the potential labour supply.  The unemployment rate was 6.4% in the second quarter of\u00a02017.  The QNHS assessments of potential labour supply ranged from 6.9% to 13.3% depending on the broader groups of people included (i.e. unemployed persons, discouraged workers, passive jobseekers, part-time underemployed persons). <\/p>  <p>  A recent Central Bank staff paper set out a proposed non-employment index that includes the potential additional labour supply, factoring in how likely each group is to transition to employment.  This paper estimated that potential labour supply in quarter 4 2016 ranged from 7.9% to 9.4% when part-time underemployed persons are included. <\/p>  <p>  There are a range of initiatives across Government which address employment, including issues around barriers to entering the workforce.\u00a0 These include the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work, the National Skills Strategy, the re-organisation of the further education and training sector and the Housing Assistance Payment.

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.<\/p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced.  Under the current legislation payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third-party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta's assets on completion of the liquidation process.  The liquidator commissioned actuarial consultants, Willis Towers Watson, to carry out an analysis of Setanta Insurance's claims reserves as at 30 June 2017 and this has now been completed.  The report estimates the claims reserves at between &euro;105.9 million and &euro;112.9 million.  This is an increase from the first report in 2014, which estimated the claims reserves at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  A consequence of this is that based on this actuarial report, the liquidator now estimates that he will not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation once all matters in the liquidation have been concluded, rather than the not more \u00a0than 30% of claims figure previously indicated.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering the implications of this actuarial report.

This section provides for the taxation under Schedule E of employment income arising to any member of a flight crew in circumstances where the duties are exercised on aircraft operated in international traffic and where the place of effective management of the aircraft operator is in the State.  The provision applies irrespective of the place of residence of the crew member. <\/p>  <p>  Part 42 Chapter 4 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 imposes an obligation on employers to make deductions at source under the PAYE system from the payment of emoluments to an employee (i.e. an individual operating under a contract of service) where those emoluments are taxable under Schedule E.<\/p>  <p>  Thus, where the provisions of Section 127B apply, flight crew will pay tax on their employment income under Schedule E and will be subject to deductions at source under the PAYE system.  In the case of a non Irish resident individual, whether this charge is relieved from Irish tax will depend on whether a Double Taxation Agreement is in place between the State and the jurisdiction in which the employee resides.<\/p>  <p>  Section 127B only applies where the individual is an employee and does not apply in the case of an individual operating under a contract for service (i.e. self employed).

The Act, which was commenced on 21st March 2016, inter alia provides for the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) which was established on the same date.  A key feature of the legislation is that taxpayers now make their appeals against Revenue decisions directly to the TAC and not through Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  The TAC has recently undertaken a consultative process related to the operation of its rules of procedure involving all stakeholders.  This was a listening exercise providing an opportunity to\u00a0raise issues about the operation of the reformed tax appeals system.  I have recently received a report from the Tax\u00a0Appeal Commissioners in relation to their consultation exercise which is under consideration in my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issues raised in the details supplied with the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Revenue has a statutory obligation to collect tax, pursue recovery of tax debt and ensure that the tax system is administered in a fair and equitable manner.  While tax write out features in the overall approach to tax debt management in all modern tax administrations, in the overall context of the collection and enforcement effort, the extent of recourse to write out by Revenue is very infrequent.  The only circumstance where tax is written out is where a business\/taxpayer is adjudicated insolvent, has ceased to trade with no assets, where collection is uneconomic to pursue, or where collection would cause undue hardship.  Where a decision not to pursue a debt is made, the debt effectively becomes dormant.  Tax write out only reflects a decision not to pursue the debt for a period of time and in certain cases, the write out can be reversed if and when Revenue considers that the taxpayer&rsquo;s circumstances have changed.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  All write-out cases are closely monitored by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Chapter 21 of the recent Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General &lsquo;Accounts of the Public Services&rsquo; report sets out the broad principles underlying Revenue&rsquo;s approach to tax debt collection and reviews Revenue&rsquo;s processes for &lsquo;writing out&rsquo; debt deemed to be uncollectible, the reasons underlying the write outs and the amounts of debt written out by category of tax.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Revenue&rsquo;s use of counsel and appeals to the Courts I am advised by Revenue that it does not always engage counsel irrespective of the size of the case.  Revenue has robust internal procedures concerning the use of counsel, both junior and senior.  The decision to engage counsel in an appeal is dealt with on a case by case basis.  There are appeals where Revenue officers present Revenue&rsquo;s case and there are appeals, particularly cases in which a point of law, rather than the quantum of a tax liability, is being disputed, where counsel (whether junior or senior) is more likely to be engaged. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue also advises that any decision to pursue an appeal case to the Courts following a determination of Appeal Commissioners follows an analysis of the both the quantum of tax at stake and the precedential nature of the point of law in question.  I am advised that certain cases where a relatively small quantum of tax is a stake could result in a significant loss to the Exchequer if an incorrect interpretation of law is accepted and applied generally, and that it is Revenue&rsquo;s duty to pursue cases where doubt exists as to the correct position.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to an opportunity to settle I am advised by Revenue that all taxpayers with an appeal have had, and continue to have, the opportunity to settle the appeal by agreement with Revenue.  On 21 March 2016, the date on which the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 came into operation Revenue was still dealing with appeals that were made before this date but that had not yet been referred to the Appeal Commissioners.  Revenue was obliged under Section 31 of the 2015 Act to refer such appeals to the TAC as soon as practicable after 21 March 2016.  However, before doing so, Revenue was required to notify the appellant of this statutory requirement and to request that the appellant indicate whether he or she wished to settle the appeal by agreement with Revenue or to have the appeal referred to the TAC for hearing.  Where the appellant indicated a wish to settle the appeal by agreement but agreement was not then reached, Revenue was required to refer the appeal to the TAC. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this express statutory provision, Revenue advise that they are always willing to engage in discussion with taxpayers and their agents with a view to settling appeals prior to any hearing before the TAC and also prior to any hearing by the Courts where a case proceeds to that level. <\/p>  <p>  As regards opportunities to address backlog I am advised that of the backlog of appeal cases on hands there is a significant volume of cases that may potentially by addressed in groups where the matter in dispute is common across a number of taxpayers.  While the authority to consider appeal cases in this manner is statutorily vested in the TAC,\u00a0 Revenue advises that it is very supportive of this approach and will provide any assistance necessary to the TAC to enable it to address the backlog of cases by considering appeals in groups where this is an appropriate approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700062#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":253,"content":"<p>Question No. 135 answered with Question No. 116.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700062#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[43857\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700062#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to provide tax credits for private well owners, group water schemes or those who have financed their own water supply but are also required to pay for water from general taxation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":256,"content":"<p>I have no plans at present to provide a tax credit for individuals in the manner described by the Deputy.

As such, I note that this document remains in draft format and was not finalised as it was overtaken by consequent major developments and policy statements.  I am informed that it does not reflect Revenue&rsquo;s current view on Brexit. <\/p><p>Like all Government agencies, the Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged in examining a range of scenarios in order to support Ireland's objectives.  This work is being undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework previously coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach\u00a0and now led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The precise customs arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK however it is clear that political solutions must be found before technical resolutions can be applied.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s priorities in relation to the unique concerns that arise for Ireland in the context of Brexit are very clear - to maintain the Common Travel Area and to protect the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including avoiding a hard border. <\/p><p>Evidently the closest trading relationship between the UK and EU is best for Ireland.  The Taoiseach has reiterated this position on many occasions, most recently in the D&aacute;il last week.<\/p><p>The Government welcomes that these priorities have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position and further welcomes and supports the Taskforce&rsquo;s paper on the &ldquo;Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland&rdquo;, which was published on 7 September.  The paper builds on the European Council Guidelines and reflects the priority Irish issues identified by the Government, including that, in view of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border, including any physical border infrastructure.  This must be achieved in a way which ensures that Ireland's place within the Internal Market and Customs Union is unaffected.  The paper also makes it clear that it is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to propose workable solutions in this regard.  It is the Government&rsquo;s view that the UK staying in the customs union and single market, or as close as possible to that, would be the best solution.<\/p><p>However, it is important that internal analysis continues in the meantime.

As the Deputy will be aware, the State is already providing a number of alternative supports into this market, including equity finance, through the ISIF&rsquo;s existing residential development funding platforms.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am not in a position to confirm the specific product terms and conditions requested by the Deputy, as these will be set by the board of HBFI in due course.  I can confirm that HBFI will be lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions, which would depend on the risk profile of each individual project, the quality of collateral and the creditworthiness of the borrower.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor, in that HBFI would not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender. Commercial viability testing will also ensure returns are the same as market norms.<\/p>  <p>  With a proposed allocation of up to &euro;750 million, the HBFI could have capacity to fund about 6,000 homes in the coming years.  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, the HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the delivery estimate included in the Budget documentation was based on an assumed delivery cost of &euro;250,000 per unit and an assumption that HBFI would recycle the allocated funding once over an estimated three year time horizon.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to State aid issues, the proposal has been designed to provide lending to the market at commercial rates.  The establishment of the fund will be discussed with the European Commission over the coming months and my officials have already had preliminary discussions with the European Commission in relation to the initiative.  As advised, there is clear legal separation between HBFI and NAMA and the proposal will not impact NAMA&rsquo;s mandate or wind down plans.  As a result, I do not envisage any impact from this proposal on the existing State aid complaint in relation to NAMA currently under consideration by the European Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would be hopeful of bringing the establishing legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in late 2017 or early 2018, with a view to HBFI commencing operations in Q2 2018.  It is not expected that HBFI will have an indefinite lifespan but it is too early to speculate on how long it may operate as this will depend on the availability of funding in the market to meet demand for homes in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700062#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Measures","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700062#WRF05200"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[44058\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700062#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the Brexit fund announced on budget day; the type of loans it will provide; the way in which companies qualify for assistance; the rate which will be charged on the funding provided; the organisation that will undertake the underwriting of loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[44061\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700062#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects the new Brexit fund to be up and running; when he expects the fund to commence lending; if this fund has been given State aid approval by the European Commission; the way in which he expects the Brexit fund to be compliant with State aid rules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, what is clear is that Brexit is likely to\u00a0affect Ireland&rsquo;s trade patterns and SMEs.  To meet the working capital needs of Irish SMEs and to assist them with adapting and innovating in response to the challenges, and opportunities, posed by Brexit I announced a &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Guarantee in my speech for Budget 2018.  This Scheme forms part of the wider Government Brexit Strategy and was developed by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. <\/p><p>It is intended that the Scheme will operate under the <i>de minimis<\/i>State aid rules and be supported by both State and European guarantees.  Loans at competitive interest rates will be available to all viable but vulnerable Irish SMEs and small MidCaps, businesses with less than 499 employees, who are exposed to the impact of Brexit.  As part of the application process, businesses will be required to produce a business plan that demonstrates how they intend to adjust to the challenges they face because of Brexit.  All applications will be assessed for eligibility by the SBCI and then subject to the normal lending assessment criteria of the commercial finance providers involved in the Scheme.  Due to State aid rules, the Scheme will not be available to primary producers in the agriculture sector or to the fishing sector. <\/p><p>I expect the Scheme will launched in March of next year.

Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school\/ETB.\u00a0 When an employer has an SNA vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in Circular 0042\/2017 &ldquo;Recruitment of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) &ndash;Supplementary Assignment Arrangements for the 2017\/18 School Year&rdquo;.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, under the provisions of Circular 0042\/2017, where a school\/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours\/posts, then that additional allocation of hours\/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment. <\/p>  <p>  These arrangements give SNAs the alternative of redeployment instead of redundancy and give SNAs greater stability and a better chance of a full-hours contract, while at the same time ensuring that schools can continue to recruit SNAs with the right skills and experience to meet the needs of the children in their care.<\/p>  <p>  The arrangements are reviewed annually by the unions, school management bodies and the Department, with the assistance of an independent chairperson, and this annual review enables the parties to examine and resolve issues arising in the operation of the arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  On 5 July 2017, I announced that 975 additional Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were to be allocated to schools over the period September to December 2017, a 7.5% increase in SNA numbers in order to meet the level of assessed demand.\u00a0 This announcement brings the total number of SNAs to 13,990, representing an increase in the total numbers of SNAs of 32%, from 10,575 to 13,990 since 2011.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, and as announced as part of Budget 2018, funding is being allocated for the recruitment of over 1,090 new Special Needs Assistants in 2018 (based on current forecasts), including some 130 posts which will be filled in the period between January and June next year, with the remainder being appointed from September 2018.\u00a0 This brings the total number of SNAs to over 15,000.<\/p>  <p>  It is inevitable that redundancies will occur in individual schools, due to circumstances such as a special educational needs pupil moving to another school, moving from first to second level, or second to third level, etc.\u00a0 However, overall and due to the significant increase in SNA numbers since 2011 and the introduction of the Supplementary Assignment Panel Arrangements, SNAs have benefited from greater stability in their employment. \u00a0I have no plans to amend the workings of the SNA supplementary panel to bring it into line with the panel which operates for primary school teachers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700064#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700064#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[43413\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700064#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the State bodies or boards that fall under the remit of his Department; and the number of members of each State body or board who are not qualified within the field in which the board or body has oversight.","asker":"1287","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>For the Deputy's information details of the State Bodies that fall under the remit of my Department, including details of\u00a0board appointments to the respective\u00a0State Boards are available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The Deputy should note that individuals may be nominated for appointment by various organisations arising from the terms in the relevant Statutes of the Body concerned and accordingly board appointments while made by me are not in all cases made at my discretion.<\/p><p>In line with the guidelines for appointments to State Boards, the process for filling vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of my Department is now generally managed by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).

Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

Decisions on the locations of the new missions were informed by the trade and investment strategy, &ldquo;Ireland Connected&rdquo; and consistent with forthcoming Asia-Pacific and Americas Strategies across government.  The locations for the new missions were identified on the basis of likely impact.<\/p>  <p>  Given the wide variety of local circumstances involved in establishing each new Mission and the need to consult with the host country Governments, it is not possible to provide further detail on the timetable for openings at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  The estimated cost of each mission will depend on a range of factors including staffing and accommodation.  The new missions will likely have from one to three staff from HQ with local support staff.  The &euro;2 million allocated in Budget 2018 will cover initial outlays incurred next year.  My Department will also need to ensure that the vital services infrastructure and policy support capacity at headquarters is adequate.  However, I anticipate that all necessary arrangements will be completed in a timely way.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will need to grow its presence in fast-growing emerging countries as well as deepen our market penetration in more developed markets and our diplomatic missions overseas will continue to be crucial in this.  The priority of my Department, as across government and state agencies, will be to support the growth of Ireland&rsquo;s share of international trade, employment and investment and the diversification of our markets where needed. <\/p>  <p>  Brexit is undoubtedly one of the most significant challenges the country will face in the coming years.  The Government has been clear that our priorities are to minimise the impact on our trade and economy; to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process; to maintain the Common Travel Area and to help shape the future direction of Europe.  The resources allocated to the expansion of our mission network internationally are an important strand in helping to mitigate the risks posed by Brexit to our economy including through diversification of trade with emerging markets and foreign direct investment flows.

The review concluded that a revised District and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.\u00a0 In the case of certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, the review determined that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As a result, the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was implemented, which resulted in the closure of some 139 Garda stations, including 9 in Clare and 8 in Limerick, and the amalgamation of 28 Garda Districts into 14 enlarged Districts.

I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  In addition to this, a further 800 Garda trainees are expected to attest in 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Limerick Division in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.\u00a0 I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.\u00a0 To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700066#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":484,"content":"<p>Question No. 219 answered with Question No. 217.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Welfare","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700066#WRK02500"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[43474\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700066#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the mental health supports in place for serving garda&iacute;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[43475\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700066#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the cases of five serving garda&iacute; who committed suicide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[43476\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700066#WRK02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if more supports will be rolled out to serving garda&iacute;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220, 221 and 222 together.<\/p>  <p>  It is the role of the Coroner Service to investigate unnatural or sudden deaths including deaths that may have resulted from suicide, in order to establish the &lsquo;who, when, where and how&rsquo; of an unexplained death.\u00a0 Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to be specific about the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who lost their lives through suicide as some cases of unnatural or sudden deaths of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may still be before the Coroner Service.<\/p>  <p>  That said, clearly the family, friends and colleagues of any Garda members who have lost their lives\u00a0through suicide are deserving of our deepest sympathies.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that following any such tragic loss An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na puts in place a comprehensive welfare response to assist and support members who may be affected.

These can only be imported, by way of licence, for use in organised displays\u00a0 and conducted by\u00a0 professional\/competent operators.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced new offences and penalties relating to illegal possession, sale and misuse of fireworks:<\/p>  <p>  - It is\u00a0 an offence for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,<\/p>  <p>  - It is an offence to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and <\/p>  <p>  - It is an offence to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.<\/p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 amended the Explosives Act 1875 to give Garda&iacute; the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks.\u00a0 The penalties for these offences are very severe.\u00a0 Having unlicensed fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply can result in a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment.

The carrying out of a valuation of a public utility undertaking (i.e. a global valuation') is the Commissioner's sole prerogative and I as Minister for Justice and Equality do not have any function in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Global valuations of public utilities are carried out on a five-yearly cycle as provided for in the Valuation Acts, 2001 to 2015.  The initial round of global valuations was carried out in the period 2004 to 2006 following the passage of the Valuation Act 2001.  The next round of global valuations was carried out in the period 2009 to 2011 and the latest round commenced in 2014 and was completed in 2016.  I am advised that the global valuation process is also deployed in other common law jurisdictions and is an efficient mechanism for valuing public utilities with a national or regional network on a five year cycle.<\/p>  <p>  In the most recent round of global valuations, the Commissioner carried out a valuation of two public utilities in 2014 and seven public utilities in 2015.  The utilities, with their respective valuations, were: the Electricity Supply Board - valuation &euro;389,000,000; and Eirgrid - valuation &euro;774,000; in 2014.  In 2015 the seven utilities were: Gas Networks Ireland - valuation &euro;110,570,000; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann - valuation &euro;8,930,000; Eircom - valuation &euro;84,700,000; Three Ireland -\u00a0valuation &euro;27,750,000; Meteor Mobile Communications Ltd - valuation &euro;20,720,000; Vodafone Ireland - valuation &euro;41,000,000; and BT Communications (Ireland) Ltd - valuation &euro;7,240,000.  Two further communications utilities were valued in 2016 - RTE Transmission Network Ltd - valuation &euro;4,200,000 and Virgin Media Ltd - valuation &euro;28,000,000.  The changes reflected in these 2014, 2015 and 2016 valuations arise from changes in the rateable value of each of the respective undertakings since last valued in 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  The global valuation process relates solely to the network occupied by the particular public utility and used by it for its principal object or purpose, such as the supply of electricity or gas or the provision of telecommunications or public transport.  These global valuations cover all of the pipeline networks and systems of lines, cables, masts, posts, pylons, wires and other ancillary constructions which pertain to the use or development of the utility and which are necessary to get its products to the consumer.  It should be noted that the global valuation does not include the valuation of other properties such as retail units or offices or industrial space occupied by the public utility but not used by it for its principal object or purpose.  These other properties occupied by the utility are valued outside of the global valuation framework and in the same manner as properties occupied by other businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The basis of valuation of all rateable property throughout the State is 'Net Annual Value' (NAV), as defined in Section 48 of the Valuation Act.  This applies to both public utility undertakings valued on a global basis and conventional rateable properties such as shops, offices and industrial facilities operated by other businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent global valuations issued by the Commissioner were in respect of the communications utilities RTE Transmission Network Ltd and Virgin Media Ltd on 5 September 2016.  Sections 53 and 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 require the NAV determined by a global valuation to be apportioned amongst rating authorities and the apportioned valuation to be reduced to rateable valuation ('RV') in the rating areas yet to be revalued.  This is a standard practice once a global valuation has been finalised. <\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the application of a Discount Factor, which is a technical mechanism to be considered when the global valuation is being apportioned between the various rating authority areas in which the network's property is located.  Its application, if and where appropriate, is to take account of global valuations made and placed on an existing valuation list of a particular rating authority area before a revaluation has been carried out in that area (under Section 19 of the 2001 Act).  This is a transitional provision provided for in the legislation to ensure equity and uniformity across all valuation lists.  It is not arbitrary and is intended to reflect the relativity of the values on an existing valuation list to the NAV of the utility.<\/p>  <p>  Statutory Instruments were prescribed to apportion the valuations and to reduce them to make relative as required by Section 53 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  As part of the process, and as required by Section 53(8), consultation was carried out with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Following detailed consideration of an appropriate reducing factor, a factor of 0.002343 was adopted for the global valuations published in both 2015 and 2016.  The reducing factor only applied in non-revalued areas and thus excludes the City and County Council areas of Dublin, Limerick and Waterford which have been the subject of revaluation.  I am advised that it was considered that, outside of the Dublin area, there had been no movement in the commercial rental market between the global valuation dates of 2014 and 2015.  Therefore the reducing factor of 0.002343 was retained for the global valuations of RTE Transmission Network Ltd and Virgin Media Ltd, both of which had a valuation date of 2015 and which were published on 5 September 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The global valuation is apportioned pursuant to Section 53(6)(a) of the 2001 Act, between each of the rating authorities in whose areas property comprised in the global valuation is situate.  The apportionment is in the proportion, expressed as a percentage of the total population taken under the last published census of population.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the collection of the rates, under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable by a particular ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation ('ARV') decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.

A number of scientific studies have looked at the specific issue of human disease and gulls (from the early 1980s on; the most recent in 2005).  While there is some evidence that wild birds (including gulls) may transmit salmonella to animal feed and drinking water and by this mechanism potentially lead to human infection, the evidence for this in each instance was considered weak.  Studies that have looked at the likelihood of direct spread of salmonella from gulls to humans conclude that gulls as carriers of Salmonella constitute little health hazard to human health concluding that there is only a low risk of transmitting Salmonella from either gulls or feed factories they may contaminate to humans or domestic animals.  <\/p>  <p>  The HPSC gathers information on the causes of outbreaks of infectious disease and for individual cases of infectious disease it collects information on individual risk factors (i.e. those factors known to contribute to disease development but not necessarily proven in the particular case being examined).  A look back for the last ten years by the HPSC, indicates that out of 25,000 reported cases of campylobacter and 3,500 cases of salmonella there have been three cases of salmonellosis that could be explained by bird contact (two of these were pet birds) and two cases of campylobacter, one of which mentioned proximity to gulls.  This means an association but does not mean that birds caused the disease.  <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee to address this issue.  The Committee meets Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to have an intersectoral co-ordination mechanism for addressing AMR at the European level.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as work on enhancing surveillance between the health and agriculture sectors, the Committee&rsquo;s work in 2017 has overseen the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020.  This ambitious 3-year Plan has been jointly prepared by the two Departments in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and covers the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as human health.  Following the World Health Organisation's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (2015), which requires all countries to have a national action plan in place by mid-2017, Ireland's draft Plan lists Strategic Interventions and Activities, responsible bodies and priority rankings of timelines for implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 (iNAP) will be launched on Wednesday 25th October next.

For specific travel advice, including information on vaccinations you should contact your G.P. or travel clinic as the HSE does not offer private vaccinations for travellers.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which is responsible for the regulation of medicinal products in Ireland, is aware of supply issues in relation to Hepatitis A vaccines.  These shortages are not specific to the Irish market and there are ongoing discussions at European level in relation to management of the shortages which have affected supply in a number of countries.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on the current information available to the HPRA, the current supply situation for the two vaccines is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Viatim (Typhoid Vaccine, Hepatitis A Vaccine, Purified Inactivated, for Adults) - Sanofi Pasteur Europe.  The company responsible for marketing the product (Sanofi) has advised that while the vaccine was recently out of stock in Ireland, it received a shipment of 10,000 units which was made available for sale in Ireland on the 10th October 2017.  The company has also confirmed that at present no further shortages or supply constraints for Viatim are expected for the remainder of 2017 or in 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  - Hepatyrix (Hepatitis A (inactivated) and Typhoid Polysaccharide vaccine (adsorbed) - GlaxoSmithKline (Ireland) Ltd.  This product has not been available in Ireland since approximately September 2016.  It is also out of stock in other markets.  The reason for the shortage is a combination of the company (GlaxoSmithKline) having insufficient manufacturing capacity to meet the increased global demand for Hepatitis A vaccine and also some manufacturing difficulties with the typhoid component of the vaccine.  At this time, the company is unable to confirm when supply will be restored.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700069#WRN06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Counselling Services Provision","counter":673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700069#WRN06400"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[43492\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700069#WRN06500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding of community counselling services as provided for by an organisation (details supplied) will be provided; the reason funding was refused by the lottery funding system; his plans to preserve this service into the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":675,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700069#WRN06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700070#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[43493\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700070#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review a matter (details supplied) and address the concerns of parents; his plans to enhance facilities or relocate these services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care to ensure sustained quality clinical operational management.  Overall, the NCPS aims to improve quality, access and cost-effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland. <\/p><p>Some of the achievements of this programme in improving access to services to date include:<\/p><p><b>National 24\/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis <\/b><\/p><p>Emergency thrombolysis is provided to patients in all parts of the country, via improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new stroke physicians.  The national stroke thrombolysis rate has increased from 1% in 2006 to a rate of 12% (2016). <\/p><p>The NCPS has developed a number of initiatives including a telemedicine programme to allow delivery of expert thrombolysis therapy in smaller level three hospitals.  It has been involved in the training of over 250 doctors nationally to deliver thrombolysis therapy and has participated in a training programme for Stroke in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. <\/p><p><b>Improved access to stroke unit care <\/b><\/p><p>Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced mortality rates, reduced dependency and shorter lengths of stay in hospital by patients.  Since the commencement of the NCPS, nine new stroke units have been opened, bringing the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-two.  Two further stroke units are currently in development with a third at planning stages. <\/p><p>This is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2006 which reported one stroke unit in the country.  However stroke units are typically too small and the recent national Audit showed that only half of stroke patients admitted spent any time in a stroke unit. <\/p><p>Admission to a stroke unit is a National Key Performance Indicator.  In 2016, 65.6% of Stroke patients were admitted to a Stroke Unit. <\/p><p>The HSE are considering the further development of Stroke Units in the context of the 2018 Service Plan.<\/p><p><b>Early Discharge of Stroke Patients<\/b><\/p><p>It has been recognised internationally that Early Supported Discharge of stroke patients from hospital improves outcomes, reduces need for long term care and increases acute hospital capacity by freeing up beds.  It is estimated the 10-25% of patients could benefit from an ESD service. <\/p><p>The programme has helped establish 3 small but effective ESD teams in Dublin and Galway.  In 2016, 137 patients were discharged to ESD services representing 15.6% of total stroke discharges. It is estimated that there was an average reduction in length of stay of 10.4 days per ESD patient. <\/p><p>Funding for increasing capacity in the three operational sites has been secured for 2017 with further funding secured to support the establishment of two further teams in University Hospital Limerick and Cork University Hospital.  Recruitment of these ESD staff is ongoing.  University Hospital Limerick is due to commence its ESD Service in the latter part of 2017. <\/p><p>As part of the phased introduction of ESD, the NSP has recommended a further 9 teams, to be established over a three year period and is under consideration in the context of the 2018 National Service Plan.<\/p><p><b>Emergency Endovascular Therapy &ndash; Thrombectomy <\/b><\/p><p>Thrombectomy is an emergency endovascular procedure that permits patients with severe strokes caused by clots occluding the major vessels of the brain and neck to have these clots removed using specialist devices.  HIQA has completed a Health Technology Assessment which found that this intervention is value for money. <\/p><p>Provision of emergency endovascular thrombectomy is available in Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital. <\/p><p>To date, the number of patients undergoing this procedure has risen annually, on average almost 50% increase each year: 2015 = one hundred and twenty two cases, 2016 = one hundred and seventy two cases, 2017 &ndash; end of August = one hundred and fifty four cases.  These patients have been referred from 20 different hospitals around the country.<\/p><p>The expansion of thrombectomy is under consideration in the context of NSP 2018.<\/p><p>The Stroke Manifesto published by the Irish Heart Foundation has been noted and it will be one of the factors that will contribute to the ongoing policy development in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700071#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Provision","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700071#WRP02900"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[43599\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700071#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if all nursing posts that have been filled in the Roscommon mental health service within the past two years were advertised;

Meetings with NHI have discussed a wide range of issues including the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, funding of Long Term Care, residential care standards, recruitment and workforce planning.  NHI was also represented on previous Working Groups chaired by the Department which considered the Care and Welfare Regulations and Towards a Restraint Free Environment in Nursing Homes.  In November 2016 NHI presented to the Interdepartmental Working Group established to oversee certain recommendations contained in the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I have had three meetings with the NHI, the most recent of which took place in September 2017.  A number of different issues were discussed, including nursing home charges, cost pressures, the recruitment and retention of health care assistants in the nursing home care sector and workforce planning and the implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme review. <\/p>  <p>  The NHSS is a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  Under law each private and voluntary nursing home must negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The process of setting prices with individual private nursing homes is commonly referred to as the NTPF pricing mechanism.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. <\/p>  <p>  A Steering Committee was established to oversee and manage the pricing review.  The Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) and the NTPF.  External consultants Deloitte and Prospectus were engaged by the NTPF in June 2016 to assist in its review of the pricing mechanism.  Numerous stakeholders were engaged in this process, including NHI.  Work in this area is ongoing and well advanced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700072#WRQ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","counter":829,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700072#WRQ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":830,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[43707\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700072#WRQ04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 760 of 21 March 2017, the progress made on the recruitment of an additional 4.5 whole-time equivalent sonographers at CUMH.","asker":"1276","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":831,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700072#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700072#WRQ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":833,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[43713\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700072#WRQ04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the alarm among disabled persons and their families and carers in County Donegal, caused by the closure of the swimming pool at a location (details supplied); if the swimming pool will be reopened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":834,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

As buprenorphine has more &ldquo;every day&rdquo; uses than methadone (it is widely used as a painkiller both in the community and hospital settings) and is available in a wide variety of forms, the Regulations will need to ensure that the additional controls which apply to methadone do not interfere with the current use of buprenorphine for other clinical indications and avoid any unintended consequences. <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the regulations will be finalised in the coming weeks.

Payment rates and actions for participants in BDGP II are the same as those in the original scheme, with the exception that the training and carbon navigator actions must be completed by 31st October 2017.

For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty was increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000, with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.  These penalties are in keeping with Irish jurisprudence and therefore I do not envisage further changes at this time.<\/p><p>Penalties imposed upon successful conviction vary at the discretion of the court, with the Act containing provisions that where an individual convicted of serious animal welfare offences may be banned by the courts from keeping animals, or indeed have the numbers of animals they may keep restricted. <\/p><p>The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 however has importantly changed the basis upon which animal owners must treat their animals and is specifically designed to allow early intervention in a much wider range of cases than the previous legislation allowed for.  Thus minor cases can be tackled before they escalate and the Act is a vehicle to encourage and educate animal keepers.  This new approach means that Authorised officers are addressing problems while they are relatively minor, reducing the risk of escalation.<\/p><p>Enforcement is a complex issue, so a progressive aspect of the Act is that it does not just focus on prosecution, which is only appropriate in cases where there have been serious welfare issues that can be clearly demonstrated to the courts.  The new enforcement approach reflects the need to intervene as early as possible in animal welfare situations.  This approach is aided by The Early Warning\/Intervention System (EWS) initiative introduced by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council involving, amongst others, my Department, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which provides a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming.<\/p><p>The Act provides for Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Notices to be issued by Authorised Officers.  This means that minor situations can be addressed at an early stage and that encouragement, guidance and best practice are introduced rather than just punishment.  It also provides for Fixed Penalty Notices to be issued in minor cases and allows authorised officers to seize and re-home animals where the owner&rsquo;s capacity to care for their animals is being overwhelmed. <\/p><p>The provisions of the Act are enforced by Authorised officers of my Department, An Garda Siochana, officers of Customs &amp;amp; Excise and authorised officers of ISPCA and DSPCA, along with individual officers of the Turf Club.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.<\/p><p>The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The\u00a0projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.

The EU Council of Ministers agreed its General Approach on this proposal on 13 October.  I am satisfied that the Council's General Approach provides appropriate recognition of different Member State circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.<\/p><p>With regard to Ireland's renewable energy targets, the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009\/28\/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding.<\/p><p>While good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advising that 9.1% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  The SEAI has recently estimated that Ireland could fall short of our renewable energy target by between 1% and 3%.  Moreover, in a document entitled <i>Ireland's Energy Targets - Progress, Ambition and Impacts<\/i>(published in April 2016), the SEAI estimated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.<\/p><p>The Renewable Energy Directive provides a comprehensive framework for Member States to work towards achieving individual and EU renewable energy targets, including mechanisms for countries to work together such as statistical transfers, which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.<\/p><p>The focus remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and a number of interventions have been taken to support renewable energy, including the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff supports.  New measures are also in development, including a Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and a Renewable Heat Incentive.  In any event, the cost of purchasing statistical transfers should any potential shortfall in Ireland's target arise has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, particularly the available supply and market costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700078#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":1110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700078#WRW00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1111,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[43503\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700078#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his Department has examined the effect of six pack plastic can rings on the environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1112,"content":"<p>Our use of plastic has increased exponentially in recent decades.

The new RESS will provide pathways for delivering on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland.  Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken.  The most effective policies to increase community ownership and participation in renewable electricity projects have been assessed and examined within an Irish context.<\/p><p>Examples of some of these policies include a mandatory requirement for all renewable electricity projects seeking financial support through the new scheme to offer investment and\/or ownership opportunities to the local community; the facilitation of grid access for community-led projects; a ring fencing of capacity (MW) for community-led projects; and the establishment of a national community benefits register.  Opportunities for smaller scale projects under a variety of local ownership models to get support will also be provided.  Furthermore, the Scheme will establish a network of trusted intermediaries who will act as\u00a0independent facilitators between communities and developers to support community participation in renewable energy projects.<\/p><p>Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment.  The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed.  These include amongst others, a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account.  This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.<\/p><p>I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation will have an important role\u00a0in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy,\u00a0in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country.  I have asked the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department\u00a0to facilitate a workshop on micro generation, and this will take place this week.  All relevant stakeholders have been invited to participate with the end goal being the development of a policy position on how best to support micro generation in Ireland.<\/p><p>A public consultation on the design principles of the proposed new RESS was launched on 4 September\u00a0and submissions are invited from the public.  All submissions will be considered and following on from this final public consultation, a design proposal will be brought to Government for approval.

The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee had its final meeting on 26 November 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people.<\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework.<\/p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.

Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015 places a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  These provisions will be commenced on 11 December, this year.<\/p>  <p>  If a child is taken into care, their needs are given priority.  A social worker is assigned to a child placed in State care and has a duty to prepare and regularly review the care plan for the child.  Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the wishes of the child are listened to, and if appropriate, Tusla may assist them in establishing residency.<\/p>  <p>  Unaccompanied asylum seeking children are placed in care and have their needs assessed, and are allocated a social worker.  <\/p>  <p>  As of the end of July, Tusla had received 20 young people under the Calais Special Project.  The young people were taken into the care of Tusla, and are receiving dedicated support and services, including medical and educational supports.  Before travelling to Ireland, these young people were screened by the Garda&iacute; and Department of Justice officials, and their residency status was approved.<\/p>  <p>  Children who, with their parents, live in Direct Provision, are provided with welfare supports as required.  Tusla have seconded an experienced social worker to the Department of Justice and Equality to liaise directly between Direct Provision and Tusla services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700081#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":1315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700081#WRZ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1316,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[44004\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700081#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which the investigative structures within her Department or bodies under her aegis are deemed adequate to meet current and future requirements as evaluated by reference to the time taken to respond to individual cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1317,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is required under the Child Care Act 1991 to investigate allegations of abuse, including historical abuse, and to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla provides a comprehensive rage of services and supports for vulnerable children and families.

The key principle of the Children Act 2001 is that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  When children come into contact with the criminal justice system there is an emphasis on the promotion of community based options in the first instance.  The Irish Youth Justice Service oversees a significant investment in community based programmes to divert young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2017, approximately &euro;14 million was allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown) and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established on a pilot basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Bail Supervision Scheme provides more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service provides a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.

The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation.<\/p>  <p>  The wide range of rehabilitation, education and support services provided and supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service are detailed in the Tackling Youth Crime: Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018, and a progress report covering the period 2014 to 2015 has been published and is available on my Department's website.

A person should have paid social insurance contributions before the age of 56 and, for a person reaching state pension age after 6 April 2012, should have a minimum of 520 paid contributions.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life, from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age, are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Contributions can be paid on income from insurable employment or self-employment.<\/p>  <p>  Employees who have gaps in their social insurance record where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods of unemployment or illness, may be awarded credits which are taken into account in assessing the level of entitlement to State pension.  Alternatively, where an individual is no longer paying PRSI as an employed or self-employed contributor, they can pay voluntary contributions, provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions of the scheme.  The payment of voluntary contributions helps to protect future entitlement to State pension as they are also taken into account in determining the level of pension entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative means-tested supports.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, a person may qualify for a means-tested increase for a qualified adult which is up to 90% of a full rate contributory pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  If a person has taken time out of the workforce on caring duties, they may have access to the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme.  Under the Homemaker's Scheme, any years that a person spent as a homemaker (since 6 April 1994) are disregarded when working out their yearly average contributions for a contributory State pension.

First, that it should ensure that work pays, and second, that it should have a positive effect on reducing child poverty.  To advance the commitment contained in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Department established an internal working group and an Inter-Departmental Group of the relevant Government Departments to consider proposals. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this process the Department carried out an extensive analysis of its existing range of supports that are aimed at assisting individuals to take up employment.  The analysis showed the existing in-work supports are very effective, and work well in assisting individuals make the transition from unemployment into employment. <\/p>  <p>  These findings are confirmed by the ESRI&rsquo;s research into the Department&rsquo;s existing in-work measures, and Eurostat figures, which show that the parental in-work poverty rate in Ireland is 5.8%, significantly below the EU 28 average of 11.2%.  This is in large part due to the Department&rsquo;s in-work supports such as Family Income Supplement and the Back to Work Family Dividend.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the analysis carried out by the working group did not support the need for the establishment of a new scheme.  In the context of Budget 2018 it was decided to re-designate the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme as the Working Family Payment (WFP), which will bring it more visibility as a payment aimed specifically at working families.  The new name better reflects the nature of the payment and the Department would encourage families to look into seeing if they are eligible for the payment.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the working hours requirement associated with qualification for payment of the WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  This &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  It is important, however, to ensure that the WFP does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment. <\/p>  <p>  For low-income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for the WFP and working on a casual basis up to and including 3 days per week, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme provide in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.  Individuals on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit can also work up to 3 days per week.  For each day they work they lose a proportionate reduction in their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment.<\/p>  <p>  If a person cannot meet the 19 hours WFP threshold the Department offers a number of other schemes, which can provide income support that can be combined with earnings from employment, subject to each individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  These include jobseekers allowance and benefit (which permit an element of casual work), disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance, the one-parent family payment, jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and the part-time job incentive scheme.  Combined, the Department provides an extensive system of social welfare support, which facilitates recipients taking up some employment while maintaining their social welfare payment. <\/p>  <p>  Given all of the above there are no plans to reform the operation of the WFP in terms of the number of hours work required to qualify for payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700083#WRBB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobsPlus Scheme","counter":1467,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700083#WRBB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1468,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[43729\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700083#WRBB05700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the details of the enhanced JobsPlus recruitment incentive announced in budget 2018; the moneys allocated to same; the targets set; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1469,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the JobsPlus incentive is designed to encourage employers and businesses to focus their recruitment efforts on those who have been out of work for long periods.

Entitlement levels to the State Pension, contributory (SPC), which is financed by PRSI on a pay-as-you-go basis, are calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.  The intention of this, as in the contributory pensions which exist in other European countries and elsewhere, is to incentivise and reward contributions into the fund which finance that pension, by means of higher pension entitlements.  Those with relatively lower contributions are more likely to be paid under alternative pensions, where they will attract a higher rate of payment.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of SPC easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.  It is estimated that backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 would cost some &euro;290 million per annum in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall rise in the cost of State pensions.<\/p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate SPC in their own right, the social protection system provides other ways of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  This is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State Pension (non-contributory), based on their household means, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  There are very significant income and capital disregards in the means tests for these payments, which result in the large majority of payees &ndash; most of whom are women &ndash; being paid at the maximum rate.  Where a person is a widow\/widower, they will generally qualify for a full 100% rate pension, based on either their own PRSI or on that of their late spouse or civil partner.<\/p>  <p>  The average pension payments made by my Department to men and women over 66 years of age are within 1% of each other approximately, and this results in very similar outcomes for older men and women in avoiding poverty.  The most recent CSO figures for Consistent Poverty indicated that 2.6% of women over 65, and 2.9% of men over 65, are in consistent poverty, which is less than a third that of the general population.  Eurostat figures also show that men and women over 65 are less likely to be at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland than in the EU as a whole, with the gap in outcomes between men and women being significantly narrower in Ireland than most countries.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) will replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.

The total employer debt to the SIF at 31 December 2016 stood at &euro;462 million. <\/p><p>A comprehensive analysis on the trading status of all companies and businesses with a debt to the Social Insurance Fund was completed in April 2017.  Approximately 13,400 individual employers owe a debt to the Social Insurance Fund.  <\/p><p>A total of 9,305 of Irish registered companies account for the vast majority of employer debt (91%).  The profile of these indebted companies indicates that the majority (63%) are either dissolved or are in the process of being wound up through receivership or liquidation.  These account for almost &euro;345 million of the total debt. <\/p><p>A third of indebted companies (c 3,450) has filed annual returns in recent years and are categorised as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; by the Companies Registration Office.  These companies account for c &euro;72 million of employer debt.

These account for just over &euro;41 million in employed debt (9% of the total). There is no central information source on the trading status of these non-registered businesses.<\/p><p>The Department has a dedicated debt management team in the redundancy and insolvency section which has responsibility for managing employer debt in line with the Department&rsquo;s debt management policy.  The team engages directly with employers who are categorised as normal, and with the non-registered sole traders and partnerships, with a view to recovering debt.  The team makes contact with these employers to establish their financial position and ability to repay the debt in full or as part of an agreed debt repayment plan.  In these cases the Department is mindful that an overly aggressive process in pursuing debt with employers that are still trading, but are nevertheless in a financially precarious position, might result in those companies being pushed into an insolvency situation which could result in further job losses.  Accordingly the unit engages with employers to establish the situation on a case by case basis and seeks to recover debt on a mutually agreed basis, including setting up repayment by instalment where appropriate.<\/p><p>A total of &euro;10.7 million in funds paid out of the SIF to cover redundancy related payments was recovered by the Department in 2016.

YEI funding is reserved for use in those regions, including Ireland, where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012.  The specific YEI funding allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our European Social Fund (ESF) allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m. <\/p>  <p>  The YEI is integrated into ESF programming and is being delivered in Ireland as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.  This programme is managed by the ESF Managing Authority, within the Department of Education and Skills.  Seven actions were originally selected for YEI funding, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach, Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and Momentum.  These actions are underway and are being fully funded up-front by the Exchequer.  <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that while no application has been made to date to the EU Commission in respect of the YEI, it is expected that the European funding will be fully drawn down.  The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  In this regard, the PMC has agreed in principle to the further inclusion of the Community Training Centres, which are funded by the ETBs in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  The ESF Regulations provide for initial pre-financing\/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation.  However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  As Ireland did not submit an interim YEI payment application, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission.  This reimbursement has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, as the YEI activities are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to them. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the ESF Authorities in the Department of Education and Skills intend to submit a payment application to the European Commission in respect of the YEI following its designation in accordance with the EU Regulatory requirements in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also obtained EU funding under the European Commission&rsquo;s call for proposals for preparatory actions under the Youth Guarantee Pilot, to pilot a Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun which operated in 2014.

Public notification of\u00a0beach closures is generally by way of beach notices, local authority communication networks and via the national bathing water website () operated by the EPA.<\/p><p>The EPA's Bathing Water Quality Report for 2016 identifies several bathing waters adjacent to urban areas as being prone to episodic pollution events and being of less than 'good' water quality status.  The requirement for bathing restrictions, either as an &lsquo;advice against bathing&rsquo; or a &lsquo;bathing prohibition&rsquo;, is determined and implemented by the relevant local authority, rather than\u00a0the EPA. Such restrictions are generally put in place as a precautionary measure following elevated bacterial counts from routine sampling which indicates the potential for increased public health risk, or as a proactive warning of possible pollution e.g. in advance of predicted heavy rainfall events.  The choice of restriction is based on decision criteria agreed between the EPA and the HSE.\u00a0<\/p><p>An assessment of bathing water incidents by the EPA shows that many, in particular those affecting major urban centres around Dublin Bay, are likely to be\u00a0linked to discharges\u00a0from sewage outfalls, often following rainfall events.  This is particularly so in the case of Loughshinny where existing wastewater infrastructure is under considerable pressure. In the cases of Merrion Strand and Sandymount Strand, investigations have shown pollution inputs from human waste contamination of surface water streams through misconnections as well as from avian and canine sources.

There are currently over 28,000 households in receipt of HAP, including more than 8,000 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.  Unlike Rent supplement, households in receipt of HAP support can work full-time without losing their housing support.<\/p><p>Under HAP, a tenant sources their own accommodation, the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).  The Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward every 24 months unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  The requirement that the rent set is not above the market rents for similar properties applies in designated Rent Pressure Zone areas and in non-designated areas.  When undertaking a rent review, the landlord must provide three examples of rents for similar properties in a comparable area to demonstrate this.  Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Residential Tenancies Board where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.<\/p><p>The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area.\u00a0HAP applicants are informed of the maximum rent limits for their local authority area; these elements of the scheme are stated in the HAP Tenant Information Booklet, on the dedicated HAP website, , and local authority staff are expected to explain them to each HAP applicant.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.\u00a0 Greater enhanced support is also statutorily provided for in the\u00a0Dublin Region for homeless households.\u00a0 It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Local authorities must also be cognisant of the provisions\u00a0 of the Residential Tenancies Act\u00a0when approving increases in HAP payments and advise tenants accordingly.<\/p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord. Where a qualified household sources accommodation outside the maximum rent limits, it is important to highlight the responsibility falling on the household as set out in their tenancy agreement.\u00a0 From available data,\u00a0at\u00a0the end of Q.2\u00a02017, and excluding the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region, 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefitting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits.  In the Kerry local authority area,\u00a027 of the 194 households supported by HAP at that point, or\u00a013.9% of households, were benefitting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits.\u00a0<\/p><p>The data available to my Department at this time indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits, provides local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700084#WRCC05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","counter":1522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700084#WRCC05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1523,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[43857\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700084#WRCC05200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to provide compensation for private well owners, group water schemes or those who have financed their own water supply but are also required to pay for water from general taxation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1524,"content":"<p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services recommended that the principles of equity of treatment and equivalent financial support should be applied equally between households on public water supplies and those in Group Water and Sewerage Schemes, those using septic tanks and those with individual water supplies.<\/p>  <p>  The Water Services Bill 2017 is currently being considered by the Oireachtas.\u00a0\u00a0The provisions in the Bill give effect to the recommendations of the Committee.

There are currently more than 28,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of HAP payments.  A weekly average of 348 HAP tenancies have been set-up during 2017.<\/p><p>HAP is a form of social housing support under which local authorities will make monthly payments on behalf of tenants directly to landlords in respect of rent, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.  All the terms and conditions of the HAP scheme for both tenants and landlords are available on the dedicated HAP website, , and associated HAP documentation.<\/p><p>HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the local authority in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme.  As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.  HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements. <\/p><p>The HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme.  The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise.  This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. <\/p><p>Outside the formal notification letters there would always be attempts to contact the tenants by phone and by email to settle accounts and avoid escalation of the debt process.  Depending on the activity of arrears in question, both the relevant local authority and the landlord are informed when an account has not been cleared and of possible suspension and\/or cessation of the HAP payment.  However, in the vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise the landlord. <\/p><p>If the tenant does not contact their local authority or does not enter into a payment arrangement within 8 weeks of the arrears commencing, both the landlord and the tenant are informed that the HAP payment may be ceased.  To date the approach has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants.  In 2016, when 12,075 additional households were supported by HAP, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities.  Therefore, a very small number of tenants have fallen in to difficulty with their differential rent.  In 99.7% of cases where the tenant has had difficulty, this has been resolved with their local authority without any impact on the landlord&rsquo;s payment.  Therefore the likelihood of a HAP payment to a landlord being suspended or stopped is very small and occurs in only a very limited number of cases. <\/p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700085#WRDDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":1551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700085#WRDDD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1552,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[43833\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700085#WRDDD02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his Department's new HAP tenancy targets for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, in tabular form.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1553,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[43834\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700085#WRDDD02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his Department's new RAS tenancy targets for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, in tabular form.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1554,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 608 and 607 together.<\/p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)\u00a0is a social housing support introduced to cater for the accommodation needs of persons who are in receipt of long-term rent supplement.

612 and 618 together.<\/p><p>Housing\u00a0affordability for individual\u00a0households\u00a0is\u00a0a unique function of, inter alia,\u00a0income, prevailing market prices and rents in different locations, as well as access to funding and finance.\u00a0 While there\u00a0is no universally ideal price\/rent-to-income ratio or minimum residual income requirement, there is broad agreement that households, particularly low- to moderate- income households,\u00a0should be spending no more than one third\u00a0of their net income on housing costs over the longer term.<\/p><p>The development of the State land bank for housing is a key Government objective and to this end, the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map was published on 27 April 2017 and is available at .  Local authorities and the Housing Agency are now\u00a0finalising Development Management\u00a0Plans for their sites.<\/p><p>The final development model for\u00a0each site, including the tenure mix,\u00a0will be\u00a0the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, including its elected members.  The development of many sites for social and affordable housing is already underway. \u00a0For example, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed-tenure housing, with projects advancing that can deliver\u00a0around 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone and other sites planned.<\/p><p>Funding for 34 projects under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF),\u00a0at a cost of\u00a0&euro;226 million,\u00a0will be key to the delivery of more than 20,000 new homes over the next four years.\u00a0 There will be homes available at below &euro;320,000 on 70% of the\u00a0sites being opened up through this enabling infrastructure.  South Dublin County Council has approval for three projects at Adamstown, Kilcarbery, and Clonburris, respectively.  The total cost of these projects is &euro;27.4 million, of which &euro;20.5 million will be funded by my Department, and &euro;6.9 million by South Dublin County Council.  These projects are expected to\u00a0facilitate the delivery of\u00a03,000 homes by 2021 and have the potential to support 11,500 housing units in the longer term, once the sites are fully built out.<\/p><p>As I have previously\u00a0signalled, the Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country, and as such\u00a0housing affordability has been examined across a range of interconnected policy areas in the context of the ongoing focused review of Rebuilding Ireland.  A number of new and enhanced\u00a0actions in this area have\u00a0already been announced and I expect to make further announcements in the coming weeks\u00a0as this work is finalised.<\/p><p>New measures introduced to date, to\u00a0enable the provision of affordable homes, to buy or rent,\u00a0include:<\/p><p>- Planning\u00a0reforms, such as\u00a0the\u00a0fast-track planning approval process for developments of scale\u00a0with over 4,000 homes worth of applications\u00a0submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la;<\/p><p>- Reduced and\u00a0reformed development contributions; <\/p><p>- Rent caps in specific Rent Pressure Zones; and<\/p><p>- Amendments to apartment planning guidelines to allow for more cost-effective and affordable apartment\u00a0development for our city centres.<\/p><p>On 10 October, as part of Budget 2018, I announced an additional &euro;75 million in Exchequer funding for new affordable housing initiatives.<\/p><p>Firstly, there will be a second LIHAF fund of &euro;50 million to unlock even more sites, more quickly, and at affordable prices.\u00a0 Secondly, I&rsquo;m introducing a new fund of &euro;25 million, to be provided over 2018 and 2019, aimed at\u00a0unlocking local authority-owned land specifically in order to deliver affordable housing on those sites.\u00a0 My Department is currently drawing up the criteria for access to this scheme, to be announced in the coming weeks, along with further affordability measures.<\/p><p>In terms of residential land more broadly, the combination of the capital gains change and the more than doubling of the vacant site levy to 7%, as\u00a0signalled in Budget 2018, will help to address the issue of land hoarding and to release more land for residential development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700085#WRDDD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund","counter":1567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700085#WRDDD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1568,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[43839\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700085#WRDDD03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the expected draw down of LIHAF funds in 2017; the expected carryover of unspent LIHAF funds from 2017 to 2018; the LIHAF allocation for 2018 including carryover; and the way in which the &euro;50 million announced for the second LIHAF call related to the initial announcement of the &euro;226 million LIHAF announced in 2016.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1569,"content":"<p>The total cost of the 34 projects approved under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund is &euro;226 million, of which 75% (&euro;169.5 million) will be funded by my Department, with local authorities funding their 25% share (&euro;56.5 million).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This funding is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and will be available for local authorities to drawdown over the lifetime of the projects.\u00a0\u00a0The total allocation for 2017 is &euro;50m but given that most projects are at design phase there will be an underspend on LIHAF this year.
