We have prepared a document entitled, Ireland - Agriculture, a key part of our economic recovery, which sets out the steps we believe the Government must take to support Irish farming as it seeks to develop under the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.  Amid the doom and gloom, the farming sector in Ireland is still very much alive, with agrifood exports, according to Bord Bia, worth &euro;8.8 billion in 2011.  The key point is that the majority of the money earned from agrifood exports is spent in the local economy.  As such, it is vital that the sector is nurtured and encouraged in order that it can continue to be a key player in Ireland's recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Gilmartin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352972100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Taxation is a major issue and the ICSA urges the Government to proceed with caution in the forthcoming budget.  The trend has been to introduce all sorts of increases - not, I accept, in headline income tax rates but rather in many other areas.  Capital taxation has been targeted in this regard.  In recent budgets, all capital taxes were brought up to 30%.  In our view, we are approaching the maximum here.  There is no room for any further increases in capital acquisitions tax, particularly in view of the increase in the rate of and the lowering of the threshold relating to this tax in budget 2012.  We believe that to apply any further increases to this tax would be counterproductive for the wider economy in the context of long-term export targets because such increases would basically undermine farm development and viability in circumstances in which a property is being passed from one generation to the next.  To put this in real terms, the changes in last year's budget meant that a young farmer taking over a business whose land and other assets exceeded &euro;2.5 million in value - which is not a huge sum in the context of farmland, stock, etc. - is at risk of a substantial tax liability on the excess at a rate of 30%.  That is not a good incentive when one is only starting out.<\/p><p>  We are calling for the reversal of the measures introduced in last year's budget which led to an upper limit of &euro;3 million being placed on capital gains tax retirement relief in cases in which the farmer handing over the land and assets is aged over 66.  In the first instance, such a farmer receives no benefit when he or she transfers the assets to the next generation.  The idea in this regard was to try to encourage people to hand over their farms before they reach 66 years of age.  The reality is that while early transfer is desirable, it is not always possible for a variety of reasons.  These include age, the circumstances of the successor, etc.  This is just a nasty tax.<\/p><p>  It goes without saying that income tax is also a major issue.  Despite the Government's stated policy to place more emphasis on expenditure reduction rather than tax increases, the reality is that this objective is hindered by the measures contained in the Croke Park agreement.  The cumulative impact of all of the budgets introduced since 2007 is that income tax, combined with PRSI and the universal social charge, is at a level which is really damaging the incentive to work.  In addition, it is extremely onerous for unincorporated sole traders such as farmers.  The ICSA submits that there is a serious need to review this increase in the effective tax rate - where there is profitability - to 52%.  When we say this, we are mindful that if a farmer buys a parcel of land adjacent to his property, he is obliged to pay for this out of after-tax income.  It is continually stated that 12.5% is the maximum rate of tax we can afford to impose on companies.  For many reasons, farmers do not want to go down the road of incorporating their businesses and they are being taxed at a much higher level as a result.  Self-employed people and workers who help farmers, such as veterinarians and silage contractors, are all being affected by that to which I refer.<\/p><p>  We are also concerned about the fact that the taxes on fuel are damaging to the sector.  These have had a huge impact in the context of escalating silage costs, which, in turn, undermines the viability of cattle enterprises.  It is also leading to increased purchasing of fuel outside the jurisdiction.  I do not refer here to green diesel relating to silage but rather to live exports of cattle.  All of these extra carbon costs are adding to farmers' overall costs.  We call on the Government to suspend the carbon tax to alleviate pressure on businesses, including those of farmers.  With the tax standing at over 6 cent per litre on green diesel - or &euro;20 per tonne, up from &euro;15 per tonne before 1 May 2012 - it is adding costs to the farming process and is definitely hindering farmers' ability to produce and export at competitive prices.  The current rate of &euro;20 per tonne is costing farmers &euro;32 million per year.  A double offset in respect of carbon tax and income tax was introduced last year but this is extremely difficult to administer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352972700,"counter":11,"content":"<p>A mobile phone is interfering with the sound transmission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500005#D00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352972700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We also sound a note of caution on the cost of doing business and the impact that has on competitiveness.  Much thought is put into cutting costs every single day by farmers.  For example, we call for an immediate reduction of 10% in electricity costs, which are a huge burden on the sector.  The Government must be much more proactive with ComReg in terms of examining how to drive down costs in areas in which they have some influence.  We seem to be very quick to increase costs in quasi-public-sector utilities but not as conscientious about bringing them down.<\/p><p>  The Government has been largely unable to tackle the issue of public sector pay as a result of the limitations of the Croke Park agreement.  In our view a disproportionate amount of cuts are being made to vital schemes across all Departments, but this includes farming schemes, front-line services and capital investment, which has been hit more than current expenditure.  That is unsustainable.  The Government will have to face up to issues such as increments and allowances in the public sector.  Farmers could rightly argue that payments from schemes such as the disadvantaged area scheme, DAS, and the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, form part of their core pay.  There is a clear sense that this crisis is not being tackled in an equitable way at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speech","time":1352972700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Punch and Mr. Gilmartin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500005#D00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1352972700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the ICSA delegation.  It is important to have these discussions before the budget.  The committee had a good budget discussion yesterday with the Minister.  It is vitally important to hear from the farming sector and the representative bodies.<\/p><p>  I will respond to some points made in the presentations by Mr. Gilmartin and Mr. Punch.  The last point raised is an interesting one.  It relates to the overall picture in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the question that is often asked about the administrative burden and inspectors.  We heard this morning that 6,000 digital inspections are being carried out around the country.  I am sure the witnesses talk to farmers in rural areas often.  A raft of inspections have been carried out this year by inspectors around the country.  Three inspectors were in west Donegal yesterday inspecting land in what was the wettest year ever.  The cost of those inspections is excessive.  The question must be asked about the administrative cost within the Department versus the cuts to the schemes.  Reference was made to the Croke Park agreement.  According to figures, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has an excess of 185 full-time equivalent staff.  Issues must be addressed with regard to staffing costs and whether there can be reductions.  By 2014, the staff ceiling in the Department must be cut by 433 based on the employment control framework, ECF, ceiling that was set down in conjunction with the EU-IMF programme.  If we were to transfer those staff to other Departments there would be a saving, which could and should be transferred into schemes.  The Minister must seriously consider this option in the lead-up to the budget.<\/p><p>  We all hear commentators and the Dublin media say often that farming is doing well at the moment and farm incomes have increased.  That is true to some extent, but we all know that costs have increased as well.  The farming schemes are crucial.  We are not here to talk about the CAP negotiations, but they are important also.  I hope we will have another opportunity to talk about that.  Reference was made to the suckler welfare scheme, which is important.  There is a provision of &euro;25 million in the budget this year for it.  One must take into account that calves born this year will have to be funded next year at a cost of &euro;12 million.  That provision must be made available in next year&rsquo;s budget.  According to discussions the committee has had with the Minister, he is looking at the option of not opening the suckler welfare scheme to new entrants next year.  That would be a disaster.  When the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, was before the committee in recent weeks, one of the questions I asked the delegation was about the importance of the suckler welfare scheme and its funding into the future.  The response I got was that the decision on its funding is a no-brainer.  It is important that the suckler welfare scheme is available next year.  I fully support the argument that the scheme should be available.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the DAS and the REPS.  The changes that were introduced to the DAS in last year&rsquo;s budget did not work because people were able to get derogations and make appeals that were upheld.  Some of the appeals are currently being considered and they will be successful because if one is in a special area of conservation or a natural heritage area or is in the REPS or the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, then the changes introduced do not work.  A total of &euro;190 million was allocated and approximately &euro;183 million has already been paid out this year under the DAS.  More money remains to be paid out.  The DAS is important because it provides aid to farmers on the worst land in the country.  The three categories are mountain land, more severely handicapped and less severely handicapped low land.  The breakdown of the allocation in the three areas is 35% mountain, 45% more severely handicapped and 20% less severely handicapped.  A total of 101,000 farmers were paid under the DAS last year and the average payment was approximately &euro;2,000.  I am not sure what the view of the witnesses is on whether money could be saved under the scheme or where the focus of the savings should be.  Mountain-type grazing must be totally protected.  Those who cannot increase stocking rates should not be asked to do so.  To retrospectively ask farmers to increase stocking rates on land that they cannot farm because of the conditions placed on them by the National Parks and Wildlife Service is totally unfair.  If savings could be made, should the Minister focus on the less severely handicapped areas, or should no savings be sought on the DAS?<\/p><p>  The 62,000 farmers that are gradually coming out of REPS by 2014 are a major concern.  The vast majority of them are on poorer quality land than larger farmers and they are dependent on the scheme as a source of income.  What should be put in place of the REPS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500005#D00500","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352973300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and it is good to have this discussion.  We have held a number of meetings and we all agree it is important to do so prior to the budget.<\/p><p>  I agree that agriculture has helped us in our difficulties in recent years, particularly last year which was a very good year, but this year will not be as good because of the bad weather.  Any gains made last year in agriculture will be lost this year as farmers will have to spend money because of the bad weather.  I agree with the points that have been made and we will make every effort to ensure as few cuts as possible.  However, we are told there must be cuts to the agriculture budget and there we have a difficulty.<\/p><p>  The suckler cow scheme is very important and has built up much data for farmers over the years.  It would be a pity if anything happened to it at this stage.  Perhaps, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill suggested, if a cap of 25 or 30 animals was introduced it would at least keep the scheme in place until we are in a better position in years to come.  Perhaps under the new CAP budget and Pillar 2 more money will be put into it in a year or two.  It has done a good job and is very important.  Farmers have been very much involved, in particular with Teagasc, and have come together in groups.  This helps farmers gain more information and we produce better quality cattle as a result.<\/p><p>  We are very concerned about the disadvantaged areas scheme, which must be maintained.  It was one of the first schemes introduced for farmers in the 1970s.  The 12 western counties were the first to gain from the scheme and as the years went by it was extended into other parts of the country.  It is very important to maintain it.  An attempt was made last year to save money on the scheme but, as has been stated, much of this money will not be saved because of the derogation and the appeals process.  Many farmers will be able to receive payments under the scheme.  A small amount of farmers will lose out but most of them will receive a payment.  The earmarked saving of &euro;30 million in the scheme will not happen.<\/p><p>  A factor which was not touched upon by the witnesses is the problem with stocking density on commonage.  If the proposal were to go through it would have very serious consequences for farmers.  I have received many calls in recent days about this and even now I hear my phone bleeping.  Serious problems exist.  Yesterday we were assured no letters would go out to farmers so this is good news and will give a little breathing space.  REPS planners preparing AEOS plans for farmers will be given an extra two or three weeks to sort out this problem.  Over the years there has been abuse on commonages and we must sort out this problem.  If we do not do so Europe will come down on us, and we saw what happened with regard to septic tanks when we left matters drag on and did not deal with them.  This problem has existed for ten or 12 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500006#E00200","speaker":"1124","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352973900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival.  I thank our guests for attending.  I read their submission briefly and many of the points made make sense.  As I went through them, I was struck by one, in particular.  The budget is under pressure and there will be cuts.  However, we must be realistic, as every Department is in the same position.  It would be good if we could tell our guests that everything would be fine, but it will not, as difficult decisions must be made.  Trying to keep inside current budgets is not easy.<\/p><p>  I cannot disagree with the comments made on many of the measures in question or the costs involved.  The upper limit of &euro;3 million on capital gains tax for people over 66 years of age has been mentioned.  The age profile of farmers is unacceptably high and we need to try to reduce it aggressively.  For some reason, it has been creeping upwards.  Perhaps it has something to do with the Celtic tiger of a number of years ago, but we need to start reducing it.  Installation aid, retirement schemes and so on would be welcome and were fabulous while they were in place, but there is no money for them currently.<\/p><p>  The proposal on making stock relief available at a rate of 50% is not a bad one.  The pension levy has been in place since the jobs initiative and is working well in terms of tourism.  One hopes some of the benefits will accrue to rural communities.  We cannot do much about electricity costs.  As our guests know, the price of green diesel has increased from 45 cent three years ago to 83 cent or more.  It is a dreadful cost that every farmer must deal with in some fashion.<\/p><p>  The submission criticises the Croke Park agreement.  However, criticising it is easy.  I am from the farming sector, but the public sector has seen more than 30,000 redundancies and must still deliver more services.  The agreement is working, but we are borrowing &euro;1 billion a month and will go through tough times.<\/p><p>  I do not see any in the document, but do our guests have suggested solutions to the problem of active versus inactive farming?  Many of the document's contents are aspirational.  I have asked everyone who has presented to us to recommend solutions.  Map farming, whereby two people live off of a single acre, is unacceptable.  The industry needs to tackle the issue.  It makes no sense for an inactive farmer to sign the single farm payment form.  It is virtually criminal taxation of the active farmer.<\/p><p>  The fragmentation of land is another farming issue.  Do our guests have opinions in this regard?<\/p><p>  Committee members understand it will be a difficult budget.  Applying fair cuts and achieving a balance are the real issues.  We understand that, although this has been a dreadful year weatherwise, which most of us did not believe would be the case, farming is the one bright area.  I would welcome our guests' comments on these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500007#F00200","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1352973900,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending and making their presentation.  They are right to highlight the fact that the public sector is protected by the Croke Park agreement and that it is a shame that the farming community did not have such a luxury afforded to it in recent years.  What our guests are asking for can be summed up by the saying, &quot;What we have, we hold&quot;.  The farming sector has suffered as many, if not more, cuts as anyone else.  It has taken a significant hit and is telling the Government that it cannot take any more and that the current schemes should be retained.<\/p><p>  The Government could take simple measures that would make a difference.  For example, I am glad to see that the carbon tax issue was included in the presentation.  Proposing a carbon tax is nonsensical at this time.  It would be stupid beyond belief to impose it on the people of Ireland, given the high cost of fuel.<\/p><p>  Regarding what is occurring on the ground, there seems to be an attack on the farming community in the form of inspections.  Farmers feel as if they are being criminalised.  If a person in another walk of life fills in a form and makes a mistake, then it is a mistake.  However, if a farmer makes a genuine error when filling in a form, it is an offence.  It is as if he or she is a crook.  I could never get my head around this.  I am not referring to the Government alone, as successive Governments and Departments have treated farmers in this way.<\/p><p>  Our guests are acutely aware of the pressure farmers are being put under everyday because of a combination of issues, for example, bad weather and silage pits being opened and found to be rotten.  Each of our guests knows someone - I certainly do, and I am no exception to the rule - who has taken his or her own life owing to pressures at home on the family farm.  It is shocking and awful, but it is happening.  At this time having an overzealous inspection regime does not make sense.<\/p><p>  I will always call a spade a spade.  Although this is a pre-budget submission and my next issue has been touched on, I am disappointed by the proposals on commonages.  This issue poses a major problem.  Last week the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>printed a report on the minimum and maximum numbers of sheep to be allowed on commonages and the impression was given that letters would issue shortly.  On Tuesday night the Minister assured me that the letters would not be issued.  The truth is that they cannot be issued.  I will cite an example to show how impractical and unworkable the proposals are.  <\/p><p>  Four people have a right to a particular commonage.

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the disadvantaged areas.  I agree with everything Senator Comiskey said.  It started with 12 counties and was then expanded.  There are only very obvious places where a saving can be made, although I do not know how much it would be.   The disadvantaged area payment originated as a payment for cattle and sheep farmers.  At present, there is a minimum and maximum stock rate and there are retrospective considerations and so forth.  However, nobody looked at why seven donkeys will get the same payment as seven suckler cows in Mayo, Donegal, Leitrim or Clare.  Why are they not dropped out of the scheme?  Why are the hobby people who are breeding Connemara ponies, for which there are no big markets, and who are not producing food in the scheme?  A certain amount of savings can be made there.  The disadvantaged areas scheme got too big.  Everybody got a slice of the cake.  In pillar 2 of the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy there must be a specific scheme put in place for people with marginal land in the poorer areas of the country.  That goes back to what the original disadvantaged areas scheme was for.  For heaven's sake, make the representation and drop the donkeys and horses from it.  A significant saving can be made there.  In Pillar 2 there must be a separate scheme for the hill areas where people have low payment after taking a huge cut in disadvantaged area payment and where the REPS payment is gone.<\/p><p>  In our view limiting or putting a ceiling on the suckler welfare scheme will not work.  The scheme is working very well and many people participate in it.  More importantly, there is a huge amount of information being collected by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, on breeding, calving difficulties, meat yield and so forth.  We should keep our hands off it.  It has already been cut by 50%, so it should not be cut again.  I realise the average cow herd in Ireland is approximately 18 but it is a great deal more than that for the average full-time farmer.  It would also hit the most vulnerable people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500008#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Gilmartin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352974500,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry talked about fragmentation of land.  We continuously make the point about roll-over relief.  This also ties in with the increase in capital taxes.  It only arises occasionally so there are no real implications for the Exchequer.  They are one-off cases.  Where the opportunity arises for a farmer to dispose of an outside field and buy a field next door, he is absolutely crucified by the combination of capital taxes, so it is very hard to do it.  Stamp duty was cut and that is welcome, but if he ends up paying a little more for the land next to him he must make those repayments out of after-tax income.  If one makes enough profit to be able to pay for buying the field next door, it is 52%.  That is just one example.<\/p><p>  With regard to ESB costs, we are not here to advocate cutting public sector pay.  We are well aware of the fact that most of the people in that sector are earning low wages.  On the other hand, however, one must ask why are we discussing cutting a disadvantaged area payment when the ESB average wage is &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  A college lecturer in the UK earns &pound;48,000; the equivalent wage here is &euro;70,000 to &euro;80,000.  We must always ask why the most disadvantaged farmers are being hit in this case.  To be fair, our view is that the REPS got too big and too costly.  We all must admit that.  There were 62,000 people in it.  We must be a little more sensible about targeting decent payments to people who really need them.<\/p><p>  In future we would like to see marginal farmers being looked after a little better under schemes such as the disadvantaged areas and agri-environment schemes.  In Ireland, a huge number of farmers are depending on a single payment of &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000, or even up to &euro;20,000, under REPS and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  They are active farmers.   They would not be the biggest and most productive farmers, but they are active.  They have experienced a huge reduction, almost a halving, of their payment before we even discuss CAP reform.  These are the guys we are concerned about in that regard.  Perhaps targeting is the answer.<\/p><p>  With regard to the young farmer installation aid, we proposed &euro;10 million.  The reason is that each year we are watering down the residual costs of the early retirement scheme and what is left is the odd young farmer installation payment which has been made over the last number of years.  That is gradually decreasing.  It reduced by &euro;3.5 million last year and has been reducing each year since those schemes were shut down under the previous Administration.  There is some scope there.  As people come out of REPS there is scope to do a little more.  There is no reason to be cutting.<\/p><p>  Gross voted expenditure for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food went from &euro;2.1 billion in 2008 to approximately &euro;1.3 billion last year.  That is a huge cut.  That Department appears to have taken a much higher proportional cut in its expenditure than many of the other Departments, so I do not understand why we keep coming back to agriculture.  That said, some of the Government's plans do not work quite as well as it might appear.  In 2011, the Estimates for agriculture put Exchequer pay at 7% less.  That was due to redundancies, early retirement and so forth, but Exchequer pensions are correspondingly 29% higher.  That is just for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is difficult to achieve savings in current expenditure in the Department and that is why we urge the Government to look at the overall picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500008#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352975100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Regarding the CAP proposals, we have been speculating about it for the past while.

With regard to the budget and the Croke Park agreement, we do not have to touch the Croke Park agreement in order to make savings in the agricultural budget next year.  With regard to the agreed ceiling on staff within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the six non-commercial State agencies, including Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute, the National Milk Agency, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and Teagasc, there is a proposal to reduce the staffing number from 5,000 by 10% by mid-2014.  That amounts to a reduction of 500 staff.  Why can we not do that next year?  It does not involve redundancy but transferring staff to the Department of Social Protection and the appeals office, where there is a need for additional staff.  It can be done.

Witnesses are correct in respect of the commonage issue.  In discussion at committee, the Minister agreed that the letters would not issue until we had a discussion and input into the matter.  The farming organisations should be given the same opportunity of meeting the Minister and his officials and having an input.  We can recommend that to the Minister.  To ask 20 farmers on a hill, some of whom may not get on with each other, to sit down and get one REPS planner to draw up a plan, to have a minimum and maximum stocking rate and to agree the number of sheep they will farm on the hill is unworkable.  The people in the National Parks and Wildlife Service who drew up this plan have no regard for, or understanding of, farming practices.  I agree with the comments of Senator Comiskey.  The farming organisations, including the IFA and the ICSA, should have an input into this.

Agriculture has been one of the sectors in the Irish economy that has stood up best in the post-boom period and has delivered on jobs and exports.  The last couple of years have been tough for the Irish economy and agriculture has been one of the few sectors where employment has been maintained and the 300,000 jobs in the agriculture and food sector are very important.  We outlined to the committee during our pre-budget presentation last year that there are opportunities arising from the protection of agriculture.  The recent announcements by the Kerry Group, McDonald's and Kepak are all real and sustainable jobs.  It is important that this committee supports the IFA in its efforts to protect agriculture.<\/p><p>  In the upcoming budget, there are a number of key issues of concern for Irish farmers.  The clear message from the farming sector is that support for agriculture is critical to underpinning economic growth.  Over the past few years, the agri-food sector has delivered real employment growth, with potential for further expansion and employment creation in the coming years.  Underpinning this growth is a primary agriculture sector that is delivering a high quality, sustainable raw material to the food sector.  Agriculture contributes to economic activity in every part of Ireland and is of particular importance in the rural economy.<\/p><p>  Farming, however, remains a low income sector, and the importance of farm schemes in underpinning farm income and production cannot be forgotten.  REPS, AEOS and the suckler cow scheme account for 50% of cattle and sheep farmers' incomes on average.  In addition, as the committee is aware, farming is experiencing a very difficult year in 2012.  A combination of dreadful weather conditions, soaring input costs and falling prices in some commodities is impacting on profitability and output at farm level.  In its mid-year outlook, Teagasc estimated that farm incomes could be back at 2010 levels, which would represent a fall in incomes of close to 30%.  In addition, the impact on farm incomes of previous cuts to farm schemes is now being seriously felt.  These cuts impact directly on farm income and have a negative knock-on effect on production decisions on-farm.<\/p><p>  The cuts in funding for farm schemes in last year's budget, in REPS and the disadvantaged area schemes were far in excess of the cut in the overall agriculture budget.  These came on top of cuts that have been imposed on farm schemes since 2008, including the closure of REPS to new entrants, cutbacks for the disadvantaged areas, suspension of the early retirement and installation aid schemes, halving of the suckler cow premium and cuts to the forestry premium.  Like all other families, farm families have been negatively impacted by increased taxes and charges that have been introduced and will be affected by any new taxes in the budget.  They cannot be hit on the double by further cuts to farm schemes.  There is no justification for this in the upcoming budget.<\/p><p>  I want to outline now the priorities for agriculture in the budget.  The proposed reduction in funding for the agriculture budget of &euro;114 million, or 8% of the budget, represents a greater reduction in funding than that required, on average, across all of the Government Departments.  The IFA believes that there should be an increase in the expenditure ceiling allocated for agriculture in Budget 2013 in line with the level of employment created by the agricultural sector.  Where savings must be found, these cannot be from the farm schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352976300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bryan.

I concur with the Chairman that it is critical that Ireland secures an agreement on the Common Agricultural Policy that maintains the allocation at its current level.  Achieving this objective would still entail a reduction in real terms of 6% or 7%.  Political volatility across Europe and elements of the domestic agenda in certain countries, including imminent elections, are putting severe pressure on the CAP budget.  The joint committee must support the Minister in making every effort at the Council of Ministers and in the European Parliament to secure an agreement on the budget as quickly as possible.  If this issue is allowed to fester, it may not be good news as CAP expenditure accounts for a large proportion of the overall European Union budget.<\/p><p>  While European expenditure may be a debate for another day, the allocation for agriculture at domestic level is within the control of the Minister.  I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Bryan on the need to protect agriculture in so far as possible.  We all know that cuts are necessary given that we are in an adjustment programme, the country is in a difficult economic position and a significant gap between revenue and expenditure remains.  As Mr. Bryan noted, cuts of &euro;114 million or 8% are earmarked for the agricultural budget next year.  We should not cut the budget by this level.  While the Minister must contend with Government colleagues at Cabinet level as they examine areas where cuts could be made, it should be noted, as demonstrated by the findings of an IFA commissioned report, that all moneys expended by the State in agriculture are reinvested in the economy.<\/p><p>  At a meeting of the joint committee yesterday, members had a good discussion with the Minister during which they suggested areas where expenditure could be reduced and other areas where it must be protected.  All political parties agree that we must protect the schemes to which Mr. Bryan referred, in particular, the disadvantaged areas and suckler cow welfare schemes.  The IFA was to the fore in highlighting last year that proposed changes to the disadvantaged areas scheme would not work.  It has been proved correct.  The allocation for the scheme last year was &euro;190 million compared with &euro;222 million in the previous year.  By the end of October this year, however, &euro;186 million had been paid out and this figure will increase as adjudications are reached in the appeals process.  The reason the Department's proposals did not work was that we had derogations and an appeals mechanism.  Yesterday, a member of the joint committee suggested increasing stocking rates on better land as a means of reducing expenditure on the scheme.  What is Mr. Bryan's view on that proposal?<\/p><p>  Many farmers will exit the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, in 2014, which will be a major issue.  While I hope this issue will be addressed in the Common Agricultural Policy, it is not yet clear if that will be the case given the uncertainty about the new programme.  I had hoped more places would be made available under the new agri-environment options scheme and that the allocation for the scheme would have been higher.  Despite its difficulties, however, we at least have a scheme in place.  The deadline for submission of applications must be extended until at least the end of the year in light of the difficulties emerging with commonage.  The joint committee raised this issue with the Minister yesterday and was given an assurance that he would not issue letters until the matter had been discussed with members and he had consulted farming organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500011#K00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352976900,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives and congratulate the IFA as its meetings around the country were informative, constructive and contributed to the debate on the CAP.<\/p><p>  The representatives referred to the expenditure ceilings in place.  Perhaps they might be examined in line with the employment created on a performance-related basis, which is an interesting point.  Obviously, we disagree with the fact that the expenditure ceilings do not take account of EU funds.  We feel disenfranchised in that regard and that position will not be corrected overnight, but putting in place a performance based model would be progressive.  That is a welcome idea which we certainly will push further.  <\/p><p>  Discussion groups on the grain and sheep sectors are absolutely vital.  Last week we launched a document on the tillage industry, a copy of which can be made available to the representatives if they are interested.  It is all about increasing performance and production levels as efficiently as possible.  Certainly having discussion groups would be a good starting point.  In my early days in farming I found such groups helpful, not only in seeking to improve one's performance but also socially as they linked individuals.  <\/p><p>  Land mobility is critical.  Where there is fragmentation, anything that can be done must be considered.  <\/p><p>  We need to arrive at a solution to the problem of active and non-active farmers.  The Chairman may be tired of listening to me saying this.  During the boom times hobby farmers were able to take their animals to the mart and if they broke even, it was not a problem, whereas the person who was trying to earn a living could not compete.  We need to start looking at commercial farmers once again, irrespective of the scale one is at.  That farmers are signing up to receive their single farm payment and renting the land is unacceptable.  This is happening, but the matter is being brushed under the carpet.  That is the biggest penalty imposed on many farmers and I am determined to have the issue discussed.  Something must be done and I want a solution to it to be found.  <\/p><p>  The food security issue will become more pressing.  The cost of food kept the rate of inflation down in the past.  When I ceased producing milk in 1991, the price was around 28 cent per litre; it is still around that level.  When the spring bursts, the price of food will increase and the consumer will not thank us.  All of the messing with the CAP means people are taking their eye off the ball and there could be a food crisis.  Weather patterns around the world make this clear.  However, they have been warned and should stop playing politics on the issue.  It is not good enough.  <\/p><p>  I listened to the comments on inspections.  Perhaps a common database is needed for inspectors, as there is no point in council, departmental and other inspectors tripping over one another on farms.  We are living in the computer age.  One should be able to check on one's iPhone who previously carried out an inspection.  There is no point in repeating a job done by someone else.  <\/p><p>  I am not comfortable with overdoing staff cuts.  While we are in difficulty and there are cutbacks to be made, that will not always be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500012#L00200","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352977500,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I welcome the IFA president and his delegation, my former colleagues.  We are delighted to have them here again.  We are coming up to a crucial time and are aware difficult decisions must be made.  I am at one with and agree wholeheartedly with what has been said.  It is very important the suckler cow scheme is maintained.  For those of us in the west who have been producing sucklers and getting reasonably good prices for weanlings over the past couple of years, it is vital the scheme remains in place.  As well as helping farmers, the scheme has done a lot for the quality of the animals.  Animals exported or those finished off here in Ireland are now better quality animals and produce better prices, which is good.  Therefore, we will certainly work with farmers to ensure the scheme is kept in place.<\/p><p>  Teagasc and ICBF have run the scheme and discussion groups, as mentioned by Deputy Barry in the context of the tillage sector.  It is very good for farmers to get out and learn from fellow farmers and gain experience in that way.  I agree it is also very important to keep the disadvantaged area scheme in place.  An attempt was made to save some money in this area last year, but it might as well have been left alone.  We spoke briefly about commonage earlier, which is a serious problem.  At one of the meetings yesterday, somebody suggested that where farmers within a commonage area wanted to sell land by way of another inter-commonage sale, it should be exempt from capital gains tax or stamp duty.  The suggestion was there should be no tax payable where one farmer wanted to sell a share of commonage to another.  This might be a way of getting around the problem.  Whatever we do, the issue must be dealt with as it causes serious problems.  It has been dragging on for a number of years and many commonages are undergrazed and others are overgrazed.<\/p><p>  With regard to the environment, it is important to maintain an environmental scheme.  We have the AEOS, but it is not nearly as good as the old REP scheme.  Hopefully, after the CAP negotiations, we will be in a position to put a better scheme in place.  We will continue to work on this.  Support for younger farmers is also crucial.  On inspections, I am aware that in Leitrim alone some 100 files have been returned.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned that inspectors were out in Donegal.  In the small county of Leitrim, some 100 files were returned and farmers were not paid.  Approximately 26% of people have not been paid and as soon as I finish here, I must go and make calls to try to get some of these problems sorted out.  We would all agree that it is not acceptable for inspectors to be coming out at this time of year carrying out inspections on land, as the money should be coming out to farmers now.  These inspections should have been carried out earlier and throughout the summer.<\/p><p>  We would all be aware that any time money comes into farmers' pockets, they go off to the local towns and villages to shop.  Even if they only buy a gate or a wheelbarrow or do a bit of shopping, they spend their money, which is beneficial to the local economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500013#M00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1352977500,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me contribute.  I feel like a refugee at the committee.  I welcome Mr. Bryan and the IFA delegation.  Every issue raised here, not just by the IFA but by other farm organisations also, has a common thread.  We recognise the arguments made on the value of the farm schemes in terms of turnover and added economic benefit, not just to farm families but to local economies, rural and urban.  We do farmers a disservice when we suggest the economic benefits of these schemes apply just to local rural economies.<\/p><p>  As the Chairman pointed out, it is important to take on board the bigger issues facing the State in the wider European context.  I was glad to hear Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill say we need to don the green jersey on this.  While we all have our own battles to fight in the game, the country must come first.  This hearing will help to highlight the importance of getting what we can in the European context.  We must at least try to maintain an overall envelope in the multiannual financial framework that must be agreed.  We would support everything that can be done in that regard.<\/p><p>  I do not want to repeat what previous speakers have said.  Obviously, I agree with most of it.  However, sometimes we must look beyond the submission made.  Senator Comiskey touched on the issue of the commonage framework plan.  While this is not something that is an immediate problem, it is an issue we must deal with.  Perhaps it is not for this budget discussion, but it is an issue that must be taken on board.  Otherwise, Irish farmers face a potential European penalty - perhaps a 10% clawback.  That is not in anybody's interest, so the issue must be dealt with.<\/p><p>  The main issue I want to raise is a bit out of left field.  The trend of Mr. Bryan's submission was maintenance and the need to hold what we have.  There is an issue with this as it is proposed to remove &euro;114 million from the agricultural Vote.  Therefore, it will be difficult to hold what we have.  Nowadays, Departments, agencies, farmers and staff all use the phrase \"doing more for less\".  There is no point in them coming in and making a submission seeking to maintain everything as it is.  However, there is one particular area where a small group of people and farm families would benefit from doing more for less, namely, in the area of aquaculture.  I urge the farming representatives to include in their submissions proposals to enhance, support and develop the aquaculture industry, particularly along the western seaboard.  The people who would benefit from doing more for less in this area would be farmers or people working in farm families.  The development of this industry would help to supplement their incomes.<\/p><p>  This industry is underdeveloped currently.  I am aware the issue is mentioned in the submission document and am aware Mr. Flynn advocates progressive development.  This is not just an IFA issue, but is a Department, State and general public issue.  For an island nation, we have an appalling record in the area of aquaculture.  Development of this area will not solve all our problems, but for people along the western seaboard, it is an option that should be discussed.  I would welcome more engagement, support and development in this area.  I do not want to go on about this, but It is an area that is not discussed enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500013#M00300","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352977500,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I shall start with the questions raised by Deputy Harrington.  His comments on agriculture are in line with ours.<\/p> <p>We see agriculture and food production - whether it is forestry, aquaculture, the suckler herd, or dairying - as critical in creating employment.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and Deputy Barry that the potential of agriculture is underestimated.  Glanbia is planning to build an enormous processing centre in south Kilkenny and agriculture can provide countless jobs in the next few years.  However, we must sustain the jobs on the farms.  On the issue of the &euro;114 million budget, savings have been made already.  The fact that the REPS payments and early retirement payments are running out means that &euro;40 million can be saved.  There have been staff redundancies this year also and there is probably somewhere between &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million in savings achieved already.  <\/p><p> As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, the Government will have to look at areas they did not look at the last time.  Last year the Department disproportionately hit the farm schemes.  I have urged the Minister to ring fence the farm schemes and look to other areas for savings.  I do not think that is unreasonable because some of the other areas were not touched last year.  I am not saying I want to touch anything but if the Minister has to make savings he should stay away from the schemes because they are critical to employment.  He should look at the other areas.<\/p><p> When I am finished, I will ask Mr. McCarthy to say a few words on the commonage framework plans.  The IFA takes the attitude that while something has to be done, the plans were rushed.  We do not hold with collective responsibility, for example.  If one holds with collective responsibility then if someone in this room commits a crime it means we should all be locked up.  That is unreasonable and unfair and we cannot accept it.  I agree with Senator Comiskey that something must be done on the commonage plans.  Perhaps exempting them from capital gains is an option as there would be no loss of revenue in that.  A broader approach is definitely needed.   <\/p><p> Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Comiskey both referred to the savings that were to be made in the less favoured areas, LFA, schemes last year.  We said to the Minister at the time that exemptions had to be applied for those who were in special areas of conservation, natural heritage areas, those with commonage framework plans and those in environmental schemes.  When all of that was factored in, the total was never going to drop below &euro;220 million.  At the time, we felt that if a stocking density was to be introduced, there should be three different levels.  There should be one level for the hill, another for the more severely handicapped land and yet another for the less severely handicapped land.  One should never apply the same stocking rate on a hill as on less severely handicapped land.  There may be some technical problems with that but sometimes one must take the more complicated route to arrive at a solution.  Having the same stocking rate on the top of a hill as on less favoured areas is not appropriate.  The IFA believes that different stocking levels for different areas is the way to go.<\/p><p> During meetings we have held all over the country we got the clear message that there are many farmers who are working very hard and who want to sustain jobs but they are very dependent on pillar 1 or pillar 2 funding and any major change in distribution will have serious consequences for them.  The proposed savage cuts in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, across pillar 1 and pillar 2 will create enormous problems.  The Baltic states, Romania and Bulgaria are seriously below the EU average at the moment and no-one thinks they will take a cut.  Therefore, if there is a cut, it will hit countries like Ireland, which are close to the average, far harder.  It would a very serious impact.  <\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Barry that at a time of tightening resources, we must distinguish clearly between active and inactive farmers.  There is no way we can be all things to all men every day.  We cannot say that someone who has made a decision to give up farming should still get his or her single farm payment, disadvantaged area payment or any other payment.  We must be very clear in our support for active farmers.  <\/p><p> On the issue of land mobility the IFA has a very reasonable proposal that the sale of land which is being transferred for active farming be exempt from capital gains tax.  There is no loss of revenue involved because a farmer will simply not sell a field if he or she has to pay capital gains tax.  We have done some work on this and it would be revenue neutral but would facilitate a reduction in parcel numbers.  <\/p><p> The IFA believes that the Ciolo&amp;#537; proposals do not take any account of food security, which is the biggest threat facing the world.  The world population is expected to grow from 7 billion to 9 billion, which is a real threat, both to food and water supplies.  The water resources in Australia, North America and France are already under severe pressure.  Food production in Europe is vital and that is what is missing in the current CAP reform proposals.  The CAP budget was reduced from &euro;1.33 billion to &euro;1.24 billion.  If another 10% is taken out, that equates to &euro;200 million less before one even starts.  We have already had modular and other cuts so the stance the Government takes on the MFF negotiations is vital.  Just because David Cameron jumps up, the whole of Europe cannot tremble and agree to cut one of the strongest pillars of the EU.  It is essential that countries such as Ireland, France and Germany tell Mr. Cameron to roll back a bit.  <\/p><p> The domestic budget is under the Cabinet's control.  As I said to Deputy Harrington with regard to the &euro;114 million, we have already hit the agricultural schemes so now it is time to look at other areas.  It will not be easy to find savings but some areas lost 0.5% or 1% last year, while the schemes lost 17%.  Given the employment potential in agriculture, cuts of 8% are too high.  Schemes like REPS and AEOS are absolutely essential.  There are a lot of farmers who are in receipt of small single farm payments of between &euro;7,000 and &euro;8,000 and getting an additional &euro;4,000 under AEOS makes an enormous difference to them.  <\/p><p> Regarding the issue of penalties, if someone is in my yard, I must treat him or her with respect and dignity and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Spend a week in a man's yard and one will see a lot.  If someone is sick, even more care is required.   I was aware of a case in Kilkenny where an inspection was due to take place but the farmer was suffering from depression at the time.  When I rang the Department, the inspection was postponed.   Depression is a common thing in rural Ireland, especially with isolation and that must be borne in mind by the Department.  Inspectors should be trained in how to deal with people and how to have a compassionate and understanding attitude.  If they are in doubt, they should cancel the inspection and come back another day because they do not know the pressures that people are under on the ground.<\/p><p> Redeployment of staff could yield some savings, as would other measures, but I would be very conscious, in redeploying staff, of the need to protect frontline staff, whether they are in Teagasc, Bord Bia or other essential areas.  I would prefer to see redeployment within the Department itself rather than in the frontline services.  I will now hand over to Mr. McCarthy who will deal with the commonage framework plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500013#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352978100,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I wish to take up one point raised by Deputy Barry, namely, the issue of fairness.  As farmers see it, the cuts being made to the agricultural envelope are disproportionate.  A cut of 8% versus 3% is simply unacceptable.  The evidence shows that farmers have taken considerable cuts to all of their schemes in recent years and in the context of the overall amount of money given by the Exchequer to agriculture, we are back to 2000 levels or earlier.  The president referred to a farmer earning &euro;20,000.  As a self-employed person he or she is paying 19% in taxes and charges, versus 10% for PAYE workers, because the farmer does not have an allowance.  The farmer must also pay the extra carbon taxes and extra VAT, while his or her family suffers the same way as every other family in society through the reduction in services.  This year the farmer's income will be down by between 20% and 30% and in some cases more - depending on the type of farming - because of bad weather and increased costs.  I urge members to remember the word fairness as I speak.  The Government is arguing that something must be cut and the Department is intending to go after the schemes again.  Farmers, like everyone else, will have to find the extra money to pay the property tax and whatever else is introduced in the budget.  There is a tipping point and it has been reached.  Farmers have already taken cuts and the disproportionality of those cuts must be addressed at the Cabinet table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Flor McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352978700,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Do you wish to comment on the commonage framework plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500015#O00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352978700,"counter":55,"content":"<p>It has created major problems along the western seaboard.  We have been in negotiations for six or seven months.  We have made the case at six or seven meetings but they have made no changes.  The proposal made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, yesterday involving the introduction of an independent chairman was welcome.  We have said that the collective agreement is totally unworkable.  We were informed there would be a major gap between the minimum and maximum but we did not realise anything until the proposals were published, even though we were at the meetings.  The proposal published and what was explained to us were totally different.  We must have been attending totally different meetings.<\/p><p>  The reaction on the ground has been very negative.  Individual farmers with 200 sheep may have to reduce their numbers to 46 again.  It is a total shambles.  There is no way the document in question can be negotiated or changed.  I welcome the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to bring in an independent chairman and to begin afresh.  We accept without a doubt that something must be done on commonages but the proposals brought forward in the past week are not workable.  The collective agreement does not make sense.  One man doing his job right should not be penalised because one or two others are doing it wrong.  At the same time we will support the scheme, even if it is not totally what we want.  The IFA is a reasonable organisation and if the scheme is in any way reasonable we will go with it, but the reaction has been savage and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has got it from his backbench Deputies.  They are not hyping it up for nothing.  There is a major problem.<\/p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill commented on the inspections.  They are also a major issue in the west.  Many inspections are rather subjective.  Inspectors come to eligible ground and decide certain people's ground has rushes on it.  Three of us could visit the same farm and come out with three different opinions.  It is not black and white.  I know of a farmer in Kerry who faced an inspection in 2010 and received a 5% reduction in eligible ground.  An inspection was carried out again this year and he was informed that he will receive a 100% penalty.  There were two inspectors and he was inspected in both years.  I could take the view that the inspector from this year was wrong and that the inspector who took off 5% two years ago was right.  The farmer expected a 5% reduction in his eligible ground.  There should be some way of assessing some of these individuals.  Some people are giving 100% penalties.  The work of these people should be examined.  They are picking on weak individuals working and farming on their own.  All these farmers are bachelors.  Perhaps their situation has slipped somewhat but a 50% penalty would be savage.  Many people are facing 100% penalties and that cannot be condoned.  These people are in peripheral areas.  The whole inspection system should be examined.  Some compassion should be shown because, as the president said, there are issues relating to depression, sickness, old age and various family circumstances.<\/p><p>  Many of these people are only barely getting used to the numbers from the reference year.  This is the type of terrain they farmed in 2000, 2001 and 2002 from which they established their entitlements.  It is not as if there has been a major shift.  This was always poor ground and it will always be poor ground.  The 100% penalties are occurring in areas close to the shore where the climate is warmer and more encouraging.  There is not as much higher bush growth in these areas.  Obviously, it is poorer land as well and that should be taken into consideration.  We welcome the support of the committee members and we all accept that there must be inspections, but inspections where people face 100% penalties cannot be condoned.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to aquaculture and wind energy.  There are difficulties facing all of these schemes and with special areas of conservation, SAC, designations.  Up to now these were okay because we were compensated for them.  At this stage a new look should be taken at the designations because the farmers concerned are having restrictions placed on them.  The same applies to aquaculture.  Those involved cannot be grant aided if they operate in a SAC or in a proposed natural heritage area, NHA.  These are real issues.<\/p><p>  I come from an area where there has been a good deal of wind farming and it is disappointing for us that all wind developments seem to be moving to the midlands solely because we are restricted by designations.  We have a better asset than those in the midlands but we are losing out because of designations.  At this stage the designations are a nail in the coffin for us.<\/p><p>  It was not as bad under REPS 4 and we were able to get reasonable compensation.  I have raised this matter with the Minister as well with regard to disadvantaged area payments, REPS and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  Up to 70% of the funding for these schemes comes from Europe and that should be recognised in the general kitty.  The onus is on Deputies to recognise that this money is coming from Europe and that there should be a commitment to the AEOS.  If there are 8,000 applicants for the scheme they should all be paid.<\/p><p>  There is an attack on the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The scheme has been in place since the 1970s.  It is a second generation scheme and it is a real support for people.  There will be a vicious reaction if it is attacked.  I am the second generation to draw down the disadvantaged area payment.  Rightly or wrongly people may believe they are entitled to it but if there is any attack on it at this stage there will be problems.  Years ago the payment was IR&pound;7,000 but the criteria under which it was paid changed.  It was moved over to a land based system and this brought a reduction for the genuine people who were benefiting from it.  It is at the stage now where we are only getting &euro;3,300.  Any attack on that limit will be met with a vicious reaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111500015#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Flor McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1352978700,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the committee members and Mr. Bryan and his colleagues.

The IFA may have referred to the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the bioenergy scheme and the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT.  These and other taxation measures are probably areas that will be easier to secure agreement with the Government and with the Minister in particular.  This may not necessarily be the case with all Departments but certainly with some.  The Minister outlined some of the proposals he has submitted to the Department of Finance with regard to taxation measures.  These concur a good deal with the comments of the deputation.  No doubt an evaluation will be done and, for example, in the case of the AEOS, the people who are in genuine need are protected.  This was the thrust of the effort last year.  Perhaps it did not work as well as expected but the effort was to try to protect them and to ensure that those who were availing of it when they had no real need of it are made to be active.

Mr. Gleeson will speak of the scale of the problem we all face and will go through our report.  However, beforehand I will give a brief background.  Retail Ireland is the national representative body for the entire sector.  We represent international and national department stores, DIY outlets, electrical retailers, fashion and footwear retailers, the supermarkets, symbol groups and a range of specialist retailers.  We are a division of IBEC and through that connection we also have close links with the Small Firms Association, which represents a number of small and independent retailers.<\/p><p>  Retail crime is a serious problem and comes against a backdrop of a serious situation in the industry.  Retail has had a very difficult few years, with sales down by one-third.  The sectors experiencing the largest declines include furniture and lighting and the motor trade, which are down 50% and hardware and electrical goods which are down 40%.  Some 50,000 retail jobs have been lost in the past few years and, unfortunately, growth is unlikely in the short term.   <\/p><p>  However, there is some good news in the sector.  The retail sector still employs more than 250,000 people and is the largest employer in the country.  We have a presence in every town in the land, bar none and the sector is a huge purchaser of Irish goods and products.  The retail sector accounts for over 10% of GDP and almost 15% of total employment.  I would like to stress also that we are an industry of small, indigenous businesses.  Some 86% of retail businesses have fewer than ten employees and a similar number, 86%, are Irish owned. <\/p><p>  It is against this background of a struggling but economically vital industry that Retail Ireland commissioned EPS Consulting and the report&rsquo;s author, Peter Brennan, to collate from various sources data that shows in one place for the first time the scale of the problem of the black market and retail crime in this country.  The report is solutions driven.  We are not simply coming to the committee with a list of complaints.  We make a series of proposals that we believe will help to combat the problem.  Some of these proposals are cost neutral, but some will require State investment.  However, any investment will see a return to the State many times greater than that initial spend. <\/p><p>  I will now hand over to our chairman, Mr. Frank Gleeson, who will discuss the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Lynam"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352973600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the committee this morning.  As a practising retailer, this business is close to my heart.  Topaz operates more than 120 stores directly, with 1,500 employees, and we also supply 220 independent retailers.  I get to see the problem every day of the week and live the issues daily.  Therefore, I may be quite emotional about this presentation today.<br \/> The black market needs to be tackled, not just because of the jobs in the retail sector, as outlined by Mr. Lynam, but because of the dangers that criminal gangs pose to communities throughout the country and the huge levels of revenue that are lost to the State through illegal black market activity.  This revenue is also lost to retailers and communities.  Our report estimates that the State loses approximately &euro;4 billion over a five-year period due to the black market in cigarettes, fuel, alcohol and counterfeit goods, through digital piracy and through shoplifting and theft.  This is equivalent to almost 6% of PAYE collected and enriches the leaders of organised criminal gangs who do nothing to improve life in our towns and cities. <\/p><p>  Members will see in the report details of the various categories of the black market.  I will run through these briefly, starting with the illicit fuel trade, an area I am aware of on a day to day basis.  Currently, fuel for off-road use is taxed at a lower rate; the price differential between the two types of diesel, green diesel and normal road diesel, is approximately 51.6 cent.  Diesel used other than as auto-diesel has a special dye added to it to differentiate it from diesel to be used by motorists.  The price differential acts as an incentive for criminal elements to launder the fuel and remove the dye.  The illegal fuel trade is costing the Exchequer some &euro;155 million in lost taxes every year.  We estimate that approximately 12% of all diesel sold in Ireland is illegal.  Much has been done to alleviate this problem, but more can be done.  We need to intensify inspection levels and introduce more punitive penalties.  Retail Ireland also supports a rebate scheme to farmers that has the potential to almost eliminate the problem, because once there is a cash differential, there is always a temptation for criminals to find their way around the dye problem.<\/p><p>  There is a serious and increasing problem with illegal tobacco in Ireland.  Retail Ireland supports the Government's aim of reducing smoking prevalence in the adult population and encouraging younger people not to take up the habit in the first place.  However, where there is a demand for tobacco, that demand should be met through the legitimate retail chain I represent here today.  Unfortunately, Irish criminal gangs are making approximately &euro;3 million a week in selling illegal cigarettes.  The price of illegal cigarettes has fallen from &euro;4 a packet to as low as &euro;3.20.  When we compare this to the current recommended price at which legitimate retailers sell cigarettes, nearly &euro;9 - taxation accounts for almost 80% of the price - there is a significant loss to both the Exchequer and to retailers through additional sales.  People do not just buy cigarettes, but buy milk and bread and other items on which our small corner shops rely.  This is a small store issue rather than a big multinational store issue.  Therefore, it is important to understand that 85% of retail in Ireland is small stores and Irish owned.  Therefore, this hurts communities.<\/p><p>  We believe criminal gangs are making approximately &euro;3 million, which is a significant windfall for them.  It is estimated that the legitimate cigarette market has shrunk from 6.7 billion in 2000 to 4.3 billion cigarettes in 2010, with no commensurate drop in smoking prevalence rates.  Industry sources suggest that approximately 1.8 billion of cigarettes smoked in Ireland are sourced from the black market.  To combat the problem, we recommend that excise duties be frozen so that there is no further widening in the price between legal and illegal cigarettes.  We also believe there should be increased investment in detecting cigarette smuggling.  Crucially, the sale of any tobacco products at a market or fair should be banned.  To this end, penalties available under the Casual Trading Act 1995 should be made as strict as those which exist under the Finance Acts.<\/p><p>  While smuggled alcohol is not a significant problem in comparison with illegal fuel or tobacco, smuggled alcohol is a growing problem.  Our report states that seizures of counterfeit alcohol rose from 252 litres in 2010 to 1,309 litres last year.  Industry sources put the figure much higher, with some 44,276 litres of alcohol seized during 2010 in 287 different raids.  The value of this was approximately &euro;600,000 to the Exchequer.  Recent seizures of alcohol in the UK showed the products <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">contained an industrial solvent, commonly found in nail varnish remover and screen wash. <\/font>  Europol, the European police agency, stated that in a recent case in Turkey, 23 people died when they consumed alcohol that contained very high levels of methyl alcohol.<\/p><p>  The issue of counterfeit goods is huge.  The OECD estimates that fake goods seized by customs at borders amount to some $250 billion a year.  The International Chamber of Commerce put the figure higher at $600 billion.  The main fake product categories which customers knowingly purchase include clothing, 27%; watches, 15%; and perfumes, 13%.  Consumers are aware that such purchases damage domestic businesses and affect Exchequer revenues.  In Ireland, according to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, clothing is the most common item produced and sold by counterfeiters, with individual items being produced in the Far East at a cost often as low as 50 cent per garment.  I regret to have to say that poison in children's clothing is the latest risk emerging from counterfeiters.  A recent investigation found formaldehyde in woollen and cotton clothes that was 500 times higher than recommended safe levels. <\/p><p>  There are other areas of the black market we could also touch on.  Digital piracy is a very big issue and I understand the committee will be hearing from Xtravision, a Retail Ireland member, at meetings in Kilkenny and Waterford next week, where the committee will learn more and can engage with Peter O'Grady-Walshe who can explain how difficult this issue is for him and his business. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352974200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its time.

I do not intend to repeat it.  I wish to speak briefly about my current involvement with Risk Management International, RMI, which is an independent international risk management service provider.  We have many prominent clients in the retail, fuel, tobacco and clothing industries, including Philip Morris International.  RMI is Ireland's largest independent risk management service provider.  We offer a portfolio of risk-related services to enable clients to manage risks with greater confidence.  We hope to help our clients solve a variety of problems that typically fall outside the scope of conventional mainstream business activities.  RMI is the largest shareholder in React UK, which is the largest brand protection service provider in the UK for luxury goods.  Since earlier this year, RMI has been operating a website, <i>whistleblowerconfidential.ie<\/i>, the purpose of which is to make confidential reporting work for concerned persons with truthful information.  Since the beginning of this year, the service been generating notifications to organisations at risk, including banks, corporate entities and State agencies.  Those reports generally relate to corporate fraud and assets put beyond the reach of creditors.  The whistleblower service has generated intelligence and information that have led to major finds by law enforcement agencies.  A recent find was one of the largest in the history of the State.<\/p><p>  I will skip over the section of my presentation that sets out my CV, as the committee has heard it already.  My expertise relates to the criminality surrounding the black market, rather than the economic issues highlighted by previous speakers.  I will focus on this element of the matter under discussion in the first instance by providing some facts and information on what is known by the authorities at home and abroad about criminal involvement in the black market and retail crime.  I will be happy to answer any questions as best I can after I have concluded.  There are huge sums of money to be made from the black market.  This explains its attractiveness to criminals and subversives.  It is all about money and profit.  Many of those behind the major cigarette smuggling and fuel laundering operations in this country are linked to defunct and active subversive organisations.  Members will be aware that a new IRA faction, which has seemingly resulted from a merger of existing disparate dissident groups, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the recent murder of a prison officer, Mr. David Black, on the M1 road to Belfast.  A report published last month by the US Congress, citing that country's Department of Homeland Security, listed the Real IRA, Hizbollah and Hamas as global terrorist groups that are financed through the illicit tobacco trade.  The 2012 cross-Border organised crime assessment prepared by the Department of Justice and Equality and its counterpart in Northern Ireland in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI stated that dissident republicans are generating significant sums of money from fuel laundering and tobacco smuggling.<\/p><p>  We know from our history that smuggling is not new to Ireland.  When I was in Derrynane a few years ago - it is not Golden Vale country - I wondered how the Liberator, Daniel O'Connell, had such a nice lifestyle and was able to be educated at home and abroad.  I discovered that his ancestors engaged in the smuggling of wine from Spain.  I think the Smugglers' Inn and the Smugglers' Cove are to be found in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500004#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Hickey"},{"type":"speech","time":1352974200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>He got his education from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500004#C00700","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352974200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>When I checked it further, I learned that the Liberator did not know anything about smuggling.

It has reached a different level at the moment.  The most recent Europol organised crime threat assessment, in May 2011, highlighted that Ireland is a \"preferred destination\" within the EU for cigarette smuggling because we have the second highest retail price for cigarettes in Europe.  As the price charged here is four times higher than that charged in many other member states, Ireland is seen as a lucrative market for the illegal trade.  I believe that 10,000 cigarettes can be bought in Dubai for as little as &euro;30.  By selling 200 of them for &euro;60 in this country, one can make a profit of &euro;3,000 on a small shipment.  Apparently, a container of cigarettes can be bought and shipped from China for &euro;300,000 and generate potential resales of &euro;5 million.  Some 120 million cigarettes, valued at &euro;500 million, were seized at Greenore Port in County Louth in 2009.  This haul has been traced to the Philippines.  It was the largest seizure of its kind in Europe.  A criminal syndicate of former subversives and smugglers who are active in the Border region was reported to be behind the haul.  Officers from the customs division of the Revenue Commissioners, assisted by garda&iacute;, uncovered two oil-laundering plants in County Louth three weeks ago.  One of the plants, which was near Hackballscross, had the capacity to launder 18 million litres of fuel per annum, with a potential loss to the Exchequer of &euro;9 million per annum.  Officers also discovered 36 tonnes of toxic waste and a shebeen on the premises.  They seized spirits on which no duty had been paid.  Two men from Northern Ireland and a man with an address in County Louth were arrested at the scene.  RMI provided critical information to the law enforcement personnel involved in this instance.<\/p><p>  Having spoken to law enforcement officers internationally over quite a while, I understand that some traffickers throughout Europe who had started to use existing cigarette routes for the transit of drugs have reverted to cigarettes because the global economic downturn has meant there is a lesser market for substances such as cocaine.  There is less risk involved because a different attitude is taken in the case of cigarette smuggling.  If smugglers are arrested, the penalties are lax.  In Ireland, the mandatory sentencing threshold for drug traffickers is ten years.  We will speak later about the penalties and sanctions that are in use for cigarette smugglers.  There is anecdotal evidence in this regard.  When we were investigating the Gilligan gang, we discovered that the truckers and couriers used in the early stages started life as smugglers and couriers of truckloads of cigarettes.  Some of the people who were working for the gang as bagmen handling money convinced themselves and their families that they were smuggling cigarettes, even though they knew deep down that cannabis and cocaine were the actual substances being transported.  For the past 20 years, people in other countries who have been involved in shipments of drugs, including cannabis, have thrown in sweeteners such as a few automatic pistols and, in some cases, sub-machine guns.  I have no evidence that this has happened in the case of cigarette smugglers.  I mention it to illustrate the type of thing we are dealing with.  Having interviewed smugglers, I know that the rationale they use is \"If we did not do it, somebody else would\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500004#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Hickey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352974800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Hickey would deal now with some of the policy solutions as we must move on.

The investment in tackling the black market should be benchmarked proportionally against the revenue being lost to the State.  Every additional &euro;1 million invested in resources to tackle the black market will result in savings to the State of &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million, a reduction in direct Exchequer losses, money that will provide surplus savings that are quantifiable and a reduction in an essential source of revenue for subversive gangland criminals and, on the face of it, value for money.<\/p><p>  Another specific policy proposal of how to apply these resources, as covered already by Retail Ireland, is that of whistleblowing.  This country has a chequered history in terms of informants and information.  However, as instanced in the not too distant past people will give information if they are paid to do so.  As well as these specific measures, politicians must be vigilant of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned public policy measures such as excise duty increases and so on.  Finally, our legislators should reflect on the use of resources.  When one looks at the statistics in regard to the number of inspections carried out of newsagents, smoke free zones and so on by and large compliance is high.  I learned a great deal about budgets in a previous role.  However, that was at a time when we had more money.  Budgets and money are always difficult issues.  Resources must be deployed where crime levels are higher.  It is illogical that there is so much effort being put into policing smoke free zones and newsagents as opposed to the traffickers and smugglers.<\/p><p>  Without labouring the point, I served in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a time when more than 600 people were killed on the roads in this country.  Through education, law enforcement, legislation and penalty points, there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of people killed on our roads, although even one death is one too many.  The deployment of additional resources to tackle the illegal cigarette market and diesel trade would be self financing and, probably, profitable through a reduction of sales which avoid taxation and would be proportionate in terms of balancing public health objectives and reducing crime. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Hickey"},{"type":"speech","time":1352974800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hickey for his presentation and apologise for cutting him short.

We are all agreed that the black market undermines our domestic economy, costs jobs and has implications for workers' rights, which I will explain later.  It also costs lives.  Mr. Hickey made the point that there is a connection between the black market, criminality, drug gangs and gun crime.  This problem needs to be eradicated.  It is important that resources are put in place to do so.<\/p><p>  For me the core issue is tax compliance.  It is important all individuals and companies are tax compliant.  Those operating in the black market do not pay tax.  It is in this area that some of the energy, in terms of resources, needs to be targeted.  When there is an unlevel playing field, with some companies and people involved in smuggling and so on not paying taxes, this has implications for legitimate businesses which do pay their taxes.  It is true to say that some companies are involved in the black market in terms of not paying their employees' PRSI contributions, which means employees are in turn not protected in terms of their benefits.  This impacts on competing companies resulting in their having to cut costs which, in turn, impacts on employees.  The black market impacts not alone on the economy, which is important, but on workers.<\/p><p>  We must be innovative in how we address this issue.  Mr. Hickey hinted at one way we could address the issue of fuel smuggling.  There is no doubt that we need to deal with the criminal element of this.  I agree with intensifying inspections and the introduction of more punitive penalties and so on.  However, perhaps harmonisation of taxes across the island could also be considered.  Working with our counterparts in the Assembly in the North we could pull the rug from under those people engaged in fuel smuggling.  As also mentioned by Mr. Hickey, while we need to address the issue of supply and sale we also need to address the issue of demand, which is a big issue.  There are people who will buy illegal goods, including cigarettes and other contraband items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500005#D00700","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352975400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Where the report details the impact on jobs in a fragile economy, it draws attention to the significance of what is happening and the absolute necessity to tackle the issue more effectively.  It is almost a self-inflicted injury to the economy.  I want to put the issue in perspective by asking Mr. Hickey a question about the modern origins and dynamic of smuggling and the financial implications for the country.  There has always been smuggling along the Border, but the traditional form of smuggling is now part of romantic folklore.  On the origins of the current phase, I am firmly of the view that the key authors were the paramilitaries, including the Provisional IRA.  Obviously, the problem has spread, but it is very important to understand the origins of something if one is tackle it and call it by its proper name.  Am I accurate in suggesting this is not old style smuggling, that it is qualitatively a different activity that has its origins in a particular time in modern history and involves the contextual presence of paramilitaries who are the parents of this phenomenon?  I would like to get Mr. Hickey's angle.  If we are trying to tackle something, we have to look at its origins and the dynamic to find whether it has changed.  Obviously, it has because other categories of criminal have become involved.  It is important that we try to find the original source and understand the dynamic.<\/p><p>  I tabled a question to the Minister on fuel laundering and suggested a rebate to farmers on ordinary diesel, for example, would be a much tidier way of dealing with the issue and that it would undermine the dynamic of this category of illegal activity.  The Minister's reply was that it would be too expensive.  However, the expense involved in not tackling it by new methods is far greater and incalculable in terms of, for example, the increase in crime.  I urge the committee to ask the Minister or one of his staff to come to deal with this issue, as there are more clever ways of dealing with the threat.  Having a fragile economy is one thing, but these are self-inflicted injuries to the economy.  We need to address the issue.<\/p><p>  With regard to the figures in the report concerning tobacco, the Revenue Commissioners seem to have a different figure.  The Retail Ireland figures seem to range to about 24%, while the Revenue Commissioners have a figure of 14%.  It has been mentioned by the Irish Cancer Society that these figures have been deliberately inflated - I am using its language, not mine - or perhaps overstated for a particular reason.  Do the delegates have a view on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500006#E00200","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352975400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I will deal first with the question on fuel laundering as it is easier for me to answer.  <\/p><p>  Certainly, the harmonisation of taxes between North and South would be a good idea, of that there is no doubt.  However, the fundamental fix, as Deputy Michael Conaghan said, is equalising duty rates for green and road diesel because we would eliminate the opportunity in respect of the figure of 53 cent immediately.  Our recommendation indicates that a rebate scheme for farmers should guarantee no cash flow implications and minimise paperwork.  The scheme should be linked with other regular agriculture payment schemes and its operation could be outsourced by way of a competitive tender process to reduce costs.  The problem would be fixed overnight if we were to equalise duty rates for green and road diesel and there would be no need for enforcement, other than in the Border counties.<\/p><p>  On a positive note, there has been some action taken by Revenue and the Garda such that there is now in place a licensing regime for green and road diesel and every service station must have two licences.  This is being enforced by the Revenue Commissioners locally, which is welcome.  There is also the &quot;know your customer&quot; fuel tracing Revenue online product information system that will be introduced in February.  These are positive steps, but they are only stemming the tide of what is significant activity engaged in by illegal gangs.  <\/p><p>  On the use of dye, criminals will just figure out a new way of taking it out.  Every time we have a new dye, this happens within three to six months.  I agree with both Deputies and the Senator that the fix is equalisation.<\/p><p>  In regard to tobacco, we published both figures for the reason that there are conflicting figures.  Revenue states the figure is &euro;250 million, whereas the trade associations, retailers and tobacco manufacturers believe it is closer to &euro;500 million.  Whatever number we use, it is still a massive cost to the Exchequer.  If it is &euro;250 million, that amounts to the extra taxes or cuts we have to raise or make for citizens, which is unacceptable.  Our latest intelligence is based on the many things we do in the industry.  For example, we pulled packets out of litter bins around the country to see what was the percentage of illegal tobacco cartons discarded.  This is a very good barometer of where there is activity and the level varies dramatically.  For example, in Waterford there were high levels of up to 40%, whereas in D&uacute;n Laoghaire it was 10%, with the average figure being approximately 30%.  It is a huge problem and, whether the figure is &euro;250 million or &euro;500 million, we have to tackle it.<\/p><p>  Our recommendation is more resources should be provided.  Such is the scale of the problem, it is our belief that in the short term we probably need to put a competitive tender in place to have some experienced investigators do the investigation work for the Garda and the Customs service and then let the Garda and the Customs service take enforcement action.  The process would pay for itself almost overnight.<\/p><p>  In terms of extra taxes on what is already a heavily taxed product and retail business, we have reached a tipping point.  Anyone who knows anything about the retail business will say tobacco is overtaxed relative to the position in other markets.  Therefore, while there is that attractiveness, it presents a big opportunity for smugglers.  While I do not believe the taxes can be cut because the Government needs the money, our message is that we cannot afford any more.  Clearly, there should be an awareness programme similar to the one in place in the United Kingdom where the <i>www.dodgycigs.co.uk<\/i> website tells people about the implications and dangers of buying tobacco.  It is not good for the individual, but it is also not good in terms of the cost to the individual through extra taxes or cuts.<\/p><p>  That is the high level feedback I wanted to give to the committee.

At any given time, people involved in crime will serve prison sentences.  Members will know from the media that in general any person who is charged with a serious crime will have his previous convictions outlined in the courts.

Some of the major gang members in this country met each other for the first time in prison, although that is not an Irish phenomenon.

People go into shops to buy a packet of cigarettes and smoke them, yet a notice on the packet reads, \"smoking kills\".  One could have a skull and crossbones or a tombstone and skeleton on it and some would still smoke.  People will still buy contraband goods, as they go for a bargain.  It is like the drug trade.  It is an international phenomenon which has not been solved anywhere.  If one was speaking to a police office from Colombia in South America, he or she would say that his or her country would not have a problem if people in western and European countries did not use cocaine.  It is the chicken and egg syndrome, but we must keep at it.  That is the reason we are here to make suggestions.  However, we will not solve the problem overnight.  We can all remember the grim situation of the 1970s and 1980s and what happened in the North because of the activities of the Provisional IRA and various other groups.  It is, of course, disappointing that there are people who are still engaged in this activity, but it is now on a different scale.  The Criminal Assets Bureau was set up in 1996 and it appeared to be the answer to our prayers.  Nevertheless, there is drug dealing; there are criminal gangs and people are being assassinated.

If a person sources a product on the black market as opposed to the legitimate retail chain, it results in the loss of ancillary purchases in that a person who purchases a packet of cigarettes in their local store would also probably also purchase a newspaper or some other small items.  When the legitimate retail chain is taken out of the picture for the main product purchased, be it cigarettes, there is a loss of ancillary product purchases and the State also loses out on revenue from those sales.  Similarly, if a person decides to source cigarettes or counterfeit clothing from a man with a white van who drives around their estate, once that customer is in the bag, so to speak, that criminal can knock on that person's door and sell everything else.  There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that in some areas, perhaps socially deprived parts of our cities, entire shopping lists are being sourced through criminal acts.  We are seeing that through the increase in shoplifting.  Although the main purchase may only be one product, there is the potential for an explosion in those sales once the criminal gang or element has its foot in the door and the State can lose out in a much bigger way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500009#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Lynam"},{"type":"speech","time":1352977200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I have a few questions before we wrap up the discussion.

Do that have a figure for what could be achieved by implementing the recommendations in their report?

This crime is widespread throughout the country and not only prevalent in a city, on Talbot Street or on any street.  The report Mr. Tony Hickey mentioned refers to Meath, Kildare, Waterford city and Limerick.  Every county gets a mention when it comes to these reports.  What is driving this problem?  Is it the current economic situation, was it happening in any event or is organised crime on a roll?  I am trying to get my head around the scale of  the problem in order that we can focus in on trying to solve it<\/p><p>  Mr. Hickey said that there were 23,000 inspections in regard to the sale of tobacco and very few convictions.  This is about targeting resources.  I am not saying we should not target the sale of tobacco but it is about striking a balance.  I read recently there were 2,000 inspections in regard to the sale of eggs and there were more than 700 on compliance in terms of the plastic bag levy.  There has to be a cost to all of these inspections.  Retailers who have appeared before the committee on numerous occasions have said that they are fed up of red tape and being chased up about the sale of eggs.  We need to get real and establish what is the issue.  There must be a cost to the carrying out of these inspections.  Do the representatives have the figure for costs?  If those resources were used in a more balanced way or spread around more areas, perhaps some progress could be made.  Are there inspections of markets where many of these products are sold?  Mr. Tony Hickey said we inspect the licensed premises but it is the trade in the unlicensed premises we are trying to catch.  Are the unlicensed premises inspected?  I would welcome Mr. Tony Hickey's comments on that.<\/p><p>  On the issue of fuel and a fuel rebate, the transport committee has dealt with this issue as have other committees.  A big issue in this context is that farmers are concerned that they could be left waiting for cash.  Mr. Frank Gleeson mentioned earlier that we should have a solution to this issue before we would proceed on this.  Does he have a solution or how can that problem be eased?<\/p><p>  The Road Haulage Association has been working with the cross-departmental group and the finance group to secure a rebate on their fuel costs.  It would claim in its report, and I read through it, that there are massive savings to be made.  It can show that less money would be spent abroad legitimately and that its members would buy their fuel here if there was a rebate facility in place.  It would be a self-financing measure and that it would result in there being more jobs and more taxes would be paid.  Would Mr. Frank Gleeson back up that claim and does he believe it is right?  Has he a view on it from his own position rather than from the position of Retail Ireland?   I would like to hear his thoughts on that.  Those are my questions and I might ask some more later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500009#H01500","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352977200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>That is a comprehensive list of questions and I will attempt to deal with the ones I managed to jot down.  What is driving this is organised criminals seeing an opportunity, as they move out of other activities into one in which they believe there is easy money.  Fuel laundering and the tobacco trade are easy money, the fines are relatively low and the profits are relatively large.  Also, demographics is a factor.  There is no doubt that in a recession people who smoke have less money in their pocket to buy a packet of cigarettes, so the attractiveness of buying a packet of cigarettes for &euro;4 versus &euro;9 is significant.  My problem with that is that this loss is being experienced by the corner shop which relies of those people's footfall to buy a newspaper and a bottle of milk.  It is not the Tescos of this world but the small stores I am worried about - the stores Senator Feargal Quinn has visited as he has tried to help the local towns and villages that are dying.<\/p><p>  On the question of what would happen if we implemented everything in the report, I will pick two categories.  If everything in our recommendation to address fuel laundering was enacted, it could be eliminated completely because there would be no opportunities and that would result in the pretty straightforward recoupment of &euro;150 million.  On the illegal sale of tobacco, if one takes the figure of &euro;500 million, which is I believe is the right number based on my experience as a retailer and from dealing with this issue in recent years, and if the incidence of it was reduced from 30% to 20%, that would result in significant savings of hundreds of millions of euro.  Instead of a &euro;500 million problem, it would become a &euro;20 million problem and we would get back &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million.  That is a big number also.  Some of the other issues such as shoplifting and theft are a little more difficult to address.  They account for a 1.4% loss of margin.  The best levels I have seen are less than 1%, about 0.4 of 1%, which is probably about &euro;50 million maximum. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500009#H01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352977800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Gleeson be able to estimate the number of jobs that would arise from doing this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500010#J00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352977800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>My colleague, Mr. Lynam will respond to that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111500010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Gleeson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352977800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>We did not make an estimate.

There are 1,500 deaths caused by lung cancer in Ireland every year.  It is far and away the leading cause of death from cancer and arguably the leading cause of death.  In the absence of smoking lung cancer would not disappear, but it would become an uncommon disease, as would head and neck and oesophageal cancer.  Pancreatic and bladder cancer would also become less common.  Chronic obstructive airways disease is emerging as the source of a critical health issue and a colossal drain on health resources, as well as being a tragedy for the individuals and families concerned.  The incidence of this disease would decline by 80% to 90% if cigarette smoking disappeared completely.  Premature heart disease, premature strokes, crippling strokes and life-changing strokes would not disappear, but they would become less common.  People smoke because they are addicts.  They may say they smoke because they are exercising some kind of right or a constitutional rightm but the right to smoke is enshrined nowhere.  I am not suggesting we ban smoking, but we do not have a obligation to facilitate it.<\/p><p>  The HSE is moving towards a model which will be activated in 2015.  There will be a ban on smoking anywhere on the campus of any HSE facility - indoors, outdoors, in corridors or carparks.  Every HSE campus will be a smoke-free zone up to the gates and I am proud to say it has already happened.  My institution, St. Vincent's University Hospital, was the first hospital in the country to take this step.  I will provide the committee with a list of the hospitals where a no-smoking ban has been implemented: St. Vincent's University Hospital; St. James's Hospital; Portlaoise General Hospital; James Connolly Memorial Hospital; the Mater Hospital; Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; Louth County Hospital; Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; Cork University Hospital; Waterford Regional Hospital; Galway University Hospital; Croom Orthopaedic Hospital; and the hospitals in Letterkenny, Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh.  If it is good enough for sick patients stuck in hospital beds and hospital staff, it should be good enough for parliamentarians.  It may not be immediately obvious with all the best press politicians have had in recent years, but we still remain some form of role models.  My fantasy is that this could become the first smoke-free parliament campus.  If we do this, we should also launch a major smoking cessation help programme for parliamentarians and members of the staff in Leinster House.  It would be a wonderful flagship initiative if we could say the country that first banned smoking in the workplace also had the first smoke-free parliament campus and the addicts had all been cured.  <\/p><p>  The third and most important reason is we need to consider the health of the individuals who smoke.  I do not smoke and cannot make a case that my health has been compromised by someone smoking in the middle of the carpark in Leinster House, although I find it extremely distasteful.  I recently read about an individual who was a frequent visitor to Leinster House.  In the course of an interview this person talked about their young children.  I have never seen this person without a cigarette.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500003#C00600","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352972100,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I am speaking as a person who suffers from nicotine addiction and whom on occasions Professor Crown has lectured in his forthright way as to what one would say to one's children or somebody else.

I am 100% behind that but I believe there is a better way to achieve it than by the imposition of a ban.<\/p><p>  If the motion is pressed, I will of course wish the exercise success and will play my part in encouraging compliance.

In 2002, when I first came to Leinster House, we could smoke in the office.  At the time I smoked.  It is ridiculous to recall the cloud of fog in which we used to work in the office and in the ante-rooms off the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  At the time the smoking ban was introduced, I opposed it through the back channels.  How wrong I was.  There is no question but that I would not have succeeded in giving up cigarettes if it were not for the ban.  However, Leinster House is a place of work and some of those who work here smoke.  As other speakers have said, it is not against the law as yet.  As you pointed out, Chairman, it is a matter for the Joint Administration Committee and probably ultimately the Oireachtas Commission to decide whether a smoking ban is introduced.  Based on what I have heard from fellow committee members, the best we can do today is to express the aspiration that a ban may be achievable, but in consultation with staff.  It is important that a good message be sent.  Such a view could go to the Joint Administration Committee and it could make arrangements.<\/p><p>  I do not disagree with anything Senator Crown has said.  He is absolutely correct.  We all wish to work towards his goal, but there are a number of different ways to achieve it.  The Aviva stadium is a smoke-free zone, yet at concerts and matches there is a single smoking area.  Perhaps that is step one.  I am not so sure about hiding the smoking area.  I agree with Deputy Dowds: it brings me back to my school days when we were smoking in toilets.  I support the other proposal made by Senator Crown that the committee should sponsor a campaign to assist all staff who currently smoke to give up cigarettes, although it should not ban them from smoking, and perhaps express the strong aspiration today that we will ultimately achieve smoke-free status for this Parliament in consultation with the permanent staff.

Somebody needs to tell the Health Service Executive, HSE, that because that is what it has done in 17 hospitals and what it will do in every hospital in the country within the next two years.  Already that is the case in the HSE headquarters and in many public buildings and campuses.  It is policy.

In the 1980s my mother owned a restaurant called Whites on the Green. Some Members are old enough to remember it.  I was the little boy hiding under the coat rack.  Many years later I published <i>The Dubliner 100 Best Restaurants<\/i>, which was the best-selling restaurant guide in this country.  More recently I have written about the politics of food production.<\/p><p>  I am not here in a professional capacity but as the father of two small boys.  I am worried about bringing my boys up in a country with one of the world's highest rates of childhood obesity, a country in which an entire generation of children are in danger of dying younger than their parents.  My views of childhood obesity will strike some Members as extreme.  I believe that one day the cost of treating the diseases resulting from obesity will become so great that people will wonder why we did not act sooner.  The idea that dangerous food was once advertised directly to children will strike us all as properly embarrassing.<\/p><p>  Childhood obesity is not yet a major political issue in Ireland, which is the reason that industry still controls the terms of the debate and why my views are still regarded as eccentric.  In that regard I have read the submissions to the joint committee with great interest.  Time and again, members have been told how complex the issue of childhood obesity is and have heard many claims about product reformulation, the importance of the stakeholder approach, partnerships with industry, but most of all they have heard how consumers much change their behaviour.  By 2030 more than half of Irish adults will be obese, yet right now the food industry is engaged in a very expensive campaign to blame the public for the problem.  I find it truly remarkable that obesity is still framed as an issue of personal responsibility.  This line seems plausible only because it is so familiar.  We tolerated the same argument from big tobacco companies for decades and it is demonstrably rubbish.  After all, the incidence of obesity increases year after year.  Were Irish people any less responsible in 2011 than they were in 2010?  Of course not. Blaming the victim is just an excuse to let industry off the hook.  <\/p><p>  Let us speak frankly about this public health crisis.  Unlike many of the people who have come before the committee, I believe it is not nearly as complex as they suggest.  Broadly speaking there are three options.  Option one is to take the advice of industry and tighten those belts and build more gyms, jog and cycle to work, play camogie.  These are all laudable goals in their way.  There is room for the personal responsibility argument, as old and lazy as it is.  After all, no one seriously proposes that people should exercise less - stretching those legs is an obvious good, as is full employment, peace in our time, the pot at the end of the rainbow.  As a strategy for survival, it is simply ineffective.  Yet this is all one ever hears, the same weary mantras, and when any form of Government intervention is mentioned, industry throws its arms to heaven and says that it will not work and it will cost jobs.  Let us unpack that.  If it will not work, why will it cost any jobs?  The fact that we are only tinkering around the edge with talk of self-regulation and something as disingenuous as an advertising watershed speaks to the success of industry and our failure as a society.<\/p><p>  If one wants a tangible example of the insincerity of what I am referring to, just consider the name of an industry lobby group that made a presentation this morning, The Nutrition and Health Foundation.  This fake movement -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500010#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Trevor White"},{"type":"speech","time":1352975100,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I advise Mr. White that he is speaking under privilege and words such as \"fake movement\" are not necessarily correct.

It sounds so cuddly, warm and uncontroversial until one begins to look a little deeper.  The Nutrition and Health Foundation claims to put the interests of consumers before everything else, yet it cares so much about Irish consumers that it will not let them join.  I know this because I tried to join the Nutrition and Health Foundation.  After seven months of equivocation, my application was flatly rejected.<\/p><p>  Option two is to ask industry to be nicer, to reveal the damage they are doing to children, beg them to go easy on the fats, salt and sugar.  Sadly this policy has proved futile for nearly 30 years and in that time the incidence of childhood obesity has shot up alongside high blood pressure, heart disease, type two diabetes, stroke and certain forms of cancer.  Why?  Quite simply because corporations put short-term profit before all other concerns. <\/p><p>  The third option is that the legislators can intervene, that is the Members can convince the Minister for Health to introduce the legislation that will tackle this problem and thus secure a place in history.  This is not just an Irish issue, this is a problem throughout the developed world.  There is a profound need for leadership on obesity and the actions of members could have wide reaching consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500010#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Trevor White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352975700,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. White for his thought-provoking and analytical presentation.

I have been in the leisure industry for 19 years, with most of those years spent working in large-scale facilities in the public leisure sector.  Mr. Walsh has more than 20 years' experience in the private leisure sector in the UK and Ireland, based predominantly in Dublin.<\/p><p>  ILAM is a not-for-profit organisation and a national employers' body for the leisure, fitness and recreational industry across 26 counties.  We represent leisure centres in the public and private sectors, outdoor pursuit centres, community centres and providers of education to the industry.  There are approximately 700 leisure centres across 26 counties of Ireland.  This illustrates the scale of the number of facilities.  We do not need more gyms or pools; we have plenty of people to help with the implementation of the strategy.  As Dr. Cullen suggested, we must take a multidisciplinary approach instead of having silo mentalities, as has been the case where resources and personnel are duplicated and replicated.  Our industry employs a broad spectrum of professional staff, including fitness professionals, cardiac rehabilitation and GP referral professionals, physiotherapists and swim instructors.<\/p><p>  ILAM is a voluntary board whose main aim is to provide self-regulation for the industry and promote competencies throughout communities.  We are very much embedded in our communities across 26 counties.  We self-regulate through a white flag quality standard.  We work with the HSE on child protection guidelines.  We met with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to discuss the protection of children using our facilities.  We have relationships with the Garda vetting bureau.  All of our professional fitness staff are Garda-vetted.  We operate a register of exercise professionals in order to validate their qualifications.  Our leisure centres are accessible to all.  We co-operate with partners in the UK, in Europe and internationally.  These partner associations undertake research, lobby on behalf of the industry in order to improve participation and deal with societal health issues.  Childhood obesity is not just an Irish issue; rather, it is a global issue.<\/p><p>  The purpose of our presentation is to explain the opportunity that exists for our leisure industry to implement obesity strategies by means of our facilities and personnel.  We have made assumptions that the diagnostic and intervention processes have been completed.  We are here to show how these strategies can be implemented effectively.  <\/p><p>  Our industry is based on participation.  Our facilities across the country are embedded in their communities.  We need multi-level partnerships, collaboration and a common vision.  I concur with Dr. Cullen's vision in this regard.  We need commitment from all of the agencies, institutions and organisations to make this change and to increase participation, as mentioned on page 133 of the report of the Irish Sports Council.  However, nothing is happening with regard to engaging these people and organisations.  The reports are available.  We are here today to say that we are able to help, and we ask the committee to let us help.  We have the referral pathways, the competencies and the resources to provide pathways for obese and pre-obese clients before medical intervention is required.  Anyone who watched the RTE television programme \"The Obesity Clinic\" last Monday night must have found it distressing.  The people in the programme have to seek medical intervention because they have reached that stage.  They may not have had the opportunity to get help from exercise professionals to improve their quality of life.  Our industry is part of this multidisciplinary approach to increased participation.  We provide a primary care solution.  <\/p><p>  The UK model known as MEND tackles obesity in the community, dealing in particular with children aged seven to 13 years.  It is a multidisciplinary approach.  Interventions include behavioural change by means of land-based and water-based activities, advice on nutrition and educational advice.  Implementation is carried out in after-school settings, community groups, leisure centres and schools.  This model has resulted in increased participation, reduced BMI and increasing self-esteem and confidence among the children involved.<\/p><p>  I can cite a case from Leisure World.  We were looking for a project to prove to our industry that leisure professionals can provide a sustainable and successful approach to citizens whose health issues need to be tackled.  We were looking for participants who had never entered a leisure facility, whose BMI was over a certain figure and who were intimidated at the prospect of using our facilities.  This was an adult-based project.  We wanted to promote the fact that the leisure industry is a key provider of pathways and can offer direct access to members of the public who would benefit from professional exercise advice and support.  The 12-week programme known as Project Weight Loss was born.  We advertised in the hope of attracting 30 participants with BMIs over 25 who were inactive.  The initial project was oversubscribed, with 120 applicants.  Sixty participants were initially accommodated on the pilot scheme, which was supported through the Cork sports partnership.  I have provided a slide showing the results achieved by the 60 participants.  Every participant lost weight and size, by which I mean centimetres off their body measurements.  Over the past three months, there have been 300 participants in the programme.  Between 15% and 20% of participants did not complete the programme due to ill-health, life issues or a lack of confidence, but 40% of the 300 are currently independently exercising in a gym or doing some other activity because they have the confidence required to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Christine Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352976300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Moloney for attending and for an excellent presentation.

They may be diverse but we will always have diverse opinions in a democracy.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a number of points.  I share the concern of the speakers about the figures quoted on obesity and the prediction that by 2030 half our adult population will be obese.  Apart from the health and welfare of people the drain that will put on the Exchequer in the future is a serious concern, although it is secondary to our concern for people's welfare.<\/p><p>  Mention was made of awareness in schools but highlighting the issue must begin at home.  Given that a recent report by the Irish League of Credit Unions stated that families have only &euro;100 disposal income at the end of the month, inexpensive, unhealthy food versus expensive healthy food is a major issue.  Some families would love to give their children the healthiest food available but they cannot afford to do that.  The primary aim is to feed their family.<\/p><p>  From speaking to my constituents I am aware that the national playground policy of 2002 is quite successful in terms of playgrounds being installed in large urban areas and larger villages throughout the constituency.  That was a major benefit in terms of encouraging children to exercise on a more frequent basis.<\/p><p>  Mr. White rightly stated that dealing with this problem cannot all be down to personal responsibility but I am a firm believer in personal responsibility and taking responsibilities for our own decisions.  Whether it be from a health or financial perspective one cannot abdicate one's responsibility in totality.  One must take responsibility for oneself and one's own actions.

They are all very welcome.  I do not have many questions to ask.<\/p><p>  There is no question but that Mr. Trevor White's contribution has challenged us.  That merits some further consideration and, no pun intended, we need to chew on it.  It is not a bad thing to be challenged.  I welcome that.  The representatives should not think, in terms of any of their cases, that by not asking questions we are not interested.  We are deeply interested in all they have outlined.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Nutritional Health Foundation's representative, Dr. Cullen.  I will not address the issues Mr. White raised regarding the composition of the foundation or the way one accesses it.  However, I note that in the circulated pre-meeting text there is a significant food and beverage industry representation.  There is a 2:3 ratio from the point of view of the food and beverage industry to non-industry partners.  I have a minor concern about the presentation, although I am encouraged by several of the points in it.<\/p> <p>Reference was made to prioritisation.  It is all to do with perception.  The NHF chooses two groups to prioritise in the context of childhood obesity - pregnant women and children.  It helps to make the point that was made in the contrary presentation by Mr. White because it is important that the food and beverage industry have priority consideration in the matters under address.  It does place the priority responsibility on the individual.  We are all challenged by an array of different pressures in modern life choices.  Time is a big factor and affordability is another issue.  This does not apply only to the choices we make about the foodstuffs we purchase in supermarkets or convenience stores.<\/p><p> It is not an issue for me whether research and development incentives for the industry are the carrot or the stick but incentives must be put in place for the industry to make better choices in the component parts of their products.  Are there alternatives to the ingredients used in the manufacture of products aimed at the food shelves of our supermarkets?  Can we examine the notion of encouraging research and development into alternative ingredients that are less threatening to our general health, with a particular focus on obesity in young people?<\/p><p> Deputy Dowds referred to the sugar tax proposal.  It is important that everything is measured.  It is not that sugar is bad for people.  Sugar creates energy and is an essential ingredient in many products.  The issue is the excessive employment of sugar in many products that are currently available, and there needs to be an identification of what is normal, reasonable or acceptable and where the excess needs to be confronted.  That is where we should focus some attention.<\/p><p> I know from my role as a D&aacute;il Deputy over the past number of years - I am not attacking the leisure industry - that a fact of life in these ever-straitened economic times is that more and more families cannot afford access to leisure facilities and activities because of prohibitive costs.  Families in my constituency have made a conscious effort to encourage their young children's participation in a variety of physical activities, and I acknowledge there are cheap or no-cost alternatives, but it is difficult in these times when some children can enjoy access to certain activities and others cannot.  This contributes to the sense of inequality in our society.  As Dr. Cullen pointed out, it leads to a similar choice to that between a healthy but costly food option and an unhealthy but less expensive option.  The expense issue features not only in our food choices but in all other choices life offers and, for many, these cannot be offered because they cannot afford them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500012#M00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352976900,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I thank all those who made presentations.  We have debated this issue over the past few months.  When I was growing up, I did not know anybody on my road who was obese.  Everybody skipped and played beds, rounders and football.  On Hallowe'en, I saw the largest number of children on my street over the past number of weeks as they knocked on doors with their baskets.  It would have been an interesting exercise to have pricked the finger of every child in school the following day to see how much their sugar levels had increased.  Two 14-year-old lads knocked on my door and said they only wanted money or sweets and that anything else would not be acceptable.  I love a bar of chocolate.  I bought a tape in the chemist that one puts around one's waist and found that I am obese.  I was not obese in my late teens or early 20s but when I started to have children, for some strange reason, I became obese.  Lifestyle is an issue and I agree with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Troy that the amount people have in their pockets is also an issue.<\/p><p>  We had a group before the committee a few weeks ago talking about healthy food, and I was struck by a number of remarks they made.  They said more children in poorer areas are obese because they eat cheaper cuts of meat and eat fish fingers rather than fish.  If I go into my local supermarket to buy fish, I am always struck by the fact that one piece of fish costs more than the hourly minimum wage.  As we are an island nation, we must do something to rectify this.  Parents - I include myself in this - fill supermarket baskets, not children, and there is a significant responsibility on them.  It is no harm to put in a bar of chocolate now and again but we need to realise that what people are putting in does not reflect what children should eat.  I believe a little of everything is good for people.  I do not drink or smoke and nothing is harmful if it is consumed in moderation.  I have never met a child who plays camogie where I live.  The kids I know play football in the local GAA club on Saturdays and they kick around a ball at the local youth club.  I think, therefore, that Mr. White and I are talking about a different range of people.<\/p><p>  If I had a wish come true tomorrow and the State had loads of money, I would provide funding for schools to make sure every child has a one-hour physical education lesson every day with a professionally trained PE teacher and not with the girl who is trying to teach them English, Irish and mathematics.  If we are serious about tackling childhood obesity, we need to start putting primary school children into gymnasiums where professionals can put them through rigorous exercises.  I do not mean boot camps, but that is where we should begin.  Many children where I live are delighted when their parents take them for a walk along the canal or to the local park, but most parents sit in front of the television or an iPad or something else that prevents them from taking time out of their busy days to sit with their children for ten minutes.  Like most parents, I work, and I feel that over the past 13 years that I have been in politics, I have missed out on a great deal of the lives of my two youngest girls.<\/p><p>  I thank the representatives for their interesting presentations, but the number one priority is to put children into gymnasiums in school.  I know many families who cannot afford to go swimming in the local pool in Ballyfermot because they do not have the money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500013#N00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1352976900,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500013#N00300","speaker":"1011","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352977500,"counter":287,"content":"<p>On the cost of food, it needs to be brought back to basics.  From a nutrition point of view, fresher food produce can be more expensive.  As there are certainly many specials available in supermarkets, it is a question of looking out for them.  Tinned and frozen foods can be as, or even more, nutritious than unprocessed food because they have not been left lying degenerating on the supermarket shelf.<\/p><p>  As I said, we have cases in which we have had intervention in the GP setting to show mothers how uncomplicated it is to have a healthier diet, as well as encouraging more physical activity which will also benefit the future health of their children.  However, I agree we need to have greater intervention at school level, with healthy eating guidelines and physical activity, which need to become compulsory.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne on the need for physical education every day for one hour, particularly considering our children need 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day.  As we know we are not reaching that target, school is an important environment in which to exert influence in this regard.<\/p><p>  The home environment is also key when it comes to food consumption choices, how often they are consumed and cooked, etc.  We need to bring into home economics in school aspects such as the enjoyment of food and balanced diets.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to be prescriptive with children when it comes to the food pyramid because they grow at different rates.  However, there are suggested portion sizes for the different age groups.  A colleague of mine has told me that when her kids tell her they are hungry, she tells them to have a piece of fruit.  If they say no to the fruit, she knows they are not really hungry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500014#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Muireann Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1352977500,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Does that indicate the difficulty we encounter that we see fruit as being the non-sexy choice when it should be the first choice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012111500014#O00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352977500,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Healthy eating should be as natural as anything physical.

Sporty girls are seen as more masculine.  We need to dispel this and create a positive movement around physical activity.
