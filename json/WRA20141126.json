Since that time, David Ford MLA has been Minister for Justice with responsibility for prison policy.  An executive agency of his Department, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, is responsible for implementing prison policy.<\/p><p>  A comprehensive Review of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, chaired by Anne Owers and which flowed from the Hillsborough Agreement, was published in October 2011.  This Review set out a path to reform the prison system in the North.  Implementation of the forty recommendations made by Anne Owers and her Prison Review Team is due to be completed next year, and progress is overseen by an independent expert group which reports every six months.<\/p><p>  Owers recognised that Maghaberry was unable to meet the challenge of seeking to provide appropriate security, and sufficient and relevant activity, for its long and short term prisoners, including those imprisoned for paramilitary offences.<\/p><p>  In summer 2010, Republican prisoners in Maghberry's Roe House wing protested at conditions: an agreement between prisoners and prison management, known as the Roe House Agreement, was concluded in August 2010 and four independent assessors were appointed to assist in its oversight and delivery.<\/p><p>  On the recommendation of the Prisoner Ombudsman, Tom McGonigle, the independent assessors carried out a stocktake of implementation of the Roe House Agreement in August and September this year.  Their stocktake report was published by Minister Ford on 12 November and highlights areas of progress since 2010 and issues of concern to prisoners and management.  The report was based on free access to Maghaberry and to its prisoners, as well as extensive contact with the prison authorities, the Prisoner Ombudsman, and with Prison Officer representatives.  I understand that any documentation requested was made available.<\/p><p>  The independent assessors highlight the murder of a prison officer, David Black, in November 2012 by so called dissident Republicans as a significant challenge and a breach of the principles underpinning the Agreement: ongoing and recent threats against members of the Northern Ireland Prison Service and officials dealing with prisoner welfare have further complicated relations and damaged trust between the Prison Service and prisoners.<\/p><p>  All threats against those working in prisons and with prisoners in Northern Ireland are completely unacceptable and should be lifted immediately.<\/p><p>  The recent stocktake report was accepted by the Northern Ireland Prison Service and by the relevant prisoners, and opens an opportunity to resolve outstanding matters so that the unimplemented elements of the Roe House Agreement can be achieved.  The independent assessors recommend a timeline of six months for the resolution of outstanding issues.  I would encourage all concerned to make the most of this opportunity.<\/p><p>  I have discussed these issues with Minister Ford and will continue to do so as appropriate.

Since that time, David Ford MLA has been Minister for Justice with responsibility for prison policy.  An executive agency of his Department, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, is responsible for implementing prison policy.<\/p><p>  A comprehensive Review of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, chaired by Anne Owers and which flowed from the Hillsborough Agreement, was published in October 2011.  This Review set out a path to reform the prison system in the North.  Implementation of the forty recommendations made by Anne Owers and her Prison Review Team is due to be completed next year, and progress is overseen by an independent expert group which reports every six months.  <\/p><p>  Owers recognised that Maghaberry was unable to meet the challenge of seeking to provide appropriate security, and sufficient and relevant activity, for its long and short term prisoners, including those imprisoned for paramilitary offences.<\/p><p>  In summer 2010, Republican prisoners in Maghberry's Roe House wing protested at conditions: an agreement between prisoners and prison management, known as the Roe House Agreement, was concluded in August 2010 and four independent assessors were appointed to assist in its oversight and delivery.<\/p><p>  On the recommendation of the Prisoner Ombudsman, Tom McGonigle, the independent assessors carried out a stocktake of implementation of the Roe House Agreement in August and September this year.  Their stocktake report was published by Minister Ford on 12 November and highlights areas of progress since 2010 and issues of concern to prisoners and management.  The report was based on free access to Maghaberry and to its prisoners, as well as extensive contact with the prison authorities, the Prisoner Ombudsman, and with Prison Officer representatives.<\/p><p>  I understand that any documentation requested was made available.<\/p><p>  The independent assessors highlight the murder of a prison officer, David Black, in November 2012 by so called dissident Republicans as a significant challenge and a breach of the principles underpinning the Agreement: ongoing and recent threats against members of the Northern Ireland Prison Service and officials dealing with prisoner welfare have further complicated relations and damaged trust between the Prison Service and prisoners.  All threats against those working in prisons and with prisoners in Northern Ireland are completely unacceptable and should be lifted immediately.<\/p><p>  The recent stocktake report was accepted by the Northern Ireland Prison Service and by the relevant prisoners, and opens an opportunity to resolve outstanding matters so that the unimplemented elements of the Roe House Agreement can be achieved.  The independent assessors recommend a timeline of six months for the resolution of outstanding issues.  I would encourage all concerned to make the most of this opportunity.<\/p><p>  I have discussed these issues with Minister Ford and will continue to do so as appropriate. I also intend to meet the independent assessors who concluded the stocktake report over the coming weeks.

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  During my visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings on this important issue with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts, including Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Secretary of State John Kerry.<br\/><br\/>As you are all aware, last Thursday President Obama announced new measures which should benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US.  Pending further possible measures being considered by the US Congress, the President's measures are a step forward which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on immigrants' lives.  The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers (CIIC) have welcomed President Obama's announcement as an important first step in allowing for much needed improvements to the immigration system.  At the core of his proposals is that undocumented immigrants in the US for more than 5 years, who have children who are US citizens or legal residents, who register, go through background checks and pay their taxes, will be protected from deportation and given temporary legal status.  I particularly welcome a provision which, for the first time, albeit under limited conditions, will permit some travel from and to the United States for those undocumented Irish who are eligible to apply under the arrangements President Obama has announced.  <b>Details as to how the travel provision will work in practice have yet to be confirmed but through our Embassy in Washington, we are following up on it directly with the White House and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.<\/b><br\/><br\/>This clearly represents real progress, albeit with further important steps yet to be achieved, and I am happy that the relentless efforts of the Government and our Embassy and diplomatic missions in close partnership with the Irish community in the US have begun to bear fruit.  I am determined that as many Irish nationals as possible will benefit from these changes and, to that end, our missions in the US will continue to work in partnership with the excellent Irish immigration centres there whose work my Department supports.  At the same time, I am by no means complacent about what has yet to be done.<br\/><br\/>I am well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and that our work to encourage further changes in this area must be pushed forward proactively.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that on immigration reform, as President Obama himself has indicated, there is no substitute for legislative action by Congress.  The government and our Embassy will continue to work with the US Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders.  We already have strong friendships across both aisles in Congress and will keep building our network of friends on Capitol Hill.  Through our Embassy and Consulates in the U.S. and through direct political contacts with the Administration and all sides in Congress, we will continue to encourage further steps that will reflect the concerns and needs of the undocumented Irish and their families, as well as ensuring improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600068#WRA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600069#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[45059\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600069#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the role he plays in ensuring that climate justice features in the upcoming legislation on climate change in view of the fact that it will take into account the disproportionate effects which some developing countries have experienced as a result of climate change and aside from the legislation; if any other diplomatic efforts are being made to raise and tackle this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>Climate change is already having an enormous effect on the lives and the livelihoods of some of the poorest people in the world.

We called for an immediate halt to the continuous violations of the ceasefire, a withdrawal of all foreign forces and military equipment from Ukraine, as well as a securing of the border between Ukraine and Russia with permanent monitoring by the OSCE.<\/p><p>  It is clear that a lasting ceasefire remains central to the success of current efforts to reach a sustainable political solution, based on respect for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.<\/p><p>  In light of the deteriorating security situation in eastern Ukraine and the holding of so-called &ldquo;parliamentary and presidential elections&rdquo; in Luhansk and Dontesk on 2 November which the EU considers illegal, the Council decided to ask the European External Action Service and the European Commission to present a proposal for additional listings under Phase II sanctions, targeting separatists. A decision will be taken on this proposal at the end of the month. <\/p><p>  Together with my EU partners, I also underlined the clear need for intensified talks in the framework of the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group. In this regard, I would like to highlight the vital contribution that the OSCE has made to date in helping to broker the ceasefire agreement and to monitor its implementation in a challenging and sometimes hostile environment. Our continued support for their important work is needed.<\/p><p>  In welcoming the parliamentary elections that took place in Ukraine on 26 October, Ministers looked forward to the urgent formation of a new Government. I believe that it is important that Ukraine seize the mandate for reform given by the Ukrainian people and take the opportunity for outreach, national dialogue and reconciliation. I am convinced that sustainable and real progress in the reform programme must be an integral part of the strategy to overcome the current crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600069#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[44962\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the European Union directly or in conjunction with the UN continues to make a persistent and positive impact in the context of the Middle East, the Ukraine-Russian situation and other sensitive flashpoints around the globe; if he is satisfied regarding the success of efforts to date in this regard; if reassessment of these situations is warranted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>As a global actor, the EU is continuously engaged, both directly and in conjunction with the UN and other international partners, in making a positive contribution to help prevent and overcome conflicts around the world. Peace building and conflict prevention are central to the EU&rsquo;s actions on the international stage, and particularly in the context of the pressing conflicts with which we are currently faced. Indeed, the EU has established peace missions and operations in many of the most sensitive regions, including most recently in Ukraine. These peace missions work actively to contribute to stability and improved security across the globe.<\/p><p>  Since the outset of the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has sought to play an active role in helping to find a peaceful solution. We have strongly supported the OSCE, including through financial assistance and seconded staff, in their crucial role in both negotiation a ceasefire and monitoring its implementation.  The EU has also directly pursued the path of diplomatic dialogue to achieve an outcome fully respecting Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  At the UN level, we supported and worked to promote the adoption of the resolution on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.<\/p><p>  In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russian actions to destabilise eastern Ukraine, the EU introduced sanctions which have been gradually stepped up as the situation on the ground has developed. These sanctions are an effective means by which to encourage all sides to come to the negotiating table.  We firmly believe that the measures taken in relation to Russia, coupled with continued political and diplomatic engagement with the various sides involved in the conflict, is the best way to create the conditions for this engagement.<\/p><p>  Internal reform aimed at building the broadest possible consensus across the country in Ukraine must also be central to any strategy to overcome the crisis.  The EU has established an Advisory Mission on Rule of Law under its Common Security and Defence policy to support the Ukrainian authorities in their efforts to reform the civilian security sector.  My Department is funding the participation of two Irish members of this Mission. <\/p><p>  The EU has also played a positive role in supporting the international response to the humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the conflict in eastern Ukraine. To date, the European Commission has mobilised &euro;10.8 million in humanitarian assistance and &euro; 17 million in development funding. &euro;4.5 million has been provided specifically to meet the recovery and integration needs of the large number of civilians who have had to flee their homes and towns.<\/p><p>  Considerable ongoing efforts are being made by the international community, in which Ireland is actively engaged, to resolve, and where possible prevent, conflicts, human rights abuses, and atrocity crimes across the Middle East. The international community, including the EU and UN, are using all the available instruments to foster constructive dialogue and to encourage peaceful, negotiated solutions to political differences in the region.<\/p><p>  As I made clear in my address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, there can be no complacency within the international community about the threat which ISIS and other extremists represent or about the need for urgent international action to confront this threat to us all. In this speech, I also underlined that it is long past time for the attainment of a comprehensive peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples by means of the realization of a just, negotiated two-State solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[44971\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress made to date on resolving the issue of the undocumented Irish in the US; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>This is a repeat of my previous answer to Question No. 2.<\/p><p>  This is, and will remain, a priority for the Government in our bilateral relationship with the United States. Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. During my visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings on this important issue with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts, including Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Secretary of State John Kerry.<\/p><p>  As you are all aware, last Thursday President Obama announced new measures which should benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US. Pending further possible measures being considered by the US Congress, the President&rsquo;s measures are a step forward which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on immigrants&rsquo; lives. The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers (CIIC) have welcomed President Obama's announcement as an important first step in allowing for much needed improvements to the immigration system. At the core of his proposals is that undocumented immigrants in the US for more than 5 years, who have children who are US citizens or legal residents, who register, go through background checks and pay their taxes, will be protected from deportation and given temporary legal status.  I particularly welcome a provision which, for the first time, albeit under limited conditions, will permit some travel from and to the United States for those undocumented Irish who are eligible to apply under the arrangements President Obama has announced.  Details as to how the travel provision will work in practice have yet to be confirmed but through our Embassy in Washington, we are following up on it directly with the White House and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.<\/p><p>  This clearly represents real progress, albeit with further important steps yet to be achieved, and I&rsquo;m happy that the relentless efforts of the Government and our Embassy and diplomatic missions in close partnership with the Irish community in the US have begun to bear fruit. I am determined that as many Irish nationals as possible will benefit from these changes and, to that end, our missions in the US will continue to work in partnership with the excellent Irish immigration centres there whose work my Department supports. At the same time, I am by no means complacent about what has yet to be done. I&rsquo;m well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and that our work to encourage further changes in this area must be pushed forward proactively.<\/p><p>  It is clear that on immigration reform, as President Obama himself has indicated, there is no substitute for legislative action by Congress. The government and our Embassy will continue to work with the US Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders.  We already have strong friendships across both aisles in Congress and will keep building our network of friends on Capitol Hill. Through our Embassy and Consulates in the U.S. and through direct political contacts with the Administration and all sides in Congress, we will continue to encourage further steps that will reflect the concerns and needs of the undocumented Irish and their families, as well as ensuring improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[44995\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600070#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the on-going hostilities in Ukraine; if a full assessment has been made as to the impact of Russian sanctions on Ireland; if he will provide an update on actions taken by the EU to ease the crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>I continue to closely monitor developments in Ukraine and am deeply concerned by the significant deterioration in the security situation in the east of the country.

The ban has had negative repercussions on our agri-food sector, with exports of diary and seafood most affected. The impact on Ireland of the Russian restrictions is being closely monitored by the Department of Agriculture and Food but it is clearly a setback to our plans for the Russian market.<\/p><p>  Minister Coveney is fully aware of the need to seek out alternative markets for Irish agri-food exports and has already had success in this regard with the opening of the Philippines to Irish beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat and Vietnam to Irish pigmeat.

It is currently hosting some 450,000 refugees in Dadaab in the north-  eastern region of the country, many of whom have fled conflict and recurring drought in Somalia.

The State Laboratory makes use of an array of tests to determine whether a relevant adulteration of the petrol has occurred. \u00a0Revenue is also working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a joint investigation of a concentration of complaints in the midlands and west.<\/p><p>  All licensed filling stations in the midlands have been subject to compliance checks by Revenue staff over the past twelve months. Complaints alleging petrol stretching have been received in relation to eleven named filling stations in counties Westmeath, Roscommon and Longford and these are being investigated.<\/p><p>  A\u00a0total of 129 samples of petrol from filling stations in the Border Midlands West Region have been referred for analysis to the State Laboratory following checks conducted from June 2014 to date.\u00a0 Conclusive results have been received from the State Laboratory in two samples which indicate the contamination of petrol through the presence of kerosene. Files are being prepared for prosecution arising from these results.\u00a0 To date, no evidence of fraudulently contaminated petrol has been found in any of the other samples referred for analysis and this includes the samples taken in the midlands.<\/p><p>  As part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered by Enforcement officers throughout the Border Midlands West Region. No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date.<\/p><p>  The\u00a0Revenue Commissioners are continuing their investigation in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are actively sampling suspect filling stations, monitoring deliveries of petrol and examining the supply chain in an effort to determine the origin of the suspect petrol. Petrol stretching is an offence under Section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999. The Deputy can be assured that, if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples by the State Laboratory indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<\/p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol and should report any suspicions to Revenue.\u00a0 Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically dealing with the shadow economy and this includes a reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices, including the adulteration of fuel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600073#WRF00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600073#WRF00650"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[45419\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600073#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason equipment needed for citizens, and specifically children, with special needs is charged at the higher VAT rate; his plans to reduce the rate of VAT on special needs equipment in view of the fact that it places an extra financial burden on support groups, particularly voluntary groups; if there is any means by which voluntary organisations that work with children with special needs may claim a refund on VAT paid on specialist equipment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The ISIF Business Plan will be approved in due course by the new NTMA Board in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Economic Impact Framework will seek to identify target areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impact, and will also facilitate the identification of categories of investment that would be expected to assist and accelerate normalisation of capital markets in Ireland post the financial crisis. <br\/><br\/>Because of uncertainty regarding investment opportunities that emerge or can be developed, the nature and shape of the ISIF's ultimate investment portfolio and the quantum of co-investment that can be achieved is not clear at this stage.  There will also be a time lag between the NPRF\/ISIF commitment and when the economic impact takes place.  Therefore it is not feasible at this stage to estimate in advance what the economic activity and employment impacts of the ISIF may be.  The ISIF Business Plan and the new NTMA Board are expected to address this issue. <br\/><br\/>In the interim, the NTMA is developing its capabilities for collating and analysing data to measure and report on economic impact on an ex-post basis (i.e. after the investment has been made).  This will require a completely new data set to be sought and reported on by funds and the underlying companies in which funds have invested and by companies or project sponsors in which the NPRF has invested directly.  While it is standard practice that companies report financial information to their investors, the new ISIF mandate will also require metrics that can be used to help assess economic impact to be reported.  The NTMA expects to be able to publish a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland after the Business Plan has been approved by the new NTMA Board.<br\/><br\/>The most recently reported balance for cash and cash equivalents in the NPRF Discretionary Portfolio was &euro;2,470 million as at 30 September 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600076#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Rate","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600076#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[45552\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600076#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person in mortgage arrears who has the arrears capitalised as part of an arrangement with their bank will no longer appear on the Central Bank of Ireland and his Department's statistics as being in arrears; his views that this gives a potentially misleading picture of the true nature of mortgage difficulties in the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.

This process of revaluation is provided for under section 19 of the Act.If there are changes in rents between revaluation dates then this may be reflective of a general downward movement in rents.  If all rents that were reduced resulted in changes on the valuation list then this would not necessarily result in a reduction in rates.  This is because the amount of rates collected is a function of the Annual Rate on Valuation set by the Local Authority multiplied by the valuation of a property on the valuation list.  Valuations could go down but the ARV would increase and there may be no change to the rates amount due.  The revaluation of all properties in a rating authority area takes place no sooner than 5 years and no later than 10 years after the first revaluation has taken place.  For example the next revaluation of South Dublin will be completed before the end of 2017.  This is also the standard model in other jurisdictions with an annual property charge similar to rates and is provided for in section 25 of the Act.As regards the<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">\u00a0assumption\u00a0 about delays underlying the\u00a0concerns raised with the Deputy,<\/font>I\u00a0have no reason to believe\u00a0 at this stage that the revaluations will not be completed on time.<br\/><br\/>A separate process called revision of valuation provides for the value of an individual property to be amended or revised where a &quot;material change of circumstances&quot; has occurred in relation to the property.  Such a revision may only take account of purely structural alterations to a property or the subdivision of a property into two or more separate properties or the amalgamation of a property with one or more other rateable properties.  A review of valuation of an individual property arising from a change in economic circumstances would not be in keeping with the principles of valuation of real property in this or indeed in other jurisdictions which have a developed code of property valuation. <br\/><br\/>Any alternative would introduce significant volatility into the rating system, which yields in the region of\u00a0 &euro;1.3bn annually in funding to local authorities, would further delay the national revaluation programme, would be very challenging to implement and would more than likely result in the introduction of an economic valuation system no longer based on property valuations but would become a type of economic audit of the business sector totally unsuitable for application as a base for local government funding.  There must\u00a0be an appropriate balance\u00a0between the costs of\u00a0 rates for SMEs and the availability of adequate levels of\u00a0funding\u00a0to local authorities for the provision of essential local services enjoyed by SMEs and others.<br\/><br\/>It is imperative to maintain certainty and predictability for ratepayers, local authorities and other stakeholders between revaluations which is a fundamental principle of the rating system.  Fluctuations in the economic performance of a company or other entity in occupation of a property would not be measurable in a real estate context and would prove impossible to implement in a fair and equitable way.  The physical characteristics and features of a property are the only criteria that can be surveyed and quantified and which form a uniform basis for rates.  The use of economic factors such as business values and buoyancy may be used for the assessment of other taxes such as VAT and corporate taxes but are not considered to be suitable as a basis for a local property tax.<br\/><br\/>However, I accept\u00a0\u00a0there may be limited circumstances where, because of the restrictive nature of the &quot;material change of circumstances&quot; provisions in the 2001 Act, it may be appropriate to amend a valuation, e.g. where an error occurred, or where a property has been adversely affected by infrastructural development in its vicinity and where the overarching valuation principles of equity and uniformity would ordain that such a revision should be carried out.Should such an eventuality occur, there is now, for the first time, provision in the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012 for the Commissioner of Valuation to address such anomalies.  This measure, introduced in response to submissions made by stakeholders during the consultation process, has been roundly welcomed.<br\/><br\/>The Bill, which was initiated in the Seanad, recently passed Report\u00a0and Final Stages in that House and will now proceed to the D&aacute;il for its consideration.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600077#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Valuations","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600077#WRK00450"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[45402\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600077#WRK00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he provide detail of the commercial rates liability of semi State companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Net annual value is the rental for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes and charges (if any) payable by or under any enactment in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property <\/p><p>  Various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV\/rental value) of a building.

Of this total, tractors were involved in the fatalities of five of these children under seven years old.<br\/><br\/>The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing occupational safety and health law and promoting and encouraging accident prevention. It has conducted extensive campaigns to improve farm safety and to emphasise that children should not be placed at risk. A Code of Practice on Preventing Accidents to Children and Young Persons in Agriculture was first published in 2001. It was revised and re-issued in 2010, following the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. The Farm Safety Partnership, an advisory committee to the Board of the Authority involving farmer representative organisations, assisted in the drafting and revision of the Code of Practice on Preventing Accidents to Children and Young Persons in Agriculture. Central to this code of practice is the principle that only children between the age of 7 and 16 may be carried in the cab of tractors or other farm machinery, and if carried must only be carried if on a seat with a lap belt provided.  <br\/><br\/>In 2008, the Authority launched an information Sheet on <b><i>Child Safety on the Farm. <\/i><\/b>A national farm safety awareness-raising programme run in primary schools resulted in the publication in 2013 of a children&rsquo;s book &lsquo;<b><i>Only a Giant Can Lift a Bull&rsquo;<\/i><\/b>which was sent to all primary schools and public libraries. <br\/><br\/>While all workplace fatalities are tragic, the death of a child is even more so, particularly as in most cases these fatalities arise out of farm work activity carried out close to the home.

From time to time, officials of the Department attend MAC meetings to brief the Committee on particular issues. An official also attends the meetings to provide secretarial support. During the period 2011 &ndash; 2014, the Committee has met on a weekly basis other than in exceptional circumstance, when due to other diary commitments, a meeting had to be deferred. The Committee does not meet in the month of August. I attend the meetings periodically as does the Minister of State. I am also in daily contact with individual MAC members on a range of issues.

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives. The Act also ensures the enhancement of high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.<\/p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas. It has the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.<\/p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013\/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter. <\/p><p>  The Minister is aware that a campaign by the staff associations not to pay the fee is actively underway and is concerned regarding the possible implications for the health service and patient safety should this action continue.  The Department of Health requested the Board to give this matter very careful consideration at its meeting of the 19th November, with a view to agreeing and implementing a course of action most likely to achieve a satisfactory outcome. <\/p><p>  The Minister for Health continues to monitor the situation closely and has asked NMBI and the staff associations to continue these discussions in order to seek a satisfactory resolution in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600081#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Expenditure","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600082#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[45420\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600082#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the hardship and consequences of the proposed cut of &euro;44,437.50 to the budget of the Kerry Parents and Friends Association (details supplied); if he will ensure that these cuts are reversed; his views on the future viability of the Kerry Parents and Friends Association; and his further views on the tremendous service provided by the Kerry Parents and Friends Association","asker":"1047","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Government is fully committed to ensuring the on-going delivery of vital services and supports to people with disabilities within available resources.  <br\/><br\/>The Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently in the process of preparing its 2015 National Service Plan including its disability services programme for children and adults with disabilities. <br\/><br\/>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy on Kerry Parents &amp;amp; Friends Association, as this is a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

We have therefore always looked forward to being able to recognise a state of Palestine, in reality and not just as a symbolic gesture.<\/p><p>  Successive governments and Ministers for Foreign Affairs have considered that a state of Palestine, and Ireland&rsquo;s recognition of it, should come about as part of a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.  All our actions remain geared to that ultimate goal.<\/p><p>  Sweden&rsquo;s recent decision to recognise Palestine has brought this issue to the fore within the EU.  In a number of Member States, including Ireland, there have been strong parliamentary expressions of support for recognition &ndash; in most cases as an element of an overall solution.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council which I attended last week began a discussion among EU partners about the question of recognition, which will continue over time.<\/p><p>  Clearly if there is no prospect of substantive peace talks resuming in the near future, then we will need to take close account of that in evaluating how we can advance our overall goal.<\/p><p>  Our position is not set in stone.  Against the background of a deteriorating situation on the ground, I will continue to consider any option, including early recognition of Palestine, which may advance the prospects for peace and help ensure that the two-state solution still has a chance of being realised.<\/p><p>  Finally, the question of international recognition of Palestine, while important, is not a magic wand to resolve the conflict.  Over 130 countries have already formally recognised Palestine, but the conflict continues.  Only a comprehensive peace agreement will end the occupation and allow the full establishment of a Palestinian state in reality, as well as in theory.  That is the consistent goal of everything the Government is doing on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600084#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600084#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[45478\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600084#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the dates of meetings of his Department's Management Advisory Council in 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; the names of the civil servants present at each of these meetings; state if he or his Department's Minister of State was present at each of these meetings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>I have included in the table below the dates of meetings of my Department's Management Advisory Committee (MAC) in 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014.

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we are working closely with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond towards achieving some relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.  During my visit to the US from 23 September to 1 October I had a wide range of meetings on this important issue with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts, including Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Secretary of State John Kerry.<br\/><br\/>As you are all aware, last Thursday President Obama announced new measures which should benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US.  Pending further possible measures being considered by the US Congress, the President's measures are a step forward which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on immigrants' lives.  The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers (CIIC) have welcomed President Obama's announcement as an important first step in allowing for much needed improvements to the immigration system.  At the core of his proposals is that undocumented immigrants in the US for more than 5 years, who have children who are US citizens or legal residents, who register, go through background checks and pay their taxes, will be protected from deportation and given temporary legal status.  I particularly welcome a provision which, for the first time, albeit under limited conditions, will permit some travel from and to the United States for those undocumented Irish who are eligible to apply under the arrangements President Obama has announced.  <b>Details as to how the travel provision will work in practice have yet to be confirmed but through our Embassy in Washington, we are following up on it directly with the White House and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.<\/b><br\/><br\/>This clearly represents real progress, albeit with further important steps yet to be achieved, and I am happy that the relentless efforts of the Government and our Embassy and diplomatic missions in close partnership with the Irish community in the US have begun to bear fruit.  I am determined that as many Irish nationals as possible will benefit from these changes and, to that end, our missions in the US will continue to work in partnership with the excellent Irish immigration centres there whose work my Department supports.  At the same time, I am by no means complacent about what has yet to be done.  I am well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and that our work to encourage further changes in this area must be pushed forward proactively.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that on immigration reform, as President Obama himself has indicated, there is no substitute for legislative action by Congress.  The government and our Embassy will continue to work with the US Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders.  We already have strong friendships across both aisles in Congress and will keep building our network of friends on Capitol Hill.  Through our Embassy and Consulates in the U.S. and through direct political contacts with the Administration and all sides in Congress, we will continue to encourage further steps that will reflect the concerns and needs of the undocumented Irish and their families, as well as ensuring improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600085#WRS00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":300,"content":"<p>Question No. 106 answered with Question No. 104.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukrainian Conflict","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600085#WRS01000"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[45522\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600085#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the situation in the Ukraine remains to the fore in discussions at EU or UN level; if a facility exists for ongoing dialogue between the Russian and Ukrainian authorities on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>Ending the conflict in Ukraine remains a key priority for the EU.

We have strongly supported the OSCE, including through financial assistance and seconded staff, in their crucial role in both negotiating a ceasefire and monitoring its implementation.

Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), clear systems have been put in place to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible.  Ireland has been playing our part in ensuring these reforms are implemented, so that responses are timely and effective, and meet the most critical, immediate needs.<\/p><p>  In total, over $6.25 billion in global humanitarian funding was provided for the response to the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, far exceeding the original appeal, for $1.4 billion. Ireland pledged &euro;20 million in funding overall for the tsunami response and this pledge was met in full.  The bulk of Ireland's contribution was allocated to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand where damages were greatest and the local capacities to respond were weakest.<\/p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance was pledged by the international community over two years in response to a UN appeal for $1.5 billion.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, $2.38 billion of this had been disbursed; and $3.52 billion by 2014.  For our part, we worked hard to meet Ireland's commitments to the people of Haiti.  By the end of 2012, Ireland's pledge of &euro;13 million had been honoured and exceeded, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million.<\/p><p>  No official pledging conference took place in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan which struck the Philippines in November 2013, but according to the UN's Financial Tracking Service, as of 21st November 2014, more than US$845 million has been contributed by the international community in response to UN appeals. Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to this natural disaster and our contribution to date stands at over &euro;7.1 million.  This includes immediate life-saving emergency response and longer-term recovery and reconstruction support.

This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries and is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.

Fourteen out of thirty-five Chapters have been opened and are now under negotiation.<br\/><br\/>Montenegro began accession negotiations in June 2012 and twelve negotiating Chapters are now open, of which two have been provisionally closed.<br\/><br\/>The European Union began accession negotiations with Serbia on 21 January 2014, and since then, the screening process has been on-going. This process is designed to determine the extent of Serbian alignment with the acquis communautaire. A major focus of negotiations ahead will be on the normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo.<br\/><br\/>Association negotiations with Iceland remain suspended following a decision of the Icelandic Government in early 2013.<br\/><br\/>Macedonia was granted Candidate Status in 2005 but it has yet to open accession negotiations, pending a resolution of the name dispute with Greece.<br\/><br\/>Albania was granted Candidate Status in June 2014. Ireland supported this step as a signal of positive encouragement to the Albanian Government, and the region as a whole, to maintain reform momentum.<br\/><br\/>Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet formally applied for EU membership and thus remains a potential candidate country. In recent years, Bosnia has been seeking to develop an EU coordination mechanism and to revise its complex power-sharing structures to facilitate the participation of minorities in political life.<br\/><br\/>Kosovo has continued negotiations with the European Commission on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step on the EU accession path.  The SAA was initialled in July and future steps will be further discussed early next year.<br\/><br\/>Ireland looks forward to working with each country in support of their respective paths to EU membership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600086#WRT00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600086#WRT00350"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[45525\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600086#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which the European Union continues to support and monitor peaceful coexistence in the western Balkans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

From then all persons employed as teachers in recognised schools must be registered with the Teaching Council, the professional standards body for teachers, in order to be paid by the State.<\/p><p>  More than 90,000 teachers are now registered with the Teaching Council.<\/p><p>  The commencement of Section 30 was widely publicised for several years in advance. In addition, teachers were notified of the changes through their payslips and through targeted communications in the preceding months to outline the change and to encourage registration.<\/p><p>  To continue to be paid from public funds, teachers are advised to maintain their registration with the Teaching Council and to apply to renew their registration in a timely manner. The Teaching Council provides an online renewal service as well as other means for renewal. While it is each teacher's responsibility to ensure their registration is up to date, the Council has a practice of alerting teachers when their renewal date is coming near, and there is a period of one month after the renewal date where late renewals can be processed without affecting the teacher's registration status. I believe these measures are fair and reasonable.<\/p><p>  Alongside Section 30, the Education Act 1998 (Unregistered Persons) Regulations 2014 were also put in place.

These reforms have three main pillars.  The first pillar is a new list of eligible programmes.  The current Internationalisation Register will be replaced by an 'Interim List of Eligible Programmes for Student Immigration Permission' from 1st January 2015.  In line with the strategic priorities identified under the International Education Strategy, only programmes which are accredited or recognised by Irish awarding bodies in the English language and higher education sectors will now be permitted to be listed.<\/p><p>  The second pillar of reform is an enhanced inspection and compliance regime and the third pillar relates to changes to the operation of the work concession.  These reforms are required to protect the educational and consumer interests of genuine international students, to tackle abuse of the labour market and the immigration regime and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers.<\/p><p>  There has been an ongoing consultation in relation to changes to the regulatory and immigration framework in which the international education sector operates.  National policy in this area, signalling regulatory reforms in the sector to relevant stakeholders, is set out in the policy document Investing in Global relationships: Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010-2015, which was first published in September 2010.  The Task Force set up in May 2014 to find solutions for the students affected by the closure of a number of private colleges comprised membership and consultation with a number of key stakeholders including the Irish Council for International Students, the Higher Education Colleges Association, Marketing English in Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Quality and Qualifications Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>  Regarding the application process for QQI recognised courses, provision of private education, including English language training, is not subject to mandatory regulation in the State.  Therefore any person is free to set up a private college of education or a language school without having to come under the oversight of the Department or any of its agencies.  QQI operates ACELS (Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services), which is a voluntary scheme that grants recognition to English language teaching organisations annually.  QQI wrote to all providers who have programmes on the current Internationalisation Register, informing them of the regulatory changes that would be coming into effect and inviting them to apply for ACELS recognition.  All private colleges had the opportunity to apply for ACELS recognition during the period 17th October 2013 to 31st January 2014.<\/p><p>  While my Department has not estimated the number of private colleges which may close as a result of these reforms, I am aware that the strengthening of regulations in this area could lead to further college closures in the short term. In this event, the priority of my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality will be to find a reasonable accommodation for genuine students affected.  However, it is expected that these reforms will have a positive impact in the longer term, as they will significantly enhance the overall quality of Ireland's international education offering, reduce the risk to our reputation from the activities of lower quality operators and enhance the net benefits of internationalisation to the labour market and wider economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600091#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600092#WRZ00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Administration","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600092#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[45540\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600092#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if households will have to verify that they have paid water charges in order to receive the &euro;100 payment from her Department; the way this will be done; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[45541\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600092#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if households currently paying water charges as part of a group water scheme will be eligible for the &euro;100 payment from the Department of Social Protection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[45542\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600092#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to introduce legislation in respect of the &euro;100 payment to offset water charges or if it will be done by means of regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[45456\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600092#WRZ00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the new arrangements pertaining to water charges in the circumstance of a second home; if the &euro;100 conservation rebate will be made available to second home owners in respect of their second homes as well as their principal residences; the charges that will be issued to owners of second homes whose connection is currently switched off but who may wish to reconnect to water services in the future; if the deadline for registration with Irish Water will be extended beyond 30 November 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital. Research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths. The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.<br\/><br\/>In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While my Department keeps the matter under regular review, I have no immediate plans to extend the ban to new towns. However, boundary revisions are currently being prepared in Counties Kildare and Wexford, following consultation with local authorities.<br\/><br\/>Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.<br\/><br\/>Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. The study includes-<blockquote>- an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels;<br \/><br \/>- consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and<br \/><br \/>- an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an  all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels. <\/blockquote>A final report will be presented to the North South Ministerial Council in May 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600093#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Establishment","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600093#WRAA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[45434\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600093#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the value of assets and liabilities that have been transferred from local authorities to Irish Water to date in 2014; the timeframe for the completion of the transfer; the total value of assets and liabilities, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for water services delivery from county and city councils to Irish Water.

Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupier by providing the tenants name. This will allow Irish Water to contact the tenant to complete the registration and to bill the tenant. The tenant will have to register with Irish Water to avail of the water conservation grant or to get lower charges than the default capped charge (&euro;260), where they are single adult occupants or their metered usage is less than the maximum charge.<\/p><p>  Draft legislation which I will be bringing forward will place certain obligations on landlords where the tenant has not paid charges. In the case of tenants in private rented accommodation, the legislation will seek to insert into all tenancy agreements\/leases a deemed obligation on the tenant to discharge their liability for water charges. On the changeover of a tenancy, the registration of a new tenant with Irish Water would be conditional on all water charge arrears being discharged and, in the event of the former tenant not discharging those arrears, the landlord would be entitled to withhold the amount concerned from the tenant&rsquo;s deposit and would be required to remit the amount involved to Irish Water. I have asked my Department to consult with property owner representatives in the course of drafting the legislation.<\/p><p>  In the case of local authority tenants, where deposit arrangements do not apply, and where a customer is in arrears for more than 12 months and a late payment fee has accrued, Irish Water, having firstly provided the customer with the opportunity to pay the arrears or enter into a payment plan, will advise the local authority concerned of the amount of the arrears.

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent). The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012 and extended it nationally in June 2012. The scheme is currently in operation and continues to accept applications from lending institutions.<\/p><p>  A total of 2,558 cases have been submitted to the end of October. 1,034 were ineligible or terminated during the process with a further 46 units not progressing as agreement on the sale could not be reached.  50 transactions have been completed under the scheme.  1,044 are currently with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and the remaining 384 are actively being progressed.<\/p><p>  Separately, my Department has funded 36 cases under the Local Authority scheme to date. The Department currently has 40 LA mortgage to rent applications on hand and expects to receive a small number of additional applications by the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  In an effort to increase the numbers delivered under the AHB scheme a new protocol between all parties in the process was agreed and came into operation in June 2014. The protocol includes such measures as the provision of a single independent valuation for the purpose of agreeing the purchase price. The valuation and condition surveys will now be carried out earlier in the process to give more certainty to all parties in the process, including the borrower. The new protocol is endeavouring to ensure that as much certainty is being provided as early as possible in the process to minimise uncertainty and late withdrawals from the scheme.<\/p><p>  Also in June 2014, my Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within their sector under the LA scheme. There are currently no plans to amend the LA scheme, which is at an early stage of operation, but its workings will be kept under constant review. I am confident that delivery will accelerate as a result of these changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600097#WREE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600097#WREE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[45553\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600097#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his estimate of the payment rate for commercial water rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[45554\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600097#WREE00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount of commercial water charges levied by each local authority in 2013; the amount of outstanding water charges taken on by Irish Water broken down by local authority; the amount written off in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.<br\/><br\/>Data in relation to collection rates for non-domestic water users is contained in the annual Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) Service Indicators report.
