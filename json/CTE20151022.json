There are issues arising with regard to the Office of Government Procurement in particular and to the construction of the tender.  We are back into the same territory we were in that only a one year extension is being granted, such that a new tender will have to be drawn up and so on.  In my opinion, the Office of Government Procurement did not do its job properly, given one of the people who applied for the contract did not even have a licence to operate Galway Airport.  That is a very basic mistake.  The committee has already dealt with this matter in the context of the amount of money involved.  However, I believe it is within the remit of the committee to ask the Department and Office of Government Procurement to appear before it to answer questions in regard to the construction of the tender that is to be re-issued within a short time.<\/p> <p>  The people in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other aviation entities in this country to whom I have spoken about this issue are incredulous with regard to how this could have happened and at the number of basic mistakes made by not only the Office of Government Procurement but the Department.

There is a significant difference between the figures that we received at that time and the figures that are being suggested in the correspondence received from Mr. McKenna.  This is not just general correspondence.  It is backed up by internal correspondence between banks and various parts of the college working out how this project was to be stopped at that time, the warnings that were given and the fact that the costs would be far greater at the end of the day to complete the project.  I understand that the project has still not been completed and to do so will require considerable funding.

He could talk up his sleeve to me then.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Deasy and I visited Moore Street and the general battlefield site on Moore Lane.  I was very impressed by the tour we were given.  I was impressed by the significance of the site, not just in terms of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street but the general area.  Its value as a tourist destination is enormous.  It is as a place where one can sense history as one is told the story while walking through the market.  The area is quite dilapidated, however.  I know that the Project Jewel portfolio is sold and that some of the properties are now in the ownership of the State.  If a sensible approach is taken to the development of the area, some of the other properties that are central to the battlefield area could be saved.  The Government should examine that.<\/p> <p>  It is a policy issue but when we were there we could not help but notice the number of young foreign tourists being brought through the streets, exploring our history.  Many of the buildings are dilapidated and do not represent what we all speak about in the context of our 2016 celebrations next year.  Some of the plaques are in the wrong location and some are quite dated in terms of their presentation and appearance.  From a public interest point of view as well as in terms of the economy and what can be generated by way of tourism, the Minister and the Government should re-examine the battlefield area.  They should examine what the families of the 1916 group are trying to achieve and give an appropriate response.<\/p><p>I ask for the appropriate response.

This was approximately &euro;585 million more than provided for in the original Estimate for the Vote approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Approximately 10% of the total spend in the year was funded through a range of appropriations-in-aid of the Vote, which amounted to &euro;1.34 billion in 2014.  This was &euro;68 million below the amount of receipts forecast in the original Estimate.  The net result was a requirement for Exchequer funding of &euro;12.2 billion for 2014, around &euro;653 million, or 5.6%, more than originally budgeted for.  This budget overrun was met by a Supplementary Estimate in December 2014 which allocated an additional &euro;680 million for the HSE.  The &euro;27 million that remained unspent at the end of the year was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  The budget overrun in 2014, with its consequent Supplementary Estimate, continued a pattern that has extended over many years.  Notes 3 and 4 of the appropriation account provide explanations of significant variances in spending and receipts.  The variance relative to the budget was more significant in some spending and receipts areas than in others.  Members will recall that for 2015, the Vote for health includes Exchequer funding for the Health Service Executive.  Consequently, this is the last appropriation account that will be prepared by the HSE.  It will continue to produce accrual-based annual financial statements.<\/p> <p>  The Accounting Officer has included in the appropriation account a comprehensive statement on the system of internal financial control in place in the HSE.  This reflects the complexity of the HSE as an organisation and the range of services and facilities it provides.  I draw the committee's attention to certain matters dealt with by the Accounting Officer in that statement.  These relate to the extent to which the HSE does not comply with the relevant procurement procedures which are set out in detail in the HSE's national financial regulations.  I have reported previously on this matter in my 2013 annual report.  The committee considered that report on 23 April 2015.  I also draw attention to a comprehensive review by the HSE examining its compliance with tax rules, which was completed in 2014.  The HSE made an unprompted voluntary disclosure to Revenue, including interest and penalties, amounting to &euro;21.6 million in 2014 and &euro;800,000 in 2015.  We have also prepared three reports that deal with areas of HSE activity, which are before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 19 deals with compliance with prompt payment legislation in the HSE in Beaumont Hospital and in St. James's Hospital.  The two hospitals are section 38 bodies funded by the HSE whose financial statements are subject to audit by me.<\/p><p>There are a substantial number of other section 38 bodies that I do not audit.<\/p><p> Legislation providing for automatic penalties for late payment of invoices was first enacted in 1997, in response to concerns about the impact on suppliers, particularly small and medium enterprises, of onerous payment terms and conditions.  The initial provision was for automatic payment of interest by public sector bodies where suppliers had not been paid within 45 days of receipt of an undisputed invoice.  In 2002, late payments were redefined as those not paid within 30 days.  At that time, the legislation was also extended to private companies, as well as public bodies.  Specific contract terms can be agreed with suppliers, allowing longer or shorter credit periods.  The prompt payment legislation was further amended with effect from March 2013, requiring the automatic payment of flat-rate compensation payments of &euro;40, &euro;70 or &euro;100, depending on the value of the invoice, in addition to late payment interest.<\/p><p> In the 2014 audits of the financial statements of the HSE and the two hospitals, we examined compliance with the revised legislation.  In all three cases, we found there was a failure to pay the statutory compensation, even where late payment interest had been paid.  The HSE subsequently recognised in its financial statements a liability to pay compensation to suppliers.  It estimated that this amounted to &euro;9 million in respect of the period from March 2013 to the end of 2014.  As of September 2015, these compensation amounts had not been paid.  Additional liabilities in St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont relating to non-payment of late payment interest and compensation are estimated at &euro;389,000 and &euro;200,000, respectively.<\/p><p> We also found a variation in credit terms in operation within the HSE.  Some HSE areas use a standard credit period of 30 days, while others operate a standard 45-day credit period with suppliers.  Separate payment terms are in place under contracts for payments to nursing homes and drug suppliers, and we noted that the HSE was not late in making payments to nursing home or drug suppliers.  As a result, suppliers to the HSE may not be treated equally.<\/p><p> Chapter 20 looks at another routine business function in the health sector, this time dealing with the collection of income - specifically, the collection by major hospitals of private patient income due from health insurers.  We examined the situation in five hospitals, three of which are HSE managed, namely, Cork University Hospital, University Hospital Galway and Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore.  The others were the two major section 38 hospitals within my remit, namely, St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  Patient income accounted for &euro;410 million of the HSE's total current income in 2014.  Almost three-quarters of this related to charges in respect of private patients, and the bulk of this was recoverable from private health insurers.  Patient income in section 38 hospitals does not form part of the HSE's current income but is taken into account in the funding of these hospitals by the HSE.<\/p><p> New legislation enacted in July 2013 revised the charge rates for private inpatient services that came into effect in January 2014.  There was uncertainty in hospitals about the application of the charges following the commencement of the new legislation, despite the provision of a six-month lead-in period.  The process of clarifying the details, involving the hospitals, the insurers, the HSE and the Department of Health, continued until August 2014.  As a result of the clarifications, additional private patient charges totalling circa &euro;25.7 million had to be levied by hospitals in respect of 2014.<\/p><p> Delays in collecting income due from private health insurers means that the Exchequer is effectively meeting the funding gap at hospitals until payment is made. At the end of 2014, the total private patient debt outstanding from insurance companies was &euro;290 million.  The age of the private patient income debt - calculated in debtor days - was 186 days.  This measure reflects the equivalent number of days' average income the hospitals would have to generate from private treatment of private patients, to accumulate the current outstanding debt level.<\/p><p> At the end of 2014, claims on hand had been with consultants awaiting sign-off for an average of 58 days, up from an average of 43 days at the end of 2013.  Delays in sign-off were longer in HSE hospitals, at an average 68 days, than in the section 38 and voluntary hospitals, where the average was 47 days, a difference of almost one third.  In both sectors, the averages are well above the target of 20 days agreed with consultants as part of a Labour Relations Commission agreement in September 2012.  The HSE noted that the changes in charges implemented in January 2014 had resulted in an increase in the number of claims requiring consultant review, contributing to increasing delays at the consultant sign-off stage during 2014.  The HSE does not currently analyse the value and age of debt awaiting sign off for each individual consultant.<\/p><p> The value of claims queried by insurance companies also increased significantly, by approximately 69%, over the course of 2014.  The sharp increase in queried claims appears to be the result of the changes in the charging regime introduced at the beginning of 2014 and additional information being requested from consultants to justify the length of stay of patients.<\/p><p> Chapter 21 deals with the HSE's control over the supply of high-tech drugs and medicines.  Expenditure by the HSE on the provision of high-tech drugs and medicines was &euro;485 million in 2014, representing an almost 50% increase when compared with 2009.  While the associated patient care fees paid to pharmacists have remained relatively stable at around &euro;17 million a year, payments to the suppliers of drugs and medicines increased from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;468 million in 2014.  The HSE needs to have good controls in place to ensure that all drugs invoiced and paid for have in fact been delivered to pharmacies.  We found that the controls in this regard were not adequate.  Even though the majority of the expenditure on the scheme relates to the purchase of drugs, the checks conducted by the HSE are focused on checking pharmacist&rsquo;s claims rather than supplier invoices.<\/p><p> Excess expenditure can occur where high-tech drugs and medicines delivered to a pharmacy, and paid for by the HSE, are not subsequently used.  This situation can arise, for example, where a patient&rsquo;s prescription changes or where the patient decides to use an alternative pharmacy and the first pharmacy does not have another patient requiring the drug, within the available product life.  In general, pharmacies cannot return unused stock to suppliers or transfer stock to other pharmacies.  At 31 December 2014, the value of stock of high value drugs and medicines held in community pharmacies was just under &euro;45 million.  Returns from individual pharmacies indicated that stock on hands, valued at &euro;2.7 million, had gone out of date.  This, however, is a measure of loss at a point in time, and probably understates the actual level of wastage of high-tech drugs occurring over the course of a year.<\/p><p> The HSE does not require pharmacies to complete declarations of stock disposals or destruction of out-of-date stock.  It also lacks information on the level, cause and cost of wastage due to excess stocks or in respect of the incidence of losses due to patients opting to use a different pharmacy.  Even though the HSE operates an annual programme of pharmacy inspections, it does not conduct independent checks of stock levels in individual pharmacies.  This could be done on a sample rather than a comprehensive basis, for example, checking stocks of specific kinds or brands of drugs.  Instead, the HSE relies for stock information on annual returns by pharmacies, providing details of stock on hand.<\/p><p> In the context of ordering stock, it is important to acknowledge that an appropriate balance must be struck between ensuring that drugs are available to satisfy patient needs in a timely way, while minimising wastage due to excess stock.  In 2011, and again in 2013, the HSE requested pharmacies to co-operate in maximising a just in time facility designed to reduce stock to a level compatible with immediate patient needs.  The examination noted that the stock level in pharmacies at end 2014 was equivalent in value terms to just over a month's supply of stock, which seems high by reference to the frequency of delivery of drugs and the lead time for orders.  On the other hand, the HSE has pointed to complaints that some patients had to wait over a weekend for essential stock to be delivered to their pharmacies.<\/p><p>In all the chapters, we have made recommendations for improvement.  I am glad to note that the HSE has agreed to implement most of these, subject in some cases to practical challenges being overcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McCarthy.

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today's meeting to discuss the 2014 appropriation report and the chapters which have been referenced.  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting.  In my opening statement, I will brief members on the following issues, the first of which is the financial outturn for 2014.<br\/><br\/>The Revised Estimates Volume provided a net Vote Estimate of &euro;11.552 billion for the HSE.  On a like-for-like basis, this amounted to an overall reduction in the gross allocation of &euro;272 million.  It also included total additional savings targets of &euro;619 million, which were required to be achieved in 2014 to deliver the service commitments within the funding available.  In order to maintain existing levels of service, continue to improve patient safety and deliver priority service initiatives within the funding available, significant budget and expenditure reductions were required.  The 2014 national service plan identified the financial risks associated with these reductions and highlighted in particular the scale of the pay and pay-related savings targets being imposed on the system.<br\/><br\/>While many of the efficiency and cost-containment measures delivered substantial savings over the course of the year, it was not possible to realise the required amounts in full.  A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;680 million was passed by the D&aacute;il in December 2014 relating to expenditure pressures, including &euro;390 million for statutory and voluntary services, primarily in the acute hospital sector, &euro;165 million for the primary care reimbursement scheme, PCRS, and other demand led schemes, &euro;55 million for the State Claims Agency, &euro;50 million for patient and miscellaneous receipts and &euro;20 million for statutory pension lump sums. <br\/><br\/>In the period 2008 to 2014, &euro;406 million was allocated to the HSE in net Supplementary Estimates in respect of areas within its direct control.  This equates to 0.49% of the &euro;82.829 billion total original net Vote over the same period.  Some &euro;640 million in Supplementary Estimates was allocated to the HSE in respect of the PCRS, to include medical cards, general practitioner fees, drugs and other demand-led schemes, the dental treatment services scheme, etc., which equates to 0.77% of the &euro;82.829 billion total original net Vote over the period.  Some &euro;1,632 million in Supplementary Estimates was allocated to the HSE in respect of Exchequer-related and other items outside the control of the HSE, which equates to 1.97% of the total.<br\/><br\/>With regard to prompt payments, in the conclusion to Chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, Compliance with Prompt Payment Legislation in the Health Sector, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to a number of issues and made a number of recommendations.  The HSE acknowledges these conclusions and the related recommendations and continues to implement actions to address them.  The HSE wishes to acknowledge that it is fully committed to further improvements in respect of prompt payment, particularly with regard to the liquidity position of the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  Almost half of the payments to vendors in 2014 were for sums of less than &euro;5,000, with only 10% of suppliers receiving payments of &euro;100,000 or more.  It is important to acknowledge the complexity of the work of the HSE in context of payment of its suppliers.  The HSE processes almost 2 million invoices annually to 20,000 suppliers through eight major payment centres using multiple financial payment systems.  Despite these challenges, the HSE in 2014 incurred prompt payment interest of less than 0.01% or &euro;300,000, based on non-pay expenditure of &euro;4.1 billion representing almost 2 million invoices processed.<br\/><br\/>HSE areas that have single systems and locations for the processing of invoices can pay vendors on time and, therefore, do not incur prompt payment interest charges.  Specific examples of this relate to the fair deal and primary care reimbursement schemes where no interest charges arise on a spend of &euro;2.8 billion.  Average payment terms based on analysis of data from our regions that have single systems show that we pay on average within 28 days.  The HSE compares well against other European Union countries as the EU average is currently 36 days.  Further, only 11 of the 26 EU member countries pay within 30-day directive terms.<br\/><br\/>Health business services, HBS, is currently reviewing 45-day payment areas to bring these into line with 30-day payment terms across the HSE.  The HBS team is also engaging with various representative bodies such as the Small Firms Association, IBEC and Chambers Ireland on a regular basis to acknowledge and identify issues for suppliers.  To date, the feedback from these groups indicates that their members are generally satisfied with payment of invoices and prompt payment interest on same.  Thus far, we have not yet been able to secure a meeting with ISME.  The HSE is engaging with the Departments of Health and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with regard to the payment of the prompt payment compensation of &euro;9 million which has been accrued in 2014 for the period from March 2013 to December 2014.<br\/><br\/>On tax compliance, the HSE is the largest employer in the State, with a staff of more than 100,000 and an average annual tax bill of in the region of &euro;1.6 billion.  As part of its commitment to continued improvements in internal controls and compliance, the HSE performed a detailed internal review of its tax heads for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 in order to identify areas of risk in tax compliance.  The HSE worked within the Revenue's co-operative compliance programme to submit a formal unprompted qualifying disclosure of all identified underpayment of taxes.  As a result of this process, the HSE and Revenue Commissioners agreed a full and final payment of underpaid taxes, including penalties and interest of &euro;22.4 million, which was formally accepted by Revenue in August 2015.  This payment amounts to less than 0.05% of the overall budget of the HSE for the years 2011 to 2013, inclusive.  Further, it amounts to around 0.6% of the overall taxes paid in these three years.  More important, this payment has not impacted on the delivery of services.<br\/><br\/>As a result of this tax review, the HSE set up a tax department which is currently being resourced and developed.  Further, the HSE is currently in an agreed process of finalising its internal tax review of 2014 with Revenue.  It is expected that this review will conclude in November of this year.  As the tax review of financial years 2011 through 2012 was not completed and submitted to Revenue until December 2014, the HSE is aware that there may be broadly similar issues arising in 2014 and the expectation is that improvements will start to be reflected in financial year 2015 and will continue into 2016 and beyond.<br\/><br\/>The Comptroller and Auditor General, in Chapter 20 of his report, Management of Private Patient Income in the Health Sector,<i><\/i>made recommendations which the HSE acknowledges.  The HSE will actively work to put in place processes and practices to support these recommendations.  The report highlights specifically the delay the HSE is subject to in receiving private patient income from the main private health insurers.  Currently, the HSE is developing a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the main private health insurers in the Irish market to address outstanding debt issues by negotiating improved payment terms and cash collection for the HSE.  These MOU negotiations commenced in July 2014, initially with the VHI.  Since then, negotiations have been expanded to include Laya, Aviva and GloHealth.  All MOU negotiations are at various stages with all four private insurers. <br\/><br\/>Chapter 20 also contains recommendations relating to integrated claims processing.  Currently, the HSE is utilising the Claimsure claims processing system across 47 of the 48 acute hospitals.  Further, Claimsure can process almost 99% of private insurance claims where the HSE has a direct payment agreement with a private insurer or occupational health scheme such as the ESB, the Prison Officers Medical Aid Society, POMAS, etc.  Claimsure also manages any statutory levy from private insurers where private insured patients opt to be treated publicly.<br\/><br\/>In terms of high-tech drugs and medicines, aggregate spending on medicines under the general medical services, GMS, scheme, direct payment scheme, DPS, and long-term illness scheme has reduced since 2009, despite the growth in numbers with eligibility and the introduction of more expensive new medicines such as new oral anticoagulants, for example.  This is due to a sustained and ongoing programme of price reductions and guidance to prescribers regarding preferred products.  The exception to this pattern is expenditure on high-tech medicines, which increased from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;485 million in 2014 as a consequence of the introduction of highly expensive new medicines and the increased use of existing high-tech medicines.<\/p><p> In the future the expectation is that new medicines will, in the main, be in the high-tech area.  Such medicines are generally only prescribed or initiated in hospital and would include items such as anti-rejection drugs to transplant patients, medicines used in conjunction with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy and medicines for conditions such as cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C, etc.  The medicines are purchased by the Health Service Executive and supplied through community pharmacies, for which pharmacists are paid a patient care fee.  The cost of the medicines and fees are paid for by the primary care reimbursement service.<\/p><p> The challenge in this area &ndash; as in many others - is to ensure that the correct balance is struck between controlling costs on the one hand and ensuring, where possible, that Irish patients have access to new drug therapies as soon as possible after they are developed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the issue is therefore timely and will assist the HSE in managing this growing area of expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>May we publish your statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes, of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues before the committee.  We have met representatives of the HSE for a good few years but there is something very different today.  What the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated was confirmed in the HSE statement.  The HSE's purpose is to deliver the health service to the country but the witnesses have told us it is an organisation not compliant with the taxation rules of the State.  They have told us that the annual report indicates the organisation is not compliant with its own procurement rules.  The HSE's annual financial statement for 2014 confirmed that &euro;56.5 million of contracts were awarded by the HSE without competitive tendering processes.  Shockingly, this figure is up by &euro;38.7 million on the 2013 figure of &euro;17.8 million.  This represents a systemic problem that is deteriorating, based on the HSE's annual financial statements.<\/p> <p>  We have also found out that the HSE has breached prompt payment legislation and there is a compensation issue involving &euro;9 million, which the executive wishes to discuss with the Department of Health.  Moving on, we find the HSE is not in compliance with the guidelines issued by the Department of Health regarding the collection of income from private insurance companies and patients.  As well as that, there is inadequate control over the supply of high-tech medicines, with the taxpayers paying &euro;2.7 million for medicines sitting on a shelf or in a fridge out of date.  We are expected to shrug our shoulders and say nothing about that.  I understand that recently the HSE has cancelled discussions with the Irish pharmaceutical representative association regarding a new contract for medicines.<\/p> <p>  If this is how HSE national governance works and that is how it runs its end of the business, is it any wonder we have a crisis in the health service?  This is the worst catalogue I have seen.  We could just take this as a routine meeting, as we do all the time, as representatives of the HSE appear here regularly, but I have never seen such a bad catalogue of disregard for the laws of the land by a State agency.  I actually asked myself where I should start as we could spend a day on each of those topics.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the taxation issue that has emerged.  I do not have the HSE's audited 2014 financial statements so will the witnesses confirm if the &euro;22.4 million was included in that?  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General has included it in the appropriation account but I do not know if it is in the HSE financial statement.  It is disturbing that the &euro;22.4 million only relates to 2011, 2012 and 2013, and we will return next year to discuss how much money was not paid to the Revenue Commissioners for 2014.  It is obviously continuing this year because the HSE has only recently completed the process for the past three years.  It has indicated that it expects to see improvements in tax compliance to be reflected in 2015 and continuing into 2016.  The HSE has not yet got to the end of the issue.  There is a three-year bill for 2011 to 2013, inclusive, but we do not know the figure for 2014 and 2015.  Based on what the witnesses have said, this will continue to some extent into 2016.  When will the HSE start being tax-compliant?<\/p> <p>  I can understand mistakes in interpretation in contracts for service, for example, but the witnesses must give us a detailed note as to how this arose and how a State body did not get this right to this extent.  I accept the figures from today but I did not like the witness going on, as chief executive of the largest organisation in the country, to in some way minimise this by saying it only represents 0.05% of the budget, or in other words, it is 0.6% of all taxes paid.  I expected a bit of contrition today when the HSE indicated it did not pay its taxes.  The Minister will be coming to the D&aacute;il seeking a Supplementary Estimate for this before the end of the year because the HSE did not meet its taxation liabilities.  We will want to know the liability for this year and 2014.  An effort to come here and almost minimise the issue by saying it is a tiny percentage of the overall figure is not good enough.  If I heard people found not to be properly paying tax, with their names published in the newspaper, whinging about it being only a small amount of tax relative to the tax they paid, I would tell them to get lost, \"'fess up\" and face it.  The witnesses have come in here with a little whinge about it when they should be apologising.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with this as a first question.  Will the witnesses give a run-down on why the HSE did not know how to meet its taxation obligations?  My second question will deal with what is primarily a procurement issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Reference was made in our 2014 accounts to the controls issues and it was a matter of emphasis in the Comptroller and Auditor General's certificate in those accounts.  The HSE is fully compliant in respect of 2011 to 2013, inclusive.  It is important to stress that we are not in any way seeking to minimise our tax issues.  We fully accept it, we wish to be always compliant in tax affairs and we are working to do that.  With the percentages, we are simply trying to reference the context of the scale of the HSE as the largest organisation in the State.<\/p> <p>  It is important to differentiate that this was the HSE operating under its own volition in 2012 to review its tax position, enter into a Revenue Commissioners co-operative compliance programme and make a voluntary, unprompted disclosure within that overall programme.  There is no denying that the HSE had issues in achieving full compliance but we have tried to be up-front in saying that we still have those issues.  However, there is a significant volume of work under way to address that, which we have also referenced.<\/p> <p>  There is a variety of different tax heads and we can certainly provide the detail.  The payment comprises &euro;18 million in tax and &euro;4 million in interest and penalties.  Of the &euro;18 million paid in tax, &euro;14 million amounts to payroll taxes; the bulk of that - we can provide the figure - is a delayed payment of employer's PRSI.  That is not an additional payment but one which the HSE would have had to pay and has paid, albeit late, under this programme.  The VAT payment is approximately &euro;2.5 million over the three years.  That is not an additional cost borne by the HSE but a cost that the HSE would have had to pay in overall terms.  This is not to minimise the issue but the tax payment has, unfortunately, increased our deficit but has not been paid for out of direct service budgets.<\/p><p>Despite the challenges around our myriad systems, to which we will come, we are working to improve tax compliance.  The level of awareness is significant and while we are obviously only concerned with dealing with our own tax issues, on which we are working, it is not true to state the Health Service Executive is the only public body that has made an underpayment of tax to Revenue.  While I am simply trying to give this as the overall context, we take this very seriously and are working to improve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Mulvany to send us a detailed note on this issue.

The witnesses heard my comment that the HSE's annual report noted how &euro;56.5 million in contracts had been awarded by the executive without a competitive tendering process.  Moreover, this figure has escalated to being much worse than in the previous year.  I refer to the area of procurement, albeit not specifically about these breaches.  I wish to discuss a television programme which all members saw some months ago.  The witnesses will remember the programme to which I refer, the subject of which was Eurosurgical Limited contracts.  I note that some of the hospitals identified are HSE hospitals, including St. Columcille's and Mullingar hospitals - there may be others - in which there was an issue regarding what were called kickbacks as shown in the aforementioned RTE programme for arranging procurement orders from a medical supplier.  I am merely citing the contents of a public television programme.  Some of it concerned the private sector, where the staff members concerned were dealt with promptly because it was a serious breach of their contract of employment.  Am I correct in stating those employees paid by the taxpayer through the HSE, including those in St. Vincent's University Hospital which was mentioned and is funded by the taxpayer - are still on the payroll, despite what happened, as shown in the aforementioned television programme?  Is the taxpayer still paying the salary or a payment in lieu of salary where the person concerned is not actually at work at this time?  The witnesses should contrast this with what happened at the Beacon Hospital, a private company that also was implicated in the same programme in similar circumstances.  Why does the HSE continue to pay the people involved?  It was a gross breach of any person's contract of employment.  The witnesses might also indicate the current status of the HSE's investigation because shortly after this issue had emerged, the Minister announced that the HSE would suspend all payments to the company in question.  Did this happen?  Obviously, this is a major systemic issue if it has happened in several bodies, some of which are HSE hospitals, while others are hospitals funded by the HSE and the taxpayer.

It is a big issue.  Given that NAMA and the State Claims Agency handle it sometimes, we ask them about it and sometimes we ask Mr. O'Brien about it.  In a nutshell, the figures presented to us today for 2014 show that at the end of 2013, the estimated outstanding liability was &euro;1.084 billion.  I am taking that directly from the figures.  During the course of the year, in respect of that liability, &euro;134 million was paid out to the State Claims Agency.  They are HSE figures.  The liability at the end of 2014, based on the figures before us, was &euro;1.227 billion.  That shows that the estimated liabilities increased by &euro;273 million during the year.  The figure went up &euro;143 million.  During the year, we paid out &euro;130 million.  That means that an extra &euro;273 million came into the system in 2014, which seems a very high figure given that there was only &euro;1 billion there to start with and it probably covers cases going back over many years.  I know that all Mr. O'Brien does is write the cheque that the State Claims Agency asks for and we put it into Supplementary Estimates, as Mr O'Brien said we did last year.  We will probably have to do the same again.<\/p> <p>  Mr O'Brien might send us back information.  He might have to talk to the State Claims Agency for an estimate of the breakdown of that new &euro;273 million that went on in 2014 and the breakdown between compensation to people for medical negligence and the other legal costs that are associated with that.  We have seen on several occasions in the past that the legal and other costs associated with a claim can be 50% on top of the costs and, ultimately, one third of the total payment.  Mr. O'Brien might comment but also send us his best analysis.  I worry about that figure because nobody is responsible for it.  It happened in the HSE, the State Claims Agency manages it, and we are here to settle the price.  The State Claims Agency does not feel ownership of getting the best value for money because it happened in Mr. O'Brien's department.  He has no involvement, to some extent, in the final settlement, because it is over to the HSE.  I am afraid that from the taxpayer's point of view, nobody feels complete ownership of this problem because it is split between the two areas.

There are controls in place for high-tech medicines - the subject of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  There is room for improvement and the report contains five recommendations which are implementing and which will strengthen them.<\/p> <p>  The issue in high-tech areas, as in most others, is finding the balance between supplying a service on which patients who need drugs and medicines can rely and control.  Approximately 30,000 patients rely on the delivery of high-tech medicines every week and month across the 1,800 pharmacies around the country.  Typically, they include patients with cystic fibrosis or multiple sclerosis, MS; transplant patients who need anti-rejection medications and some very serious metabolic disorder cases.  They tend to be the sickest patients in our system and are very reliant on a reliable supply of medicines.  As the report also pointed out, it is a growth area.  Expenditure is increasing, contrary to what is happening in most other areas where we are securing substantial cost reductions.  Therefore, controls are important, although supply is also very important and the first priority.<\/p> <p>  We implement stock controls and the just-in-time delivery principles and provide stock management guidance for pharmacies.  The aim is to minimise the level of out-of-date stock.  It often occurs for very understandable reasons.<\/p><p>Patients' circumstances change.  They go into hospital, often at short notice, and pharmacies are left with stock on hand that, perhaps, they are unable to use.  Our efforts with the pharmacies are to try to minimise that to the greatest extent possible.

Incidentally, we have already commenced the implementation of those.<\/p><p> While the level of out-of-date stock sounds high at &euro;2.7 million, it represents approximately 0.5% of our expenditure on high-tech medicines.  That is not to underestimate it.

They were non-generic and branded, but they were forgeries.  There should be no temptation whatever to sell out-of-date stock to a customer.  The code of practice in the retail trade regarding the sell-by date is very clear that stock is taken off shelves and discarded.  That is commendable, lest there be any temptation to reduce the sell-by date stock.  There is a margin in retailing where sell-by date stock is dumped out in the retail business, so I compliment the level of caution and care.  If sell-by date stock might be a risk to the patient and there were an over-rigorous control whereby sell-by date stock would be given out to patients, it would be outrageous.  I am pleased that it is the reverse.<\/p> <p>  As a retailer, I am aware of the amount of stock that is thrown out by every retailer in the country.  Where the sell-by date is down from two weeks, they take it off two or three days beforehand.  The margin in the report is very low.  In the retail trade the margin can be considerably higher.  It is a demand-led system.  The stock might not sell to customers so one must take it off the shelves and put it in the dustbin or shred it.  That level of discretion is very commendable.<\/p> <p>  Finally, with regard to the GPs and the contracts with the new primary care centres, how does the witness view participation in that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#O00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Obviously, we would prefer if it was better than it is at present.

The first is the public policy stand.  The main reason the committee took on this issue was to weed out any potential conflicts of interest when it came to very serious cases and incidents, particularly regarding the care of children.  The committee has been dealing with specific incidents or circumstances for the past year.  That is the public policy part of the issue that is being dealt with.  I genuinely appreciate the work everyone has put into this.  It is good work which will help to protect children in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  The second strand is related to the senior counsel who, I understand, has been appointed to examine certain aspects of this matter.  The individual in question will not examine everything because we have issues with regard to the terms of reference.  We will allow the senior counsel to do his or her work.  <\/p> <p>  The third strand is the release of the Conal Devine report.  The landscape keeps changing in this regard.  I refer to the response the Chairman received from the Garda when he asked whether criminal prosecutions would be taken.  It was clearly indicated to him that there would not be criminal prosecutions.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions has made clear that there will not be any criminal prosecutions in this case, one must ask what is the problem with releasing the report.  It is now my understanding that the Office of the Information Commissioner has investigated this issue.  A senior investigator who examined the matter under the Freedom of Information Act found that the reasons for non-publication of the Conal Devine report were completely different from the reasons cited previously.  It is interesting to note what the investigator found.  I will read out fragments of the findings because it is important that members are aware of this information given that we have been dealing with the issue for the past year.  In a lengthy decision letter, the senior investigator outlined that the HSE did not present any meaningful argument to the Information Commissioner as to why the report should be exempted from release owing to the ongoing Garda investigation.<\/p><p>Indeed, the senior investigator found that the mere assertion that release of the report will affect ongoing investigations without explaining precisely why or how the harm to these investigations will occur from the release of the report is inadequate.  In respect of justification for refusing access to the report, it was stated that it was the view of the senior investigator that the non-personal parts of the report do not contain any information which would give rise to any of the harms envisaged by this section of the Act.  Nothing in those parts could, if released under freedom of information, be reasonably expected to prejudice or impair any Garda investigation.  Accordingly, the investigator found that the HSE was not justified in refusing access to the report under this section of the Act.  <\/p><p> I learned this last night and it changes the rationale and reasons we have always been given when it comes to the non-publication of this report.  It is my understanding that one of the individuals involved will now get the recommendations of the Conal Devine report almost intact and some general information.  This will be released to that individual.  Where are we going with this?  We dealt with Mr. Breslin a couple of weeks ago.  This committee is not going to stop.  The excuse that is now being given is that third-party information is involved in this that would be potentially injurious under the Data Protection Act.  That has been thrown into the mix.  Where is the HSE with regard to this?  How does it see this going when it comes to the ultimate publication in its entirety in an unredacted form?  Our intention has been made clear over the past two or three months to Mr. Breslin and he accepted that we are not going to stop until we get the publication of that report because we think it is important in the public interest for that report to be published and viewed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#P02600","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue because when we were last here, it would have been possible to leave the room with the view that we were saying that we were constrained by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that members of the committee had completely contrary information to that and, therefore, we were in some way saying things that the committee did not accept to be true.  In order to be able to give the committee the most up-to-date information, I asked for a full briefing note from Arthur Cox, the lawyers dealing with this matter on behalf of the HSE, and I can circulate the note to the committee, if it wishes me to do so.

In this context by letter dated 26 March 2015 we wrote to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enclosing a copy of the Conal Devine Report with suggested redactions.  We indicated that it was the intention of the HSE to publish the Report and requested that they revert if they had any objection to the release of the Report.  <br \/><br \/>3. When we received the Resilience Ireland Report, we also sent a copy of that Report with suggested redactions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by letter dated 15 April 2015 and requested that they revert if they had any objection to the release of the Report.<br \/><br \/>4. On 30 April 2015, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na raised queries which were addressed by us on 1 May 2015, and the consideration of the matter was then passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legal section.  We suggested further redactions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote to us to request that the HSE &quot;<i>hold off on publishing<\/i>&quot; the Report pending a reply from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's legal section.  <br \/><br \/>5. We sent follow-up letters to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Resilience Ireland Report on 2 June 2015 and in relation to the Conal Devine Report on 19 June 2015 and in relation to both Reports on 23 July 2015.<br \/><br \/>6. On 7 August 2015, we received a letter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 31 July 2015 which stated &quot;<i>regarding the release of the Conal Devine Report and the Resilience Ireland Report I am to inform you that, at this time, we do have concerns that the release may adversely affect ongoing investigations<\/i>&quot;.  By way of response dated 13 August 2015, we told An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that &quot;<i>we have advised the HSE of your correspondence and confirm the HSE does not propose to release the Report at this time<\/i>&quot;.  We requested that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na update us if the position in relation to publication changed and in particular if\/when the investigations concluded.<br \/><br \/>7. In addition an Addendum Report to the Resilience Ireland Report was furnished to us on 10 September 2015.  We carried out appropriate similar redactions in line with the earlier Reports and furnished the Addendum Report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by letter dated 14 October 2015.  In our letter of that date to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we also sought an update as to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na position in relation to the publication of the Report and asked for an update as to if\/when the investigations might conclude.<\/blockquote> <p>That is the most up-to-date position we have.  By sharing it with the committee, it may be clearer that we are in a position of wanting to publish the reports.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of the FOI request, the same correspondence stated that:<\/p><blockquote>8. On 30 September 2015, the Office of the Information Commissioner (&quot;OIC&quot;) furnished us with its review in relation to an appeal by an FOI requester seeking access to the Conal Devine Report under the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.  The HSE had initially not granted access to the Report for a number of reasons, primarily because of the confidentiality rights of third parties having regard to the sensitive personal information that is contained in the Report.<br \/><br \/>9. The OIC decision was that the HSE is to release certain parts of the Report i.e. the methodology and recommendations of the Report (to the extent such parts do not contain any personal information of service users).<br \/><br \/>10. As you know, disclosure of the documentation is expressly stated by the OIC (in their decision letter of 30 September 2015) to be subject to appeal to the High Court by any person affected by the decision of the OIC.  Subject to any appeal by any relevant party, the disclosure will be made in due course pursuant to the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 on 24 November 2015 (i.e. 8 weeks after the OIC decision).  As you know, we have notified relevant parties of the decision.<\/blockquote> <p>That is in both respects the most up-to-date information we have available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>From what Mr. O'Brien said, and there are two parts to it, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is making it clear that its investigation has not been completed but at the same time, this individual is actually going to get parts of this report and its recommendations.

As such, there is a certain amount of the &euro;290 million which one would expect to see.  Given the complexity of the bills, we would expect it to take 13 or so days to issue that bill and the insurer should have about 30 days to pay it.  As such, approximately 60 of what I think is 184 or 186 days would be the norm.  Everything beyond that, which is by far the biggest part of it, is unacceptable to us.  If one looks at the four components of that, there is an administrative piece where we are filling out the form before we bring it to the consultant to sign.  That piece, we have, in fairness, steadily improved to reduce the amount of days .  We measure this in debtor days, the number of days, so we can compare hospitals.  That is because the picture across hospitals is very variable.  We have steadily reduced that to the stage where our target is 15 days for all of that administrative processing.  The actual average in 2014 was 16 days.  The introduction of the claim assure system, which we can talk about more if the Deputy wishes, has assisted us significantly in that respect.  The second piece is the time spent for our own consultants to review and fill out the second part of the form, which is the clinical part, and sign off.

At the end of the chapter, the debtor days per hospital, which I think is what the Deputy was asking me about earlier, are set out.  The graphic shows the age of the private debt by individual hospital.  Statutory hospitals are in light blue while the voluntary or section 38 hospitals are in dark blue.  The Deputy will see that there is very considerable variation.  For Tallaght Hospital, it is approximately 85 debtor days equivalent whereas University Hospital Galway is in excess of 200 days.  The next graphic shows the private in-patient debt in hospitals awaiting consultant action.  This is a subset of the debt.  This is the amount that is awaiting action.

One can get tired of listening to the toing and froing that happens between Deputies but according to Mr. Mulvany's explanation, the HSE has failed to bring consultants into line.  The Committee of Public Accounts has had this discussion with the HSE previously.  The committee has heard all of the explanations about what is required to be done to make consultants comply.  While we are talking about a significant amount of money it is also a problem for the process.  When the HSE finally submits a bill to the private insurer, from those consultants who have not signed off for years, there is bound to be a query.  If I received an invoice for a job done two or three years ago I would have difficulty in paying it and would take a double look at it.  Yet the HSE has consultants in hospitals who ignore the HSE's endeavours to settle bills.  Am I correct in my understanding that the HSE provides somebody with an iPad to chase these consultants to sign off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#U01700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Yes, Chairman, that is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#U01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I understand the predicament in which the HSE finds itself - these people are consultants and it is not easy to replace them - but if this was to happen anywhere else something would be done.  Someone would lose their job.  However, because the taxpayer is picking up the bill everyone is fine with just an explanation.  I do not wish to be personal, Mr. Mulvany, and sometimes Mr. O'Brien takes my comments personally but my comments are not personal nor are they said for political reasons.  I am here to do a job and I wear my PAC hat, not my political party hat nor my opposition hat.<\/p> <p>  I find that the explanation which has gone around this room time and time again is now at a point where it is ridiculous.  This is why people ask questions about the HSE and its processes.  If consultants have performed operations or carried out medical procedures for which they have not claimed payment for two years then there is something seriously wrong.  Why not introduce a system whereby should that form not be signed, there would be interest and penalties applied to the amount due to the consultant just as when one's taxes are not paid.  As penalties are introduced and moneys are withheld from the hospital it would impact negatively on cashflow and then the patients would suffer.  Patients are currently being asked to bring their own pillows and bed-linen into hospital and to clean up under their bed after previous patients.  This is happening in some hospitals while at the same time there is this farcical situation that for years consultants have not signed off with one signature.  Mr. O'Brien has said it is a huge task for consultants to get up to date on the process of signing off.<\/p> <p>  Then there is the other problem with the private health insurers when these old invoices arrive as there is nothing that can be done.  It is probably pointless asking the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about whether it has a plan because it probably has no plan.

There would be queries justifying length of stay, provision of medical notes as to whether a patient had a pre-existing condition or why particular treatments were given or other information relating to the consultant.  Apart from kicking ass as part of the response, we can deconstruct the problem and say that if we are not getting the correct information on the claim at the beginning, it will result in a query.

The area I wish to speak of is the internal financial control system, and we have been talking about that for many years at this stage.  Representatives of the Department of Health were here two weeks ago and I was informed that it will take at least another five years.  I also asked about skill sets in the Department.  I was told there are four accountants, three data analysts and two statisticians.  The previous question related to collecting money and managing data, which seems to be a big problem, but where are we in getting an integrated system that is robust and can share information?  We have spoken about consultants signing off forms but could this be done online or in a process that integrates technology to make it easier for users?  My colleagues may not be very complimentary to some of our consultants but we need them and there is a shortage.  Would it not be a better approach to make it easier for them to do their job?  I agree with the Chairman that perhaps we need to outsource the existing backlog and get it cleared up as soon as possible.  I am sure there are some very good accountancy firms around the country that would be more than happy to help.  There are also companies looking after outsourced data management.<\/p> <p>  What percentage of the &euro;13.5 billion budget is going to innovation and putting in place new processes to help doctors and nurses on the ground?  I am a regular user of the health service who goes in every month and I still see a very large brown file with all the information in it that nobody could read in one sitting.  There are many mistakes in it and I am asked the same questions by four different people.  This is so far away from conversations about lean management, processes and technology.  This is probably one of the most fundamental issues in the system but I am not a clinician, so I cannot speak about it from that perspective.  I comment from the perspective of managing processes, building the capabilities of a team and enabling people to give accurate information on time.  I presume that would help with decision-making processes in how we can go further and ensuring that the Health Service Executive corporate plan can be implemented by its 2017 target.  I cannot see that happening without technology supporting all the services provided by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#V02900","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>With regard to making the process easier for consultants, the unfortunate reality is we have made it easier.  Consultants can sign their forms online and we have implemented a system, and although it is not yet integrated with every billing system, it has been integrated with the vast majority of the necessary systems in hospitals.  That has led to improvements in the administrative side, which the Deputy mentioned.  It also means that, largely, we do not have paper around the overall claims process.  Consultants may sign online and there are billing companies that consultants can and do use to do practically everything but the signature.  Unfortunately, the issue is not about making it much easier for the consultants - it may the case with some examples - it is largely about attitude and culture in getting the form signed.  We have done all that.<\/p> <p>  We completely agree with the Deputy on the need for an integrated financial and procurement system.  We are making progress on that.

If one thinks about it, any financial system the HSE is going to have which we also want to use for our bigger funded agencies will have about 10,000 users; therefore, it is a large undertaking.  If one takes three key work streams, in the next year we see ourselves as being able to upgrade significantly what we call our business intelligence reporting tools.  As the Deputy can imagine, there are many old legal systems, from which we are drawing information using what is quite an old reporting tool.  We intend in the next year to upgrade it when we will have greater and quicker access to some of our data.  At the same time, we are making progress in seeking approval around the single large national and financial procurement system.  We will spend the next year, once we get approval, going through the procurement process which is obviously necessary for an investment of this scale.  Projects of this nature need to be approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  If they are large enough, as this one is, one requires what is called a peer review by an appointed panel.  We had the business case meeting with it last week and would say it was quite positive.  We are hopeful of receiving approval in the next while from what is, in effect, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to actually go to tender for the new national system.  We are already working with the Office of Government Procurement on the preliminary stages.  As I said, the tendering process, unfortunately, will take most of a year to complete.<\/p> <p>  At the same time - this is the third piece - we are seeking to do the following.  We have a number of quite old legacy systems, particularly from the five former health boards across the western seaboard, the south and south east.  Our intent in the next couple of years, using our existing frameworks, is to upgrade these systems to make them safe and at least have a single platform.  That will take us about two years to complete, until the end of 2017 or early 2018.  We will then move, subject to necessary approval and the allocation of funding, to a single national financial system.  This will take in the order of five years to complete.  I think the Secretary General mentioned a period of five to eight years.  We hope to be in and out in around five years and will do so in less time, if we can.  What we are trying to demonstrate is that we will see improvements in the next year when we improve the reporting system.  We will see greater safety in stabilising the existing five legal systems along the western seaboard and in the southern part of the country.  At the same time we hope that by the end of next year we will have completed the procurement process and selected the overall platform to be used to enable us to drive on to a single integrated national financial system.  It is a painful process; it has been difficult in the past few years, but our sense now is that we are very well connected with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that there is a governance process stretching to all three.  I am satisfied that we will get approval and move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>May I ask Mr. Mulvany's about his team?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Is it being managed internally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00400","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>It is being managed internally, but, obviously, we will be using and have used external support.

There is wastage in hospitals.  We have been addressing this in recent years.  At the national distribution centre we have introduce point-of-use management.  The idea is that procurement people manage at the point of use, not the clinicians.  Clinicians are busy trying to get back to their patients and so on and we have taken that workload away from them.  We have introduced Kanban, a point-of-use management system.  This involves the management of stock at the point of use and it reduces the wastage.  In other words, we introduce materials requirement planning into the ward and there is assessment of the stock required at ward level on an ongoing basis rather than on a weekly or fortnightly basis.  Even if a ward was to reduce or change its function in some way, we can amend the arrangements to bring in the required stock.  This is being received well by clinicians.  We have been able to measure it in Tullamore.  The nurses there gave us the facts.  Between four and six hours per week per ward of clinical time was transferred back to front-line activity, and that is only in respect of the time of clinicians.  The actual reduction of inventory that we have seen ranges between 30% and 45%.  That is where we get our savings from.  This is monitored on a daily basis with clinicians and active management.  We are bringing that forward.<\/p> <p>  We reckon there are approximately 600 locations where point-of-use management can be introduced throughout the HSE.  At this stage, 50% of that target is already completed.  As we roll the national distribution centre operation into full implementation we will be taking care of the other 300 locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#BB02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Swords"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Is there statistical evidence of improvement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#BB02300","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.  We have the statistical evidence on the reduction of inventory in the first instance.  There is a culture change as well because people are habitual by nature.

We know that 7% is the industrial norm and we are meeting that at a minimum.  This is significant given the stockholding arrangements of any major hospital.<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of obsolete stock, which is where Deputy Dowds may be referencing or going ahead to.

They point to the inconsistencies and discretionary budget allocations across the different HSE regions.  As a result of that, they suffer from a poor consistency in the delivery of services.  In fact, in a border constituency such as Carlow-Kilkenny with its Laois border at Graiguecullen beside Carlow, there are often turf disputes over how services are delivered on the Laois side and on the Carlow side, depending on where one lives.  Deputy Sean Fleming has encountered this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#CC00700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I am an expert on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#CC00800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Regardless of the efforts that are made through the HSE, the answer is always, \"Yes, you can get that service in the other administrative area [which might be in the Carlow side] but there will be a funding issue\".  That is despite the fact that the funding issue has already been addressed by virtue of the fact that the patient or client is receiving the services within the HSE area but across the border.  These issues appear to be easy to resolve but they have been around for as long as I have been dealing with them.  Will you kindly address that in the context of the letter you received?<\/p> <p>  The other fact the groups point to is the gaps in early assessment and the waiting times of more than one year for vital services such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology.  These are placing children with disabilities at risk of regression and denying them the chance to reach their full potential.  The groups go on to point to the figures they recently obtained from the HSE.  There are 1,940 children waiting in excess of one year for speech and language assessment.  A further 2,983 have already been assessed as requiring the service but they are on the waiting list for at least a year without receiving the treatment.  In addition, 2,090 children are waiting at least 12 months for an OT service, which is essential to assist them in accomplishing everyday tasks such as eating, dressing or writing, and 7,301 people, including children, are waiting for more than one year to receive physiotherapy.  Eleven local health areas remain without an early intervention team.<\/p> <p>  They are drawing attention to this and have asked the Committee of Public Accounts to get from the HSE, in a clear, legible format, the total allocated budget in each of the areas of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology, a breakdown by each of the four HSE areas for children with disabilities for each year from January 2011 up to now and to deal with the actual spend, that is, what the budget was, what was actually spent and a breakdown within the areas.  You should be able to get that for us.<\/p> <p>  They include in their submission a letter from a parent, which explains it quite well.  They talk about the services that are available for children aged 16 to 18.  Amanda is a seven year old girl with Down syndrome.  She has been diagnosed with moderate intellectual disability, moderate visual impairment and she has an ongoing cardiac condition.  She has been under the services of St. Catherine's Association in Wicklow since her birth.  However, she was under the care of the HSE in a pilot programme at the time the letter was written.  At that time there was no speech and language therapy and no occupational therapy being offered.  When she had initial contact with the multi-disciplinary team, it said that there would be one therapy session per term.  The day the parent attended to have that explained to her, without the child, it was considered to be one of the therapy sessions for that year.  The parent has another child of four years of age, typically developed with slight problems of pronunciation and so forth.  As that child was in a different age group she got eight weeks of one-to-one treatment.  However, the child that required it most got none.<\/p> <p>  That case, without highlighting any more of it, spells out the dilemma in which that family and the groups find themselves.  As it involves services, cost of services and so forth, I ask, on their behalf, that the time would be taken by somebody to analyse what is said in the submission, what is being delivered on the ground and to give the figures associated with each and every request in it.  That is not unreasonable.  I could table a string of parliamentary questions but that is not what is required here.

This is compensation which was believed to be due to suppliers in respect of the period from March 2013 to the end of 2014, so it is part of the overall prompt payments legislation.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states, we had taken advice on that which, as far as we are concerned, indicated that we were complying with legislation by not automatically paying that compensation payment to the supplier.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made us aware of the views of the Attorney General.  Obviously, we do not have the Attorney General's advice, nor would it necessarily be appropriate that we would or any questions the Attorney General was asked, but based on the engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General we provided for that &euro;9 million in our accounts.  However, since then we have been reviewing the legal position very carefully.  We have asked our legal service department to go through all the legislation back to the original prompt payments legislation, and all of the EU directive legislation, and that advice confirms to us that we are legally compliant.  The legislation, in our view, confers upon the supplier an entitlement to obtain both the interest and the compensation.  It does not differentiate.  Unlike the earlier prompt payments legislation, this legislation is different.  In reality, we automatically pay the interest.  We do not wait for suppliers to seek it.  We automatically pay it, which may well be beyond the legal requirement, but we do that and do not intent to change doing that.  We accept the principle of seeking to avoid cash liquidity to the small and medium enterprise sector in particular, and the principle of complying with the legislation.<\/p><p>However, our difficulty with our current systems concerns the notion of transferring &euro;9 million effectively to private suppliers who have an entitlement to seek it but who have not sought it.

Again, it concerns payment from hospitals.  It is something I came across and I believe it is unfair, and that is why I am raising it here.  I received correspondence in relation to an issue to do with the payment for a bed and breakfast, which is a service that is widely used by hospitals when consultants visit and need to be kept.  A lady came to me because she was not paid.  The reply from the hospital, St. Luke's, was on 6 May 2015.  The lady issued a letter of response clarifying all the points raised by the hospital in relation to the payment on this account.  I asked a parliamentary question and followed up with letters on 14 July, 20 August and 22 September.  None of those letters has been replied to by the hospital.  What I find mean about it is that not only was the bed and breakfast in question not paid when it raised the question of the outstanding invoice based on the belief that it was properly booked because the person in question was familiar with how it is booked and has worked closely with the HSE, the business went in the direction outlined.  Therefore, the bed and breakfast lady was penalised twice for raising the query.  On top of that, everyone heads to a solicitor.

There is no particular additional cost but one hospital group embarked on something of a rebranding exercise.  Others have not done so and we do not intend that they should, beyond minor adjustments to letterheads as they are renewed in the ordinary course.

The HSE recovered &euro;220 million in 2013 and &euro;172 million in 2014, a reduction in the year of &euro;48 million.  I understand this is primarily related to people from the United Kingdom who are resident here and would be entitled to free medical and hospital care if they were living in the UK.  Under EU rules, they are then entitled to avail of free care if they are living in Ireland.  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this topic and I am on record as having raised this issue previously.  There is an arrangement in place between the Irish and UK authorities, whereby the UK authorities will pay a sum to Ireland based on the number of UK citizens living here.  I understand the figure is net and may be based on a figures of approximately 40,000 people.  According to a reply I received to a parliamentary question, new negotiations were to take place because the calculation used was based an old figure.  I do not believe the negotiations have been finalised.  Both sides probably require help from the Central Statistics Office or other bodies to work out the correct figure and ascertain whether we are receiving what is due to us.  <\/p> <p>  This issue was brought to my attention by a man who visited my office and informed me that, having lived in England, he was entitled to free hospital care here and was not required to pay for outpatient appointments, accommodation, overnight stays or accident and emergency charges.  I wondered how this could be the case.  He informed me that the British Government pays Ireland for this and that hospital care was free of charge for him.  I was surprised to learn that 40,000 people or more are entitled to completely free hospital care in the public service, whereas Irish people must pay for it.  I ask the witnesses to talk us through the figures.  Is it correct that English people in Ireland have free hospital care whereas Irish people must pay charges?

They were proceeding, and many people thought they would be concluded in recent weeks, but that is not happening.

The IPHA is a federation for some of the suppliers.  It comes in and talks to the HSE.  Would the HSE not be better off talking to all the companies on a one-to-one basis because it would strike a better deal?  If there are 20 companies, the HSE can separate them and work one off against the other as opposed to them all coming together as part of the one federation and agreeing not to step on each other's toes and to send in somebody who is not working for any of the companies.  I have said here previously that we are setting prices that the taxpayer will pay without any direct contact with the people from whom we are buying.  I will cite an example I used previously.  It is like the Minister wanting to deal with the banks about an issue and talking to the Irish Bankers' Federation instead of the banks.

The option of putting in place an intermediate distribution system is complicated by the very short shelf life of some of the products and the requirement for a continuous cold chain.  Any time taken to send products to a central point for onward distribution would eat into the shelf life.  Typically, and this is where the \"just in time\" aspect of the matter arises, most patients who are in receipt of high-tech drugs are doing so for a course of treatment, or even sometimes for continuous treatment.  That means there is a capacity to plan.  The variability comes in with the human factor.  I refer to circumstances in which, without the knowledge of the supply system, an individual patient might make a last-minute decision to discontinue with the medication, or may be hospitalised and therefore unavailable to have it in the community, or may make the decision to change pharmacy.

Was the conference in question the only one attended by Mr. O'Brien that was paid for by a private company while he was acting as the head of the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#KK05600","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#KK05700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":910,"content":"<p>That was the only one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#KK05800","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":911,"content":"<p>Yes, it was actually the first conference outside Ireland that I attended as head of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#KK05900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":912,"content":"<p>Fine.

The resulting vacancy for the national director of mental health will soon be advertised in an open competition.  Ms Laverne McGuinness, who sometimes appears here, is moving on after 20 years with the health service, having been head-hunted by the private sector.  We wish her well.  Her successor will be appointed on the basis of an open competition.  One cannot become a national director except by means of an open competition.  It is sometimes limited to the health family, as was the case when the directorate was established and the sanction limited recruitment to people who were already employed in one of the health agencies.  As individual posts become vacant, I can and do, on occasion, exercise my discretion to fill them by redeployment from among my top team, and then fill the resulting vacancy by open competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#LL00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":934,"content":"<p>Yesterday, a young man spoke on a local radio station and complained that his father was recovering in a public ward at St. Luke's General Hospital and that the patient next to him was smoking continuously.
