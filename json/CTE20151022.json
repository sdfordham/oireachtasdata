There are issues arising with regard to the Office of Government Procurement in particular and to the construction of the tender.  We are back into the same territory we were in that only a one year extension is being granted, such that a new tender will have to be drawn up and so on.  In my opinion, the Office of Government Procurement did not do its job properly, given one of the people who applied for the contract did not even have a licence to operate Galway Airport.  That is a very basic mistake.  The committee has already dealt with this matter in the context of the amount of money involved.  However, I believe it is within the remit of the committee to ask the Department and Office of Government Procurement to appear before it to answer questions in regard to the construction of the tender that is to be re-issued within a short time.<\/p> <p>  The people in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other aviation entities in this country to whom I have spoken about this issue are incredulous with regard to how this could have happened and at the number of basic mistakes made by not only the Office of Government Procurement but the Department.

There is a significant difference between the figures that we received at that time and the figures that are being suggested in the correspondence received from Mr. McKenna.  This is not just general correspondence.  It is backed up by internal correspondence between banks and various parts of the college working out how this project was to be stopped at that time, the warnings that were given and the fact that the costs would be far greater at the end of the day to complete the project.  I understand that the project has still not been completed and to do so will require considerable funding.

He could talk up his sleeve to me then.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Deasy and I visited Moore Street and the general battlefield site on Moore Lane.  I was very impressed by the tour we were given.  I was impressed by the significance of the site, not just in terms of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street but the general area.  Its value as a tourist destination is enormous.  It is as a place where one can sense history as one is told the story while walking through the market.  The area is quite dilapidated, however.  I know that the Project Jewel portfolio is sold and that some of the properties are now in the ownership of the State.  If a sensible approach is taken to the development of the area, some of the other properties that are central to the battlefield area could be saved.  The Government should examine that.<\/p> <p>  It is a policy issue but when we were there we could not help but notice the number of young foreign tourists being brought through the streets, exploring our history.  Many of the buildings are dilapidated and do not represent what we all speak about in the context of our 2016 celebrations next year.  Some of the plaques are in the wrong location and some are quite dated in terms of their presentation and appearance.  From a public interest point of view as well as in terms of the economy and what can be generated by way of tourism, the Minister and the Government should re-examine the battlefield area.  They should examine what the families of the 1916 group are trying to achieve and give an appropriate response.<\/p><p>I ask for the appropriate response.

This was approximately &euro;585 million more than provided for in the original Estimate for the Vote approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Approximately 10% of the total spend in the year was funded through a range of appropriations-in-aid of the Vote, which amounted to &euro;1.34 billion in 2014.  This was &euro;68 million below the amount of receipts forecast in the original Estimate.  The net result was a requirement for Exchequer funding of &euro;12.2 billion for 2014, around &euro;653 million, or 5.6%, more than originally budgeted for.  This budget overrun was met by a Supplementary Estimate in December 2014 which allocated an additional &euro;680 million for the HSE.  The &euro;27 million that remained unspent at the end of the year was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  The budget overrun in 2014, with its consequent Supplementary Estimate, continued a pattern that has extended over many years.  Notes 3 and 4 of the appropriation account provide explanations of significant variances in spending and receipts.  The variance relative to the budget was more significant in some spending and receipts areas than in others.  Members will recall that for 2015, the Vote for health includes Exchequer funding for the Health Service Executive.  Consequently, this is the last appropriation account that will be prepared by the HSE.  It will continue to produce accrual-based annual financial statements.<\/p> <p>  The Accounting Officer has included in the appropriation account a comprehensive statement on the system of internal financial control in place in the HSE.  This reflects the complexity of the HSE as an organisation and the range of services and facilities it provides.  I draw the committee's attention to certain matters dealt with by the Accounting Officer in that statement.  These relate to the extent to which the HSE does not comply with the relevant procurement procedures which are set out in detail in the HSE's national financial regulations.  I have reported previously on this matter in my 2013 annual report.  The committee considered that report on 23 April 2015.  I also draw attention to a comprehensive review by the HSE examining its compliance with tax rules, which was completed in 2014.  The HSE made an unprompted voluntary disclosure to Revenue, including interest and penalties, amounting to &euro;21.6 million in 2014 and &euro;800,000 in 2015.  We have also prepared three reports that deal with areas of HSE activity, which are before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 19 deals with compliance with prompt payment legislation in the HSE in Beaumont Hospital and in St. James's Hospital.  The two hospitals are section 38 bodies funded by the HSE whose financial statements are subject to audit by me.<\/p><p>There are a substantial number of other section 38 bodies that I do not audit.<\/p><p> Legislation providing for automatic penalties for late payment of invoices was first enacted in 1997, in response to concerns about the impact on suppliers, particularly small and medium enterprises, of onerous payment terms and conditions.  The initial provision was for automatic payment of interest by public sector bodies where suppliers had not been paid within 45 days of receipt of an undisputed invoice.  In 2002, late payments were redefined as those not paid within 30 days.  At that time, the legislation was also extended to private companies, as well as public bodies.  Specific contract terms can be agreed with suppliers, allowing longer or shorter credit periods.  The prompt payment legislation was further amended with effect from March 2013, requiring the automatic payment of flat-rate compensation payments of &euro;40, &euro;70 or &euro;100, depending on the value of the invoice, in addition to late payment interest.<\/p><p> In the 2014 audits of the financial statements of the HSE and the two hospitals, we examined compliance with the revised legislation.  In all three cases, we found there was a failure to pay the statutory compensation, even where late payment interest had been paid.  The HSE subsequently recognised in its financial statements a liability to pay compensation to suppliers.  It estimated that this amounted to &euro;9 million in respect of the period from March 2013 to the end of 2014.  As of September 2015, these compensation amounts had not been paid.  Additional liabilities in St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont relating to non-payment of late payment interest and compensation are estimated at &euro;389,000 and &euro;200,000, respectively.<\/p><p> We also found a variation in credit terms in operation within the HSE.  Some HSE areas use a standard credit period of 30 days, while others operate a standard 45-day credit period with suppliers.  Separate payment terms are in place under contracts for payments to nursing homes and drug suppliers, and we noted that the HSE was not late in making payments to nursing home or drug suppliers.  As a result, suppliers to the HSE may not be treated equally.<\/p><p> Chapter 20 looks at another routine business function in the health sector, this time dealing with the collection of income - specifically, the collection by major hospitals of private patient income due from health insurers.  We examined the situation in five hospitals, three of which are HSE managed, namely, Cork University Hospital, University Hospital Galway and Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore.  The others were the two major section 38 hospitals within my remit, namely, St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  Patient income accounted for &euro;410 million of the HSE's total current income in 2014.  Almost three-quarters of this related to charges in respect of private patients, and the bulk of this was recoverable from private health insurers.  Patient income in section 38 hospitals does not form part of the HSE's current income but is taken into account in the funding of these hospitals by the HSE.<\/p><p> New legislation enacted in July 2013 revised the charge rates for private inpatient services that came into effect in January 2014.  There was uncertainty in hospitals about the application of the charges following the commencement of the new legislation, despite the provision of a six-month lead-in period.  The process of clarifying the details, involving the hospitals, the insurers, the HSE and the Department of Health, continued until August 2014.  As a result of the clarifications, additional private patient charges totalling circa &euro;25.7 million had to be levied by hospitals in respect of 2014.<\/p><p> Delays in collecting income due from private health insurers means that the Exchequer is effectively meeting the funding gap at hospitals until payment is made. At the end of 2014, the total private patient debt outstanding from insurance companies was &euro;290 million.  The age of the private patient income debt - calculated in debtor days - was 186 days.  This measure reflects the equivalent number of days' average income the hospitals would have to generate from private treatment of private patients, to accumulate the current outstanding debt level.<\/p><p> At the end of 2014, claims on hand had been with consultants awaiting sign-off for an average of 58 days, up from an average of 43 days at the end of 2013.  Delays in sign-off were longer in HSE hospitals, at an average 68 days, than in the section 38 and voluntary hospitals, where the average was 47 days, a difference of almost one third.  In both sectors, the averages are well above the target of 20 days agreed with consultants as part of a Labour Relations Commission agreement in September 2012.  The HSE noted that the changes in charges implemented in January 2014 had resulted in an increase in the number of claims requiring consultant review, contributing to increasing delays at the consultant sign-off stage during 2014.  The HSE does not currently analyse the value and age of debt awaiting sign off for each individual consultant.<\/p><p> The value of claims queried by insurance companies also increased significantly, by approximately 69%, over the course of 2014.  The sharp increase in queried claims appears to be the result of the changes in the charging regime introduced at the beginning of 2014 and additional information being requested from consultants to justify the length of stay of patients.<\/p><p> Chapter 21 deals with the HSE's control over the supply of high-tech drugs and medicines.  Expenditure by the HSE on the provision of high-tech drugs and medicines was &euro;485 million in 2014, representing an almost 50% increase when compared with 2009.  While the associated patient care fees paid to pharmacists have remained relatively stable at around &euro;17 million a year, payments to the suppliers of drugs and medicines increased from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;468 million in 2014.  The HSE needs to have good controls in place to ensure that all drugs invoiced and paid for have in fact been delivered to pharmacies.  We found that the controls in this regard were not adequate.  Even though the majority of the expenditure on the scheme relates to the purchase of drugs, the checks conducted by the HSE are focused on checking pharmacist&rsquo;s claims rather than supplier invoices.<\/p><p> Excess expenditure can occur where high-tech drugs and medicines delivered to a pharmacy, and paid for by the HSE, are not subsequently used.  This situation can arise, for example, where a patient&rsquo;s prescription changes or where the patient decides to use an alternative pharmacy and the first pharmacy does not have another patient requiring the drug, within the available product life.  In general, pharmacies cannot return unused stock to suppliers or transfer stock to other pharmacies.  At 31 December 2014, the value of stock of high value drugs and medicines held in community pharmacies was just under &euro;45 million.  Returns from individual pharmacies indicated that stock on hands, valued at &euro;2.7 million, had gone out of date.  This, however, is a measure of loss at a point in time, and probably understates the actual level of wastage of high-tech drugs occurring over the course of a year.<\/p><p> The HSE does not require pharmacies to complete declarations of stock disposals or destruction of out-of-date stock.  It also lacks information on the level, cause and cost of wastage due to excess stocks or in respect of the incidence of losses due to patients opting to use a different pharmacy.  Even though the HSE operates an annual programme of pharmacy inspections, it does not conduct independent checks of stock levels in individual pharmacies.  This could be done on a sample rather than a comprehensive basis, for example, checking stocks of specific kinds or brands of drugs.  Instead, the HSE relies for stock information on annual returns by pharmacies, providing details of stock on hand.<\/p><p> In the context of ordering stock, it is important to acknowledge that an appropriate balance must be struck between ensuring that drugs are available to satisfy patient needs in a timely way, while minimising wastage due to excess stock.  In 2011, and again in 2013, the HSE requested pharmacies to co-operate in maximising a just in time facility designed to reduce stock to a level compatible with immediate patient needs.  The examination noted that the stock level in pharmacies at end 2014 was equivalent in value terms to just over a month's supply of stock, which seems high by reference to the frequency of delivery of drugs and the lead time for orders.  On the other hand, the HSE has pointed to complaints that some patients had to wait over a weekend for essential stock to be delivered to their pharmacies.<\/p><p>In all the chapters, we have made recommendations for improvement.  I am glad to note that the HSE has agreed to implement most of these, subject in some cases to practical challenges being overcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McCarthy.

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today's meeting to discuss the 2014 appropriation report and the chapters which have been referenced.  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting.  In my opening statement, I will brief members on the following issues, the first of which is the financial outturn for 2014.<br\/><br\/>The Revised Estimates Volume provided a net Vote Estimate of &euro;11.552 billion for the HSE.  On a like-for-like basis, this amounted to an overall reduction in the gross allocation of &euro;272 million.  It also included total additional savings targets of &euro;619 million, which were required to be achieved in 2014 to deliver the service commitments within the funding available.  In order to maintain existing levels of service, continue to improve patient safety and deliver priority service initiatives within the funding available, significant budget and expenditure reductions were required.  The 2014 national service plan identified the financial risks associated with these reductions and highlighted in particular the scale of the pay and pay-related savings targets being imposed on the system.<br\/><br\/>While many of the efficiency and cost-containment measures delivered substantial savings over the course of the year, it was not possible to realise the required amounts in full.  A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;680 million was passed by the D&aacute;il in December 2014 relating to expenditure pressures, including &euro;390 million for statutory and voluntary services, primarily in the acute hospital sector, &euro;165 million for the primary care reimbursement scheme, PCRS, and other demand led schemes, &euro;55 million for the State Claims Agency, &euro;50 million for patient and miscellaneous receipts and &euro;20 million for statutory pension lump sums. <br\/><br\/>In the period 2008 to 2014, &euro;406 million was allocated to the HSE in net Supplementary Estimates in respect of areas within its direct control.  This equates to 0.49% of the &euro;82.829 billion total original net Vote over the same period.  Some &euro;640 million in Supplementary Estimates was allocated to the HSE in respect of the PCRS, to include medical cards, general practitioner fees, drugs and other demand-led schemes, the dental treatment services scheme, etc., which equates to 0.77% of the &euro;82.829 billion total original net Vote over the period.  Some &euro;1,632 million in Supplementary Estimates was allocated to the HSE in respect of Exchequer-related and other items outside the control of the HSE, which equates to 1.97% of the total.<br\/><br\/>With regard to prompt payments, in the conclusion to Chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, Compliance with Prompt Payment Legislation in the Health Sector, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to a number of issues and made a number of recommendations.  The HSE acknowledges these conclusions and the related recommendations and continues to implement actions to address them.  The HSE wishes to acknowledge that it is fully committed to further improvements in respect of prompt payment, particularly with regard to the liquidity position of the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  Almost half of the payments to vendors in 2014 were for sums of less than &euro;5,000, with only 10% of suppliers receiving payments of &euro;100,000 or more.  It is important to acknowledge the complexity of the work of the HSE in context of payment of its suppliers.  The HSE processes almost 2 million invoices annually to 20,000 suppliers through eight major payment centres using multiple financial payment systems.  Despite these challenges, the HSE in 2014 incurred prompt payment interest of less than 0.01% or &euro;300,000, based on non-pay expenditure of &euro;4.1 billion representing almost 2 million invoices processed.<br\/><br\/>HSE areas that have single systems and locations for the processing of invoices can pay vendors on time and, therefore, do not incur prompt payment interest charges.  Specific examples of this relate to the fair deal and primary care reimbursement schemes where no interest charges arise on a spend of &euro;2.8 billion.  Average payment terms based on analysis of data from our regions that have single systems show that we pay on average within 28 days.  The HSE compares well against other European Union countries as the EU average is currently 36 days.  Further, only 11 of the 26 EU member countries pay within 30-day directive terms.<br\/><br\/>Health business services, HBS, is currently reviewing 45-day payment areas to bring these into line with 30-day payment terms across the HSE.  The HBS team is also engaging with various representative bodies such as the Small Firms Association, IBEC and Chambers Ireland on a regular basis to acknowledge and identify issues for suppliers.  To date, the feedback from these groups indicates that their members are generally satisfied with payment of invoices and prompt payment interest on same.  Thus far, we have not yet been able to secure a meeting with ISME.  The HSE is engaging with the Departments of Health and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with regard to the payment of the prompt payment compensation of &euro;9 million which has been accrued in 2014 for the period from March 2013 to December 2014.<br\/><br\/>On tax compliance, the HSE is the largest employer in the State, with a staff of more than 100,000 and an average annual tax bill of in the region of &euro;1.6 billion.  As part of its commitment to continued improvements in internal controls and compliance, the HSE performed a detailed internal review of its tax heads for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 in order to identify areas of risk in tax compliance.  The HSE worked within the Revenue's co-operative compliance programme to submit a formal unprompted qualifying disclosure of all identified underpayment of taxes.  As a result of this process, the HSE and Revenue Commissioners agreed a full and final payment of underpaid taxes, including penalties and interest of &euro;22.4 million, which was formally accepted by Revenue in August 2015.  This payment amounts to less than 0.05% of the overall budget of the HSE for the years 2011 to 2013, inclusive.  Further, it amounts to around 0.6% of the overall taxes paid in these three years.  More important, this payment has not impacted on the delivery of services.<br\/><br\/>As a result of this tax review, the HSE set up a tax department which is currently being resourced and developed.  Further, the HSE is currently in an agreed process of finalising its internal tax review of 2014 with Revenue.  It is expected that this review will conclude in November of this year.  As the tax review of financial years 2011 through 2012 was not completed and submitted to Revenue until December 2014, the HSE is aware that there may be broadly similar issues arising in 2014 and the expectation is that improvements will start to be reflected in financial year 2015 and will continue into 2016 and beyond.<br\/><br\/>The Comptroller and Auditor General, in Chapter 20 of his report, Management of Private Patient Income in the Health Sector,<i><\/i>made recommendations which the HSE acknowledges.  The HSE will actively work to put in place processes and practices to support these recommendations.  The report highlights specifically the delay the HSE is subject to in receiving private patient income from the main private health insurers.  Currently, the HSE is developing a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the main private health insurers in the Irish market to address outstanding debt issues by negotiating improved payment terms and cash collection for the HSE.  These MOU negotiations commenced in July 2014, initially with the VHI.  Since then, negotiations have been expanded to include Laya, Aviva and GloHealth.  All MOU negotiations are at various stages with all four private insurers. <br\/><br\/>Chapter 20 also contains recommendations relating to integrated claims processing.  Currently, the HSE is utilising the Claimsure claims processing system across 47 of the 48 acute hospitals.  Further, Claimsure can process almost 99% of private insurance claims where the HSE has a direct payment agreement with a private insurer or occupational health scheme such as the ESB, the Prison Officers Medical Aid Society, POMAS, etc.  Claimsure also manages any statutory levy from private insurers where private insured patients opt to be treated publicly.<br\/><br\/>In terms of high-tech drugs and medicines, aggregate spending on medicines under the general medical services, GMS, scheme, direct payment scheme, DPS, and long-term illness scheme has reduced since 2009, despite the growth in numbers with eligibility and the introduction of more expensive new medicines such as new oral anticoagulants, for example.  This is due to a sustained and ongoing programme of price reductions and guidance to prescribers regarding preferred products.  The exception to this pattern is expenditure on high-tech medicines, which increased from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;485 million in 2014 as a consequence of the introduction of highly expensive new medicines and the increased use of existing high-tech medicines.<\/p><p> In the future the expectation is that new medicines will, in the main, be in the high-tech area.  Such medicines are generally only prescribed or initiated in hospital and would include items such as anti-rejection drugs to transplant patients, medicines used in conjunction with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy and medicines for conditions such as cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C, etc.  The medicines are purchased by the Health Service Executive and supplied through community pharmacies, for which pharmacists are paid a patient care fee.  The cost of the medicines and fees are paid for by the primary care reimbursement service.<\/p><p> The challenge in this area &ndash; as in many others - is to ensure that the correct balance is struck between controlling costs on the one hand and ensuring, where possible, that Irish patients have access to new drug therapies as soon as possible after they are developed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the issue is therefore timely and will assist the HSE in managing this growing area of expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>May we publish your statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes, of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues before the committee.  We have met representatives of the HSE for a good few years but there is something very different today.  What the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated was confirmed in the HSE statement.  The HSE's purpose is to deliver the health service to the country but the witnesses have told us it is an organisation not compliant with the taxation rules of the State.  They have told us that the annual report indicates the organisation is not compliant with its own procurement rules.  The HSE's annual financial statement for 2014 confirmed that &euro;56.5 million of contracts were awarded by the HSE without competitive tendering processes.  Shockingly, this figure is up by &euro;38.7 million on the 2013 figure of &euro;17.8 million.  This represents a systemic problem that is deteriorating, based on the HSE's annual financial statements.<\/p> <p>  We have also found out that the HSE has breached prompt payment legislation and there is a compensation issue involving &euro;9 million, which the executive wishes to discuss with the Department of Health.  Moving on, we find the HSE is not in compliance with the guidelines issued by the Department of Health regarding the collection of income from private insurance companies and patients.  As well as that, there is inadequate control over the supply of high-tech medicines, with the taxpayers paying &euro;2.7 million for medicines sitting on a shelf or in a fridge out of date.  We are expected to shrug our shoulders and say nothing about that.  I understand that recently the HSE has cancelled discussions with the Irish pharmaceutical representative association regarding a new contract for medicines.<\/p> <p>  If this is how HSE national governance works and that is how it runs its end of the business, is it any wonder we have a crisis in the health service?  This is the worst catalogue I have seen.  We could just take this as a routine meeting, as we do all the time, as representatives of the HSE appear here regularly, but I have never seen such a bad catalogue of disregard for the laws of the land by a State agency.  I actually asked myself where I should start as we could spend a day on each of those topics.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the taxation issue that has emerged.  I do not have the HSE's audited 2014 financial statements so will the witnesses confirm if the &euro;22.4 million was included in that?  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General has included it in the appropriation account but I do not know if it is in the HSE financial statement.  It is disturbing that the &euro;22.4 million only relates to 2011, 2012 and 2013, and we will return next year to discuss how much money was not paid to the Revenue Commissioners for 2014.  It is obviously continuing this year because the HSE has only recently completed the process for the past three years.  It has indicated that it expects to see improvements in tax compliance to be reflected in 2015 and continuing into 2016.  The HSE has not yet got to the end of the issue.  There is a three-year bill for 2011 to 2013, inclusive, but we do not know the figure for 2014 and 2015.  Based on what the witnesses have said, this will continue to some extent into 2016.  When will the HSE start being tax-compliant?<\/p> <p>  I can understand mistakes in interpretation in contracts for service, for example, but the witnesses must give us a detailed note as to how this arose and how a State body did not get this right to this extent.  I accept the figures from today but I did not like the witness going on, as chief executive of the largest organisation in the country, to in some way minimise this by saying it only represents 0.05% of the budget, or in other words, it is 0.6% of all taxes paid.  I expected a bit of contrition today when the HSE indicated it did not pay its taxes.  The Minister will be coming to the D&aacute;il seeking a Supplementary Estimate for this before the end of the year because the HSE did not meet its taxation liabilities.  We will want to know the liability for this year and 2014.  An effort to come here and almost minimise the issue by saying it is a tiny percentage of the overall figure is not good enough.  If I heard people found not to be properly paying tax, with their names published in the newspaper, whinging about it being only a small amount of tax relative to the tax they paid, I would tell them to get lost, \"'fess up\" and face it.  The witnesses have come in here with a little whinge about it when they should be apologising.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with this as a first question.  Will the witnesses give a run-down on why the HSE did not know how to meet its taxation obligations?  My second question will deal with what is primarily a procurement issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Reference was made in our 2014 accounts to the controls issues and it was a matter of emphasis in the Comptroller and Auditor General's certificate in those accounts.  The HSE is fully compliant in respect of 2011 to 2013, inclusive.  It is important to stress that we are not in any way seeking to minimise our tax issues.  We fully accept it, we wish to be always compliant in tax affairs and we are working to do that.  With the percentages, we are simply trying to reference the context of the scale of the HSE as the largest organisation in the State.<\/p> <p>  It is important to differentiate that this was the HSE operating under its own volition in 2012 to review its tax position, enter into a Revenue Commissioners co-operative compliance programme and make a voluntary, unprompted disclosure within that overall programme.  There is no denying that the HSE had issues in achieving full compliance but we have tried to be up-front in saying that we still have those issues.  However, there is a significant volume of work under way to address that, which we have also referenced.<\/p> <p>  There is a variety of different tax heads and we can certainly provide the detail.  The payment comprises &euro;18 million in tax and &euro;4 million in interest and penalties.  Of the &euro;18 million paid in tax, &euro;14 million amounts to payroll taxes; the bulk of that - we can provide the figure - is a delayed payment of employer's PRSI.  That is not an additional payment but one which the HSE would have had to pay and has paid, albeit late, under this programme.  The VAT payment is approximately &euro;2.5 million over the three years.  That is not an additional cost borne by the HSE but a cost that the HSE would have had to pay in overall terms.  This is not to minimise the issue but the tax payment has, unfortunately, increased our deficit but has not been paid for out of direct service budgets.<\/p><p>Despite the challenges around our myriad systems, to which we will come, we are working to improve tax compliance.  The level of awareness is significant and while we are obviously only concerned with dealing with our own tax issues, on which we are working, it is not true to state the Health Service Executive is the only public body that has made an underpayment of tax to Revenue.  While I am simply trying to give this as the overall context, we take this very seriously and are working to improve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Mulvany to send us a detailed note on this issue.

The witnesses heard my comment that the HSE's annual report noted how &euro;56.5 million in contracts had been awarded by the executive without a competitive tendering process.  Moreover, this figure has escalated to being much worse than in the previous year.  I refer to the area of procurement, albeit not specifically about these breaches.  I wish to discuss a television programme which all members saw some months ago.  The witnesses will remember the programme to which I refer, the subject of which was Eurosurgical Limited contracts.  I note that some of the hospitals identified are HSE hospitals, including St. Columcille's and Mullingar hospitals - there may be others - in which there was an issue regarding what were called kickbacks as shown in the aforementioned RTE programme for arranging procurement orders from a medical supplier.  I am merely citing the contents of a public television programme.  Some of it concerned the private sector, where the staff members concerned were dealt with promptly because it was a serious breach of their contract of employment.  Am I correct in stating those employees paid by the taxpayer through the HSE, including those in St. Vincent's University Hospital which was mentioned and is funded by the taxpayer - are still on the payroll, despite what happened, as shown in the aforementioned television programme?  Is the taxpayer still paying the salary or a payment in lieu of salary where the person concerned is not actually at work at this time?  The witnesses should contrast this with what happened at the Beacon Hospital, a private company that also was implicated in the same programme in similar circumstances.  Why does the HSE continue to pay the people involved?  It was a gross breach of any person's contract of employment.  The witnesses might also indicate the current status of the HSE's investigation because shortly after this issue had emerged, the Minister announced that the HSE would suspend all payments to the company in question.  Did this happen?  Obviously, this is a major systemic issue if it has happened in several bodies, some of which are HSE hospitals, while others are hospitals funded by the HSE and the taxpayer.

It is a big issue.  Given that NAMA and the State Claims Agency handle it sometimes, we ask them about it and sometimes we ask Mr. O'Brien about it.  In a nutshell, the figures presented to us today for 2014 show that at the end of 2013, the estimated outstanding liability was &euro;1.084 billion.  I am taking that directly from the figures.  During the course of the year, in respect of that liability, &euro;134 million was paid out to the State Claims Agency.  They are HSE figures.  The liability at the end of 2014, based on the figures before us, was &euro;1.227 billion.  That shows that the estimated liabilities increased by &euro;273 million during the year.  The figure went up &euro;143 million.  During the year, we paid out &euro;130 million.  That means that an extra &euro;273 million came into the system in 2014, which seems a very high figure given that there was only &euro;1 billion there to start with and it probably covers cases going back over many years.  I know that all Mr. O'Brien does is write the cheque that the State Claims Agency asks for and we put it into Supplementary Estimates, as Mr O'Brien said we did last year.  We will probably have to do the same again.<\/p> <p>  Mr O'Brien might send us back information.  He might have to talk to the State Claims Agency for an estimate of the breakdown of that new &euro;273 million that went on in 2014 and the breakdown between compensation to people for medical negligence and the other legal costs that are associated with that.  We have seen on several occasions in the past that the legal and other costs associated with a claim can be 50% on top of the costs and, ultimately, one third of the total payment.  Mr. O'Brien might comment but also send us his best analysis.  I worry about that figure because nobody is responsible for it.  It happened in the HSE, the State Claims Agency manages it, and we are here to settle the price.  The State Claims Agency does not feel ownership of getting the best value for money because it happened in Mr. O'Brien's department.  He has no involvement, to some extent, in the final settlement, because it is over to the HSE.  I am afraid that from the taxpayer's point of view, nobody feels complete ownership of this problem because it is split between the two areas.

There are controls in place for high-tech medicines - the subject of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  There is room for improvement and the report contains five recommendations which are implementing and which will strengthen them.<\/p> <p>  The issue in high-tech areas, as in most others, is finding the balance between supplying a service on which patients who need drugs and medicines can rely and control.  Approximately 30,000 patients rely on the delivery of high-tech medicines every week and month across the 1,800 pharmacies around the country.  Typically, they include patients with cystic fibrosis or multiple sclerosis, MS; transplant patients who need anti-rejection medications and some very serious metabolic disorder cases.  They tend to be the sickest patients in our system and are very reliant on a reliable supply of medicines.  As the report also pointed out, it is a growth area.  Expenditure is increasing, contrary to what is happening in most other areas where we are securing substantial cost reductions.  Therefore, controls are important, although supply is also very important and the first priority.<\/p> <p>  We implement stock controls and the just-in-time delivery principles and provide stock management guidance for pharmacies.  The aim is to minimise the level of out-of-date stock.  It often occurs for very understandable reasons.<\/p><p>Patients' circumstances change.  They go into hospital, often at short notice, and pharmacies are left with stock on hand that, perhaps, they are unable to use.  Our efforts with the pharmacies are to try to minimise that to the greatest extent possible.

Incidentally, we have already commenced the implementation of those.<\/p><p> While the level of out-of-date stock sounds high at &euro;2.7 million, it represents approximately 0.5% of our expenditure on high-tech medicines.  That is not to underestimate it.

They were non-generic and branded, but they were forgeries.  There should be no temptation whatever to sell out-of-date stock to a customer.  The code of practice in the retail trade regarding the sell-by date is very clear that stock is taken off shelves and discarded.  That is commendable, lest there be any temptation to reduce the sell-by date stock.  There is a margin in retailing where sell-by date stock is dumped out in the retail business, so I compliment the level of caution and care.  If sell-by date stock might be a risk to the patient and there were an over-rigorous control whereby sell-by date stock would be given out to patients, it would be outrageous.  I am pleased that it is the reverse.<\/p> <p>  As a retailer, I am aware of the amount of stock that is thrown out by every retailer in the country.  Where the sell-by date is down from two weeks, they take it off two or three days beforehand.  The margin in the report is very low.  In the retail trade the margin can be considerably higher.  It is a demand-led system.  The stock might not sell to customers so one must take it off the shelves and put it in the dustbin or shred it.  That level of discretion is very commendable.<\/p> <p>  Finally, with regard to the GPs and the contracts with the new primary care centres, how does the witness view participation in that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#O00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Obviously, we would prefer if it was better than it is at present.

The first is the public policy stand.  The main reason the committee took on this issue was to weed out any potential conflicts of interest when it came to very serious cases and incidents, particularly regarding the care of children.  The committee has been dealing with specific incidents or circumstances for the past year.  That is the public policy part of the issue that is being dealt with.  I genuinely appreciate the work everyone has put into this.  It is good work which will help to protect children in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  The second strand is related to the senior counsel who, I understand, has been appointed to examine certain aspects of this matter.  The individual in question will not examine everything because we have issues with regard to the terms of reference.  We will allow the senior counsel to do his or her work.  <\/p> <p>  The third strand is the release of the Conal Devine report.  The landscape keeps changing in this regard.  I refer to the response the Chairman received from the Garda when he asked whether criminal prosecutions would be taken.  It was clearly indicated to him that there would not be criminal prosecutions.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions has made clear that there will not be any criminal prosecutions in this case, one must ask what is the problem with releasing the report.  It is now my understanding that the Office of the Information Commissioner has investigated this issue.  A senior investigator who examined the matter under the Freedom of Information Act found that the reasons for non-publication of the Conal Devine report were completely different from the reasons cited previously.  It is interesting to note what the investigator found.  I will read out fragments of the findings because it is important that members are aware of this information given that we have been dealing with the issue for the past year.  In a lengthy decision letter, the senior investigator outlined that the HSE did not present any meaningful argument to the Information Commissioner as to why the report should be exempted from release owing to the ongoing Garda investigation.<\/p><p>Indeed, the senior investigator found that the mere assertion that release of the report will affect ongoing investigations without explaining precisely why or how the harm to these investigations will occur from the release of the report is inadequate.  In respect of justification for refusing access to the report, it was stated that it was the view of the senior investigator that the non-personal parts of the report do not contain any information which would give rise to any of the harms envisaged by this section of the Act.  Nothing in those parts could, if released under freedom of information, be reasonably expected to prejudice or impair any Garda investigation.  Accordingly, the investigator found that the HSE was not justified in refusing access to the report under this section of the Act.  <\/p><p> I learned this last night and it changes the rationale and reasons we have always been given when it comes to the non-publication of this report.  It is my understanding that one of the individuals involved will now get the recommendations of the Conal Devine report almost intact and some general information.  This will be released to that individual.  Where are we going with this?  We dealt with Mr. Breslin a couple of weeks ago.  This committee is not going to stop.  The excuse that is now being given is that third-party information is involved in this that would be potentially injurious under the Data Protection Act.  That has been thrown into the mix.  Where is the HSE with regard to this?  How does it see this going when it comes to the ultimate publication in its entirety in an unredacted form?  Our intention has been made clear over the past two or three months to Mr. Breslin and he accepted that we are not going to stop until we get the publication of that report because we think it is important in the public interest for that report to be published and viewed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#P02600","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue because when we were last here, it would have been possible to leave the room with the view that we were saying that we were constrained by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that members of the committee had completely contrary information to that and, therefore, we were in some way saying things that the committee did not accept to be true.  In order to be able to give the committee the most up-to-date information, I asked for a full briefing note from Arthur Cox, the lawyers dealing with this matter on behalf of the HSE, and I can circulate the note to the committee, if it wishes me to do so.

In this context by letter dated 26 March 2015 we wrote to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enclosing a copy of the Conal Devine Report with suggested redactions.  We indicated that it was the intention of the HSE to publish the Report and requested that they revert if they had any objection to the release of the Report.  <br \/><br \/>3. When we received the Resilience Ireland Report, we also sent a copy of that Report with suggested redactions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by letter dated 15 April 2015 and requested that they revert if they had any objection to the release of the Report.<br \/><br \/>4. On 30 April 2015, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na raised queries which were addressed by us on 1 May 2015, and the consideration of the matter was then passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legal section.  We suggested further redactions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote to us to request that the HSE &quot;<i>hold off on publishing<\/i>&quot; the Report pending a reply from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's legal section.  <br \/><br \/>5. We sent follow-up letters to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Resilience Ireland Report on 2 June 2015 and in relation to the Conal Devine Report on 19 June 2015 and in relation to both Reports on 23 July 2015.<br \/><br \/>6. On 7 August 2015, we received a letter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 31 July 2015 which stated &quot;<i>regarding the release of the Conal Devine Report and the Resilience Ireland Report I am to inform you that, at this time, we do have concerns that the release may adversely affect ongoing investigations<\/i>&quot;.  By way of response dated 13 August 2015, we told An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that &quot;<i>we have advised the HSE of your correspondence and confirm the HSE does not propose to release the Report at this time<\/i>&quot;.  We requested that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na update us if the position in relation to publication changed and in particular if\/when the investigations concluded.<br \/><br \/>7. In addition an Addendum Report to the Resilience Ireland Report was furnished to us on 10 September 2015.  We carried out appropriate similar redactions in line with the earlier Reports and furnished the Addendum Report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by letter dated 14 October 2015.  In our letter of that date to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we also sought an update as to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na position in relation to the publication of the Report and asked for an update as to if\/when the investigations might conclude.<\/blockquote> <p>That is the most up-to-date position we have.  By sharing it with the committee, it may be clearer that we are in a position of wanting to publish the reports.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of the FOI request, the same correspondence stated that:<\/p><blockquote>8. On 30 September 2015, the Office of the Information Commissioner (&quot;OIC&quot;) furnished us with its review in relation to an appeal by an FOI requester seeking access to the Conal Devine Report under the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.  The HSE had initially not granted access to the Report for a number of reasons, primarily because of the confidentiality rights of third parties having regard to the sensitive personal information that is contained in the Report.<br \/><br \/>9. The OIC decision was that the HSE is to release certain parts of the Report i.e. the methodology and recommendations of the Report (to the extent such parts do not contain any personal information of service users).<br \/><br \/>10. As you know, disclosure of the documentation is expressly stated by the OIC (in their decision letter of 30 September 2015) to be subject to appeal to the High Court by any person affected by the decision of the OIC.  Subject to any appeal by any relevant party, the disclosure will be made in due course pursuant to the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 on 24 November 2015 (i.e. 8 weeks after the OIC decision).  As you know, we have notified relevant parties of the decision.<\/blockquote> <p>That is in both respects the most up-to-date information we have available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>From what Mr. O'Brien said, and there are two parts to it, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is making it clear that its investigation has not been completed but at the same time, this individual is actually going to get parts of this report and its recommendations.

As such, there is a certain amount of the &euro;290 million which one would expect to see.  Given the complexity of the bills, we would expect it to take 13 or so days to issue that bill and the insurer should have about 30 days to pay it.  As such, approximately 60 of what I think is 184 or 186 days would be the norm.  Everything beyond that, which is by far the biggest part of it, is unacceptable to us.  If one looks at the four components of that, there is an administrative piece where we are filling out the form before we bring it to the consultant to sign.  That piece, we have, in fairness, steadily improved to reduce the amount of days .  We measure this in debtor days, the number of days, so we can compare hospitals.  That is because the picture across hospitals is very variable.  We have steadily reduced that to the stage where our target is 15 days for all of that administrative processing.  The actual average in 2014 was 16 days.  The introduction of the claim assure system, which we can talk about more if the Deputy wishes, has assisted us significantly in that respect.  The second piece is the time spent for our own consultants to review and fill out the second part of the form, which is the clinical part, and sign off.

At the end of the chapter, the debtor days per hospital, which I think is what the Deputy was asking me about earlier, are set out.  The graphic shows the age of the private debt by individual hospital.  Statutory hospitals are in light blue while the voluntary or section 38 hospitals are in dark blue.  The Deputy will see that there is very considerable variation.  For Tallaght Hospital, it is approximately 85 debtor days equivalent whereas University Hospital Galway is in excess of 200 days.  The next graphic shows the private in-patient debt in hospitals awaiting consultant action.  This is a subset of the debt.  This is the amount that is awaiting action.

One can get tired of listening to the toing and froing that happens between Deputies but according to Mr. Mulvany's explanation, the HSE has failed to bring consultants into line.  The Committee of Public Accounts has had this discussion with the HSE previously.  The committee has heard all of the explanations about what is required to be done to make consultants comply.  While we are talking about a significant amount of money it is also a problem for the process.  When the HSE finally submits a bill to the private insurer, from those consultants who have not signed off for years, there is bound to be a query.  If I received an invoice for a job done two or three years ago I would have difficulty in paying it and would take a double look at it.  Yet the HSE has consultants in hospitals who ignore the HSE's endeavours to settle bills.  Am I correct in my understanding that the HSE provides somebody with an iPad to chase these consultants to sign off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#U01700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Yes, Chairman, that is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#U01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I understand the predicament in which the HSE finds itself - these people are consultants and it is not easy to replace them - but if this was to happen anywhere else something would be done.  Someone would lose their job.  However, because the taxpayer is picking up the bill everyone is fine with just an explanation.  I do not wish to be personal, Mr. Mulvany, and sometimes Mr. O'Brien takes my comments personally but my comments are not personal nor are they said for political reasons.  I am here to do a job and I wear my PAC hat, not my political party hat nor my opposition hat.<\/p> <p>  I find that the explanation which has gone around this room time and time again is now at a point where it is ridiculous.  This is why people ask questions about the HSE and its processes.  If consultants have performed operations or carried out medical procedures for which they have not claimed payment for two years then there is something seriously wrong.  Why not introduce a system whereby should that form not be signed, there would be interest and penalties applied to the amount due to the consultant just as when one's taxes are not paid.  As penalties are introduced and moneys are withheld from the hospital it would impact negatively on cashflow and then the patients would suffer.  Patients are currently being asked to bring their own pillows and bed-linen into hospital and to clean up under their bed after previous patients.  This is happening in some hospitals while at the same time there is this farcical situation that for years consultants have not signed off with one signature.  Mr. O'Brien has said it is a huge task for consultants to get up to date on the process of signing off.<\/p> <p>  Then there is the other problem with the private health insurers when these old invoices arrive as there is nothing that can be done.  It is probably pointless asking the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about whether it has a plan because it probably has no plan.

There would be queries justifying length of stay, provision of medical notes as to whether a patient had a pre-existing condition or why particular treatments were given or other information relating to the consultant.  Apart from kicking ass as part of the response, we can deconstruct the problem and say that if we are not getting the correct information on the claim at the beginning, it will result in a query.

The area I wish to speak of is the internal financial control system, and we have been talking about that for many years at this stage.  Representatives of the Department of Health were here two weeks ago and I was informed that it will take at least another five years.  I also asked about skill sets in the Department.  I was told there are four accountants, three data analysts and two statisticians.  The previous question related to collecting money and managing data, which seems to be a big problem, but where are we in getting an integrated system that is robust and can share information?  We have spoken about consultants signing off forms but could this be done online or in a process that integrates technology to make it easier for users?  My colleagues may not be very complimentary to some of our consultants but we need them and there is a shortage.  Would it not be a better approach to make it easier for them to do their job?  I agree with the Chairman that perhaps we need to outsource the existing backlog and get it cleared up as soon as possible.  I am sure there are some very good accountancy firms around the country that would be more than happy to help.  There are also companies looking after outsourced data management.<\/p> <p>  What percentage of the &euro;13.5 billion budget is going to innovation and putting in place new processes to help doctors and nurses on the ground?  I am a regular user of the health service who goes in every month and I still see a very large brown file with all the information in it that nobody could read in one sitting.  There are many mistakes in it and I am asked the same questions by four different people.  This is so far away from conversations about lean management, processes and technology.  This is probably one of the most fundamental issues in the system but I am not a clinician, so I cannot speak about it from that perspective.  I comment from the perspective of managing processes, building the capabilities of a team and enabling people to give accurate information on time.  I presume that would help with decision-making processes in how we can go further and ensuring that the Health Service Executive corporate plan can be implemented by its 2017 target.  I cannot see that happening without technology supporting all the services provided by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#V02900","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>With regard to making the process easier for consultants, the unfortunate reality is we have made it easier.  Consultants can sign their forms online and we have implemented a system, and although it is not yet integrated with every billing system, it has been integrated with the vast majority of the necessary systems in hospitals.  That has led to improvements in the administrative side, which the Deputy mentioned.  It also means that, largely, we do not have paper around the overall claims process.  Consultants may sign online and there are billing companies that consultants can and do use to do practically everything but the signature.  Unfortunately, the issue is not about making it much easier for the consultants - it may the case with some examples - it is largely about attitude and culture in getting the form signed.  We have done all that.<\/p> <p>  We completely agree with the Deputy on the need for an integrated financial and procurement system.  We are making progress on that.

If one thinks about it, any financial system the HSE is going to have which we also want to use for our bigger funded agencies will have about 10,000 users; therefore, it is a large undertaking.  If one takes three key work streams, in the next year we see ourselves as being able to upgrade significantly what we call our business intelligence reporting tools.  As the Deputy can imagine, there are many old legal systems, from which we are drawing information using what is quite an old reporting tool.  We intend in the next year to upgrade it when we will have greater and quicker access to some of our data.  At the same time, we are making progress in seeking approval around the single large national and financial procurement system.  We will spend the next year, once we get approval, going through the procurement process which is obviously necessary for an investment of this scale.  Projects of this nature need to be approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  If they are large enough, as this one is, one requires what is called a peer review by an appointed panel.  We had the business case meeting with it last week and would say it was quite positive.  We are hopeful of receiving approval in the next while from what is, in effect, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to actually go to tender for the new national system.  We are already working with the Office of Government Procurement on the preliminary stages.  As I said, the tendering process, unfortunately, will take most of a year to complete.<\/p> <p>  At the same time - this is the third piece - we are seeking to do the following.  We have a number of quite old legacy systems, particularly from the five former health boards across the western seaboard, the south and south east.  Our intent in the next couple of years, using our existing frameworks, is to upgrade these systems to make them safe and at least have a single platform.  That will take us about two years to complete, until the end of 2017 or early 2018.  We will then move, subject to necessary approval and the allocation of funding, to a single national financial system.  This will take in the order of five years to complete.  I think the Secretary General mentioned a period of five to eight years.  We hope to be in and out in around five years and will do so in less time, if we can.  What we are trying to demonstrate is that we will see improvements in the next year when we improve the reporting system.  We will see greater safety in stabilising the existing five legal systems along the western seaboard and in the southern part of the country.  At the same time we hope that by the end of next year we will have completed the procurement process and selected the overall platform to be used to enable us to drive on to a single integrated national financial system.  It is a painful process; it has been difficult in the past few years, but our sense now is that we are very well connected with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that there is a governance process stretching to all three.  I am satisfied that we will get approval and move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>May I ask Mr. Mulvany's about his team?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Is it being managed internally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#W00400","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>It is being managed internally, but, obviously, we will be using and have used external support.

There is wastage in hospitals.  We have been addressing this in recent years.  At the national distribution centre we have introduce point-of-use management.  The idea is that procurement people manage at the point of use, not the clinicians.  Clinicians are busy trying to get back to their patients and so on and we have taken that workload away from them.  We have introduced Kanban, a point-of-use management system.  This involves the management of stock at the point of use and it reduces the wastage.  In other words, we introduce materials requirement planning into the ward and there is assessment of the stock required at ward level on an ongoing basis rather than on a weekly or fortnightly basis.  Even if a ward was to reduce or change its function in some way, we can amend the arrangements to bring in the required stock.  This is being received well by clinicians.  We have been able to measure it in Tullamore.  The nurses there gave us the facts.  Between four and six hours per week per ward of clinical time was transferred back to front-line activity, and that is only in respect of the time of clinicians.  The actual reduction of inventory that we have seen ranges between 30% and 45%.  That is where we get our savings from.  This is monitored on a daily basis with clinicians and active management.  We are bringing that forward.<\/p> <p>  We reckon there are approximately 600 locations where point-of-use management can be introduced throughout the HSE.  At this stage, 50% of that target is already completed.  As we roll the national distribution centre operation into full implementation we will be taking care of the other 300 locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#BB02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Swords"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Is there statistical evidence of improvement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#BB02300","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445504400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.  We have the statistical evidence on the reduction of inventory in the first instance.  There is a culture change as well because people are habitual by nature.

We know that 7% is the industrial norm and we are meeting that at a minimum.  This is significant given the stockholding arrangements of any major hospital.<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of obsolete stock, which is where Deputy Dowds may be referencing or going ahead to.

They point to the inconsistencies and discretionary budget allocations across the different HSE regions.  As a result of that, they suffer from a poor consistency in the delivery of services.  In fact, in a border constituency such as Carlow-Kilkenny with its Laois border at Graiguecullen beside Carlow, there are often turf disputes over how services are delivered on the Laois side and on the Carlow side, depending on where one lives.  Deputy Sean Fleming has encountered this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#CC00700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I am an expert on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015102200002#CC00800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1445504400,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Regardless of the efforts that are made through the HSE, the answer is always, \"Yes, you can get that service in the other administrative area [which might be in the Carlow side] but there will be a funding issue\".  That is despite the fact that the funding issue has already been addressed by virtue of the fact that the patient or client is receiving the services within the HSE area but across the border.  These issues appear to be easy to resolve but they have been around for as long as I have been dealing with them.  Will you kindly address that in the context of the letter you received?<\/p> <p>  The other fact the groups point to is the gaps in early assessment and the waiting times of more than one year for vital services such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology.  These are placing children with disabilities at risk of regression and denying them the chance to reach their full potential.  The groups go on to point to the figures they recently obtained from the HSE.  There are 1,940 children waiting in excess of one year for speech and language assessment.  A further 2,983 have already been assessed as requiring the service but they are on the waiting list for at least a year without receiving the treatment.  In addition, 2,090 children are waiting at least 12 months for an OT service, which is essential to assist them in accomplishing everyday tasks such as eating, dressing or writing, and 7,301 people, including children, are waiting for more than one year to receive physiotherapy.  Eleven local health areas remain without an early intervention team.<\/p> <p>  They are drawing attention to this and have asked the Committee of Public Accounts to get from the HSE, in a clear, legible format, the total allocated budget in each of the areas of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology, a breakdown by each of the four HSE areas for children with disabilities for each year from January 2011 up to now and to deal with the actual spend, that is, what the budget was, what was actually spent and a breakdown within the areas.  You should be able to get that for us.<\/p> <p>  They include in their submission a letter from a parent, which explains it quite well.  They talk about the services that are available for children aged 16 to 18.  Amanda is a seven year old girl with Down syndrome.  She has been diagnosed with moderate intellectual disability, moderate visual impairment and she has an ongoing cardiac condition.  She has been under the services of St. Catherine's Association in Wicklow since her birth.  However, she was under the care of the HSE in a pilot programme at the time the letter was written.  At that time there was no speech and language therapy and no occupational therapy being offered.  When she had initial contact with the multi-disciplinary team, it said that there would be one therapy session per term.  The day the parent attended to have that explained to her, without the child, it was considered to be one of the therapy sessions for that year.  The parent has another child of four years of age, typically developed with slight problems of pronunciation and so forth.  As that child was in a different age group she got eight weeks of one-to-one treatment.  However, the child that required it most got none.<\/p> <p>  That case, without highlighting any more of it, spells out the dilemma in which that family and the groups find themselves.  As it involves services, cost of services and so forth, I ask, on their behalf, that the time would be taken by somebody to analyse what is said in the submission, what is being delivered on the ground and to give the figures associated with each and every request in it.  That is not unreasonable.  I could table a string of parliamentary questions but that is not what is required here.

This is compensation which was believed to be due to suppliers in respect of the period from March 2013 to the end of 2014, so it is part of the overall prompt payments legislation.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states, we had taken advice on that which, as far as we are concerned, indicated that we were complying with legislation by not automatically paying that compensation payment to the supplier.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made us aware of the views of the Attorney General.  Obviously, we do not have the Attorney General's advice, nor would it necessarily be appropriate that we would or any questions the Attorney General was asked, but based on the engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General we provided for that &euro;9 million in our accounts.  However, since then we have been reviewing the legal position very carefully.  We have asked our legal service department to go through all the legislation back to the original prompt payments legislation, and all of the EU directive legislation, and that advice confirms to us that we are legally compliant.  The legislation, in our view, confers upon the supplier an entitlement to obtain both the interest and the compensation.  It does not differentiate.  Unlike the earlier prompt payments legislation, this legislation is different.  In reality, we automatically pay the interest.  We do not wait for suppliers to seek it.  We automatically pay it, which may well be beyond the legal requirement, but we do that and do not intent to change doing that.  We accept the principle of seeking to avoid cash liquidity to the small and medium enterprise sector in particular, and the principle of complying with the legislation.<\/p><p>However, our difficulty with our current systems concerns the notion of transferring &euro;9 million effectively to private suppliers who have an entitlement to seek it but who have not sought it.

Again, it concerns payment from hospitals.  It is something I came across and I believe it is unfair, and that is why I am raising it here.  I received correspondence in relation to an issue to do with the payment for a bed and breakfast, which is a service that is widely used by hospitals when consultants visit and need to be kept.  A lady came to me because she was not paid.  The reply from the hospital, St. Luke's, was on 6 May 2015.  The lady issued a letter of response clarifying all the points raised by the hospital in relation to the payment on this account.  I asked a parliamentary question and followed up with letters on 14 July, 20 August and 22 September.  None of those letters has been replied to by the hospital.  What I find mean about it is that not only was the bed and breakfast in question not paid when it raised the question of the outstanding invoice based on the belief that it was properly booked because the person in question was familiar with how it is booked and has worked closely with the HSE, the business went in the direction outlined.  Therefore, the bed and breakfast lady was penalised twice for raising the query.  On top of that, everyone heads to a solicitor.

There is no particular additional cost but one hospital group embarked on something of a rebranding exercise.  Others have not done so and we do not intend that they should, beyond minor adjustments to letterheads as they are renewed in the ordinary course.

The HSE recovered &euro;220 million in 2013 and &euro;172 million in 2014, a reduction in the year of &euro;48 million.  I understand this is primarily related to people from the United Kingdom who are resident here and would be entitled to free medical and hospital care if they were living in the UK.  Under EU rules, they are then entitled to avail of free care if they are living in Ireland.  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this topic and I am on record as having raised this issue previously.  There is an arrangement in place between the Irish and UK authorities, whereby the UK authorities will pay a sum to Ireland based on the number of UK citizens living here.  I understand the figure is net and may be based on a figures of approximately 40,000 people.  According to a reply I received to a parliamentary question, new negotiations were to take place because the calculation used was based an old figure.  I do not believe the negotiations have been finalised.  Both sides probably require help from the Central Statistics Office or other bodies to work out the correct figure and ascertain whether we are receiving what is due to us.  <\/p> <p>  This issue was brought to my attention by a man who visited my office and informed me that, having lived in England, he was entitled to free hospital care here and was not required to pay for outpatient appointments, accommodation, overnight stays or accident and emergency charges.  I wondered how this could be the case.  He informed me that the British Government pays Ireland for this and that hospital care was free of charge for him.  I was surprised to learn that 40,000 people or more are entitled to completely free hospital care in the public service, whereas Irish people must pay for it.  I ask the witnesses to talk us through the figures.  Is it correct that English people in Ireland have free hospital care whereas Irish people must pay charges?

They were proceeding, and many people thought they would be concluded in recent weeks, but that is not happening.

The IPHA is a federation for some of the suppliers.  It comes in and talks to the HSE.  Would the HSE not be better off talking to all the companies on a one-to-one basis because it would strike a better deal?  If there are 20 companies, the HSE can separate them and work one off against the other as opposed to them all coming together as part of the one federation and agreeing not to step on each other's toes and to send in somebody who is not working for any of the companies.  I have said here previously that we are setting prices that the taxpayer will pay without any direct contact with the people from whom we are buying.  I will cite an example I used previously.  It is like the Minister wanting to deal with the banks about an issue and talking to the Irish Bankers' Federation instead of the banks.

The option of putting in place an intermediate distribution system is complicated by the very short shelf life of some of the products and the requirement for a continuous cold chain.  Any time taken to send products to a central point for onward distribution would eat into the shelf life.  Typically, and this is where the \"just in time\" aspect of the matter arises, most patients who are in receipt of high-tech drugs are doing so for a course of treatment, or even sometimes for continuous treatment.  That means there is a capacity to plan.  The variability comes in with the human factor.  I refer to circumstances in which, without the knowledge of the supply system, an individual patient might make a last-minute decision to discontinue with the medication, or may be hospitalised and therefore unavailable to have it in the community, or may make the decision to change pharmacy.

I will start by outlining some of the findings of the report.  One particular finding was that all of the political parties agree that a political vacuum exists in relation to the bill of rights process, but unfortunately there is little or no agreement as to how to progress the bill of rights process.  The two main unionist parties believe it is not their responsibility and that it is the responsibility of others to convince them that a bill of rights is needed for Northern Ireland.  They are open to persuasion, which is positive.  The other parties believe that it is up to them to bring forward the bill of rights process.   Others believe it is not their role to do so and that it is actually the role of the British and the Irish Governments as co-guarantors of the agreement.  In this context our report is important because it contains proposals as to how the British and the Irish Governments could advance the bill of rights process.<\/p> <p>  The report speaks of a policy framework under which the British and Irish Governments could get the parties together to start talking about a bill of rights.  One of the findings of the report is that while there is agreement about a bill of rights, the language used in the interviews illustrated a diversity of understanding around what actually constitutes a bill of rights.  Within the policy framework, there needs to be specific human rights expertise to help the political parties to understand what is meant by a bill of rights and what it does not mean.  It is important that people do not have lofty expectations of what a bill of rights can and cannot deliver.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the British and Irish Governments support and endorse such a process, because there seems to be a divergence of opinion between the Irish and British Governments towards the Good Friday Agreement.  The Irish Government has said that the Good Friday Agreement is the foundational architecture underpinning the entire peace process.  However, the British Government is putting forward proposals to repeal the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British bill of rights, thereby undermining the protection of human rights as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.  Clarification is needed as to how the British Government in particular views the importance of the Good Friday Agreement in the context of the whole peace process in Northern Ireland.  We hope to seek further funding in order to progress our idea that the two Governments can help this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":949,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Smith.

I appeared at the committee previously when I was the Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.  During this process we spent ten hard years - and I genuinely mean ten of the hardest years of my life - drafting the advice on a bill of rights, day and night, weekend after weekend, year after year.  Under my previous chief commissioner, Brice Dickson, and then myself, we undertook a huge number of consultations and went out across the country to civic society, to every sector, to every meeting, to every place that we possibly could have gone across Northern Ireland.  The people of Northern Ireland are extremely politicised in their understanding of this peace agreement.  They know that on page 17 of this agreement there is a proposal - they know it word for word - that the commission draft the advice on a bill of rights and give it to the British Government, which will then legislate.  There was also a proposal for a charter of rights.  The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission have jointly fulfilled their mandates.  When I was chief commissioner we also prepared the charter of rights, which we passed to the Irish Government and to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and there it has sat.  We are not here to talk about the charter today - we are here to talk about the bill of rights - but both of them were part of the agreement.  That agreement went out to the people in 1998 and I remember going into the streets, villages and towns of Northern Ireland on an open-deck bus to convince people to say &quot;Yes&quot; to this agreement, telling them that one of strongest foundations of the agreement was a bill of rights.  We told them that if we had respect for human rights, what had happened would never happen again and there would not be a recurrence of the conflict.  We drafted the advice on the basis of what had gone before, but also on what we would like to see in the future.  As the committee is aware, there are many conflicts taking place in the world.  People talk about transitional justice and the importance of human rights, and the advice was very much based on that.  The advice was then sent to the Secretary of State, and it is good to see that it is included in the 2003 Joint Declaration.  I draw the committee's attention to paragraph 2, annex 3 of the Joint Declaration:<\/p><blockquote>The British Government is committed to bringing forward legislation at Westminster where required to give effect to rights supplementary to the ECHR to reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.<\/blockquote> <p>This 2003 declaration shows a commitment to the introduction of legislation.  Since 2008 nothing has happened and it has been more of a regression.  This has also been acknowledged by the Irish Government.  Under the current Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, the British Government has declared under its election manifesto that it would scrap the Human Rights Act.  Since then there has been a great deal of discussion about the implications for Northern Ireland and for Ireland if the British Government withdrew from the European Convention on Human Rights or from the jurisprudence of the European court.  Even if the UK did withdraw, it would still have to adhere to the fundamental European Charter on Human Rights, which is overseen by the Council of Europe.  There are quite a lot of constitutional issues at stake here.  We drafted the advice when I was with the human rights commission and since returning to academia and to the university.<\/p><p>When Dr. Smith and I undertook the interviews with political parties and with the two Governments, the Irish Government participated and the Northern Ireland Office did not and responded only through correspondence but said it would respond to the final report.  We were concerned that at the end of the process there would continue to be a vacuum.<\/p><p> In the Haass-O&rsquo;Sullivan talks it was picked up and put in a paragraph that it may be taken forward under a committee dealing with culture and identity.  There it has stayed.  We have no idea in any current talks if the bill of rights is still on the agenda, if it has died a death, been buried, parked or if there is a push from either Government to have it resurrected and put back on the agenda. <\/p><p> We proposed that this vacuum needs to be filled.  I recall, in particular when we were dealing with the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, the Patten Commission, taking the parties out of the situation to give them the opportunity to spend some dedicated time dealing with the issue by itself.  They could be introduced to others who had faced a similar situation of drafting bills of rights in conflicted situations or even spend some dedicated time, peacefully and quietly, away from cameras where they could take the advice the commission offered in which some parties think the commission went too far and others might think it did not go far enough, but it was for the political parties to decide.  Commissioners are very proud of that advice on the grounds that civic society in Northern Ireland was 100% behind it and did not fall out over it.  It was over to the parties and the Governments.  We are next.  That is the stage we are at.<\/p><p> We propose two things, one of which is that there be some technical expertise to assist this process because we were shocked when we undertook those interviews at the lack of knowledge on what a bill of rights does and indeed what the Judiciary, the Executive and Parliament do.  It seems that people misunderstood the role of each of those functions but also misunderstood the justiciability of some rights and not of others.  The technical expertise is needed, as it probably was in respect of other issues in the Good Friday agreement but it is not a technical problem.  It is a political one.  We do not know whether the parties and Governments will now dedicate themselves to setting aside that time to deliver on this proposal.<\/p><p> An Irishman has taken over the directorship of the Fundamental Rights Agency in Europe, based in Vienna, who has that expertise.  Is Europe the best place to do this, setting time aside in Vienna or somewhere else?  Should it be in the United States as previously?  Or should it be here in Ireland, North or South, or in Scotland, England or Wales?  We also know that Scotland and Wales are taking a very different stand on the response of the current Prime Minister&rsquo;s reaction to the European Convention and so it is of enormous constitutional value to have those discussions also at the inter-parliamentary level.  There are several places where this can be taken up but it seems to have died a death.  That is of great concern to us and that is what we say in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Monica McWilliams","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":952,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McWilliams for that contribution and for her submission.

If the Chairman reads chapter 2 of our report, he will see that Rev. Ian Paisley and Ian Paisley junior both gave evidence to the Forum for Dialogue and Understanding which sat alongside the multiparty talks.  At that time they were proposing a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  The legacy of the bill of rights goes back to the 1960s, to the Stormont Parliament debates.  In interviews, spokespersons for various parties told us that it was a matter of great regret that a bill of rights was not brought forward in the late 1960s, that we may not have entered the conflict we did if attention had been paid to issues of human rights and equality.  Attention was paid to equality and the Fair Employment Act 1976 was introduced and today in Northern Ireland people say what a good practice example it is for employment and the workplace.  It seems that many of the problems around human rights and embedding a culture of human rights, which is extremely important for our future and for young people, lie outside the workplace.<\/p> <p>  The lack of consensus is a regressive step.  It comes partly from the current Prime Minister, David Cameron.  When he was in opposition, the Labour Government, which had raised the issue of bringing forward a British bill of rights, was moving out, and the Unionist parties had begun to move in the direction of a British bill of rights, with a chapter dealing with Northern Ireland.  That is not what was in the agreement.  We know that would be vetoed in the United Kingdom, UK, perhaps even by Scotland and Wales in terms of its impact on devolution.  It certainly would be vetoed by the Nationalist side in Northern Ireland, in the same way that the Unionists probably exercise a veto in the Northern Ireland Assembly on pushing this forward.<\/p> <p>  The Patten Commission would never have got through the Northern Ireland Assembly had it fallen to the Assembly.  It was very clear that legislation would go through Westminster.  It is very clear this legislation should go through Westminster.  In our report the Chairman will see that in our correspondence with the NIO it keeps referring to the parties in Northern Ireland having to reach consensus.  Following the UK commission, the Secretary of State wrote to each of the parties asking how they would best take forward the proposals of the UK commission.  The UK commission came up with two conclusions: first, it was divided on a British bill of rights; and, second, that the Northern Ireland provision for a bill of rights stands by itself and its process should not be allowed to interfere with the Northern Ireland process.  The Secretary of State wrote to all the parties and did not receive one response from any party.  That may be because the parties had decided at that stage to take a different direction or they did not wish to respond to the Secretary of State.  In our report we say that as long as it is left to the Secretary of State to constantly put the pressure back onto the Northern Ireland parties it will go nowhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Monica McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":954,"content":"<p>What is it about the bill of rights that some of the Northern Ireland parties are so against?

No longer in Northern Ireland do we talk about majority and minority.  Those days are over.  We talk about reaching consensus, coexistence and inclusion but all of that is aspirational.  This would create a foundation.  We hit the nail on the head when we said the legacy of what people see in human rights is what creates a great deal of antagonism between the communities.  The Unionist community predominantly looked to the civil rights movement and saw its progress as a stick over the head with which it was beaten saying it did not do enough.<\/p><p>The civil rights movement brought attention to those issues.  The Unionists in turn would say, \"Well, we have taken care of housing, voting and employment, which were the three key issues of the civil rights movements.  Therefore we no longer need a human rights bill\".  They would also say that the Human Rights Act takes care of all that.  One would now ask who will take care of those rights if that Act is to be removed.<\/p><p> Any additional rights from the Unionist community's perspective are probably to do with the right to process and some issues around property and ethnic cleansing and so on, which they felt had occurred during the Troubles.  From the Nationalist side it is a great deal more.  The Alliance Party, although in favour of social and economic rights, argues that it does not want them to be a dominant influence on the bill of rights, whereas Nationalists do see social and economic rights as being part of a modern-day bill of rights as the rights are interdependent.  If we are going to have the right to vote, we need a right to accommodation and an address in order to vote.  In other bills of rights this is the case but we make those rights progressively realisable depending on resources so there are limitations on them.  That was also the case in South Africa as it is in Canada.<\/p><p> There was a misunderstanding that those rights would also become legal rights and that judges would be taking up the decisions of government.  That is never the case for a bill of rights.  Members ask why there is so little consensus both sides.  Indeed, other people like ethnic minorities almost feel they were left out of this discussion, yet they see something and should see something in a future bill of rights.  At the end of the day no government - not the Irish Government, the British Government or any other government - ever welcomes a bill of rights because it is about holding the government accountable.  This proposal for a bill of rights came out of a peace agreement.  It was asked that in the future, governments would be held accountable for their actions and that people could trust their government to be accountable irrespective of what shades of opinion made up its composition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Monica McWilliams","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":958,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McWilliams.

It is a very important subject which sadly has regressed since 1998 instead of going forward.  Professor McWilliams mentioned that the bill of rights has come out of a peace agreement.  That is an international agreement as well.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron's language when he talks about scrapping the Human Rights Act shows real right-wing Tory disrespect for an international agreement which his Government had entered into.  People should not be open to persuasion on this.<\/p> <p>  Professor McWilliams mentioned that she campaigned in favour of the Good Friday Agreement when other political parties in Northern Ireland did not.  It was endorsed by more than 70% of the electorate in Northern Ireland and by 94.3% of the electorate in the South.  The bill of rights is an integral part of that agreement.  The people have given a mandate to the governments and to the Executive in the North to implement it and it is most disappointing that it has not been done.<\/p> <p>  The 1998 Human Rights Act was the vehicle whereby the British Government satisfied its commitment under the agreement for complete incorporation into Northern Ireland of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Any scrapping or diminution in those provisions amounts in effect to the British Government walking away from an international agreement that it has made.  As we know, this agreement has been lodged with the United Nations.  As it is an international agreement, governments do not have the option of removing parts of it as they see fit or not implementing parts of it.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, the lack of movement on the bill of rights has not generated the awareness among the electorate at large that it should.  The importance of a bill of rights in persuading people to support the Good Friday Agreement proposals in April and May of 1998, which Professor McWilliams mentioned, is of significance.  She mentioned the input of civil society.  It beggars belief that the civic forum has not been reestablished in Northern Ireland.  That is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and the parties the North.  I do not see how a civic forum could threaten anybody.  It does not threaten society, or any particular political tradition or ideology either.  Perhaps the civic forum could as part of its work give some impetus to the governments, political parties and the Executive to put in place the bill of rights?  It is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement which the governments should not be allowed to walk away from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#F00300","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":960,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I have known Professor McWilliams for a long time and am very aware of the work she has done on human rights in the North and her work as human rights commissioner.  As for many aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments have abdicated responsibility for the implementation of the bill of rights.<\/p> <p>  I have sat in the Assembly for past eight years.  Talking to Unionists, they would almost see the whole equality issue as a threat to undermine their position.  We could talk about civil rights and the three planks.  Taking housing as an example, I sat on the social development committee and the housing situation in the North now is probably worse than it was in 1969.  We have two, three and sometimes four generations living in the same house and social housing has not been provided.  There are many issues which have not been provided for.<\/p> <p>  With the British Government intent on withdrawing from the Convention on Human Rights and setting up its own provisions, the implementation of a bill of rights in the North would strengthen the position of all sides and would not threaten to undermine Unionists' Britishness, for example.  It would actually strengthen those aspects.  Certainly there is a lack of responsibility.  I am involved with Sinn F&eacute;in in terms of outreach to other parties and civic society whether it be the churches, the unions or whatever.  There is a willingness but it is a question of reaching the point at which people have to sit down away from the glare and the spotlight and actually discuss these issues.  We cannot get a definition of what a victim is and it is very difficult to get a definition of what a bill of human rights would actually entail.  I think that is at the crux of the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":961,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  Their presentation addressed the foundational architecture or pillars for an inclusive society, which is key to the Good Friday Agreement.  There are probably people watching this meeting in their own homes at the moment as it is being broadcast live.  A lot of people will be scratching their heads and asking why would anyone be opposed to a bill of rights.  Professor McWilliams outlined why governments would be opposed as it calls them to account.  The difficulty seems to be that some people do not feel there is a need for one.  I presume those people are not impacted by rights issues as a group.  I think that is part of the difficulty.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses' paper stated that the two main Unionist parties believe it is the responsibility of others to convince them there is a need for a bill of rights.  The same two parties probably had a view in the past that majoritarianism was okay, that a one-party state was okay, that a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people was okay and that gerrymandering was okay.  Some might say that could have been wrong at the time.  They might say discrimination did not really happen that much in jobs, housing and so on.  While some people look at the past and say it was not really that bad, there are other sections of society which feel that they were left out.  The Good Friday Agreement was about creating a fair and inclusive society and this is one of the pillars that was to hold it all up.  We are left with this.<\/p><p>We put it to a vote and a majority of people on both parts of the island voted overwhelmingly in favour of it but nothing happened.  People were scratching their heads and said they thought they agreed to this.  It was part of the new way forward but the two Governments sat back and left it to the parties to decide.<\/p><p> There is common agreement across the broad spectrum of politics in Ireland that this is not going to happen and we will leave it to the new party.  The difficulty is where we go from here.  Clearly, only the two Governments will move it forward.  One Government has broken off because it has said legislation introduced by the European Parliament is undermining British sovereignty and, therefore, it will go ahead and do its own thing.  The crux of the matter is how we move forward from here.  If we are serious about it and believe it is needed, and I think it is, how can we move it forward?  It should be taken out of the responsibility of the parties because they cannot or will not agree.  Responsibility for it has to be put back in the hands of the two Governments.  One Government is pulling away from the process, while the other has made statements and so on but is not pushing ahead, even though there is supposed to be equivalence within the process.<\/p><p> One reason Unionists give for not agreeing to a bill of rights is that it would include people they do not believe should have full rights, such as gay and lesbian people.  They will say there is no way they will sign up to such legislation.  In a way, they are cherry-picking who should have rights and who should not, and that is part of the difficulty.  That is why I am saying the process should no longer be the responsibility of those parties.  If they cannot agree, we should be pushing forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#F00500","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":963,"content":"<p>To clarify, the Irish Government completely supports all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including the bill of rights.

These are difficult issues to resolve after a long conflict.<\/p> <p>  If there is a withdrawal from the Human Rights Act and the Convention on Human Rights, that will also have an impact on policing.  The Patten report and the legislation contain various clauses that oblige the police to adhere to position regarding the convention rights.  Likewise, the Northern Ireland Assembly has a legislative responsibility to be compliant with the convention rights.<\/p> <p>  I will address the questions in turn.  Trying to get consensus on human rights is probably not the best way to go because one could end up with the lowest common denominator.  Some expertise and understanding about what these rights do for everyone is needed.  I have concerns when people constantly look for political consensus on issues of such importance.  However, it was put to me the other day that the Second World War - a shocking conflict - ended in 1945, that countries went about reconstruction and that the European Convention on Human Rights was introduced in 1950.  The Conservative Government had a major hand in the latter but, by 1962, Europe was a different place and countries were co-operating and agreeing that there would be no recurrence of the human rights violations which have occurred on all sides in Northern Ireland.  It has now been 17 years since the introduction of the Good Friday Agreement.  Could we say the same?  Could we say that we are in a completely different place, have an understanding of what of what we did to each other and an understanding of what human rights can do to prevent that from happening again?<\/p> <p>  On the first question in respect of a civic forum, I was one of the people who wrote the words regarding such a forum into the peace agreement.  The proposal came from me and other colleagues in the Women's Coalition at that time because we wanted civic society to play a role in the future alongside the legislative Assembly.  We also thought of it as a new way of bringing new people into politics and a very sensible place where people could spend some time on cultural, economic and social affairs, which is what the civic forum was to do.  It is a great disappointment to me that it was abolished when the first Assembly collapsed in 2003.  It should stay in place when there is a vacuum in the Northern Ireland Assembly.<\/p> <p>  I do not think it is the place for the bill of rights.

The Deputy is quite correct.  Many people would ask, &quot;What bill of rights?  What was that?  Where is it?&quot;, particularly in light of all their engagement only for the process to have gone nowhere.  A number of organisations in Northern Ireland are still working on it.  These include the Human Rights Consortium, the Committee on the Administration of Justice and a number of others.  By the way, their funding is running out because Atlantic Philanthropies is winding down its spending.  They are facing a crisis.  I mention this because as organisations become part of civic society, they have been left to do a lot of the heavy lifting but they do not have the necessary resources.  A Northern Ireland human rights fund was established to enable them to do so.

We do not have any such examples in Northern Ireland at present.<\/p> <p>  What came out of that forum was that perhaps it did not stay together long enough to reach an agreement on certain rights but that a couple of options on how to move the process forward did emerge.  We lifted them into the Human Rights Commission and did our best with them.  We are not saying that civic society should be left out of the discussion because it has a lot to add in Northern Ireland in terms of peace building, human rights and transitional justice.  All I am saying is that we would like to hear from the political parties and Government on this issue.  That is the current situation, which brings me to my response to the second question.<\/p><p>I would simply ask whether Sinn F&eacute;in or any other party put the issue of the introduction of a bill of rights down for discussion at any of the recent rounds of talks and, if so, what priority it was given.  In the course of our interviews for the report, we put this question to a number of people in both Governments and in the United States and the answer was that the issue is no longer really a priority for any of the parties and does not receive the priority it once did.<\/p><p> Deputy Crowe raised the issue of a potential undermining of sovereignty.  If one listens to what the Judiciary in the United Kingdom is saying - in the Supreme Court and in the High Courts of Northern Ireland and other courts in the North - one will hear that this has never been the case.  The UK has only ever lost 2% of all its cases at the Strasbourg court.  Moreover, a new protocol is being introduced which Ireland, too, will probably have to sign up to.  Protocol 15 allows for a large margin of appreciation for domestic jurisdictions in terms of how they apply the European Convention on Human Rights in the context of the principle of subsidiarity.  That is about to be introduced and is something the Prime Minister will take into account for the future.<\/p><p> Members may be aware that Baroness Hale has argued it would be a huge step backwards if the convention rights were to be scrapped.  It seems clear there is no issue of sovereignty.  The person with perhaps the greatest expertise on this subject is Dominic Grieve, the Conservative Party's former Attorney General, who makes a plea for everybody to stop talking about sovereignty.  If anything, he has said, sovereignty needs human rights.  If there is a view that parliament should be able to do whatever it likes, he argues, then that is not what sovereignty was ever about.  Mr. Grieve has written extensively on the issue in recent months and it is important he should so as a former Attorney General appointed by the Conservative Government.

People, irrespective of where they live, need access to human rights and they need a bill of rights.  That is all the more important in a post-conflict situation.  It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to developing a peace process and creating public confidence in that process.  A bill of rights is central to those efforts.<\/p> <p>  It is clear from the witnesses' presentations that the public has bought into the concept of a bill of rights, is aware of it and supportive of it.

David Cameron's position on breaking the link between European human rights and a distinctive body of British human rights has created a lot of alarm, certainly within Nationalist communities and in this jurisdiction.  It comes back to several issues, one of which is the Good Friday Agreement and the international obligations associated with the implementation of that Agreement.  This committee is an implementation body but we cannot get one section of the community in the Six Counties to sit here with us to discuss issues.  That in itself creates difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to civic society and how it can contribute to peace-building.  I am very supportive of the delegates' views in this regard.  They observed that it takes a political process to lift and move things forward, and the lack of that political support is inhibiting what they are seeking to do.  The question, then, is how we move beyond where we are at now and create the political support that is required.  The witnesses noted that it might require outside intervention in order to guide people in that direction and so forth.  We need a situation where the process is driven publicly and the political people, or people of influence within society, are forced to push it forward.  There is an obligation in this regard on the leadership within communities and within civic society, as well as on political and religious leaders.  In that context, will the delegates indicate what support they have had from the religious institutions for pushing this forward?  Has the contribution from those bodies, if any, been positive or negative?  In the case of influential people within civic society, are there sectarian divisions evident in terms of the support or otherwise for making progress?  Finally, is there a legal avenue under the international obligations within the Good Friday Agreement whereby a political party could take a leading role in having a bill of rights implemented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#H00700","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":984,"content":"<p>The delegates stated they are seeking more funding to produce a policy framework to progress a bill of rights.  From whom do they intend to seek that funding and what exactly do they envisage in terms of how such funding would be used?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of technical expertise, I absolutely agree with the points made.  There is a view that politicians should come from the Law Library or from county families.

On the churches, we went to all the faith communities, not just the Christian churches, asking for their views, although not on this particular report because this report was entirely focused on the responses from political parties, and those of the governments.  We had interviewed civic society and the sectors previously, and the churches have a very large role to play in that regard.  There was a bit of a bad taste left after the forum on the bill of rights ended its work in that the Catholic Church had raised a concern that the right to determination might be contained in the advice, and it withdrew its support.  Following consultations with the Catholic Church and other denominations it came back to the issue of what a bill of rights can and cannot do, and that is not one of the issues it will resolve.  In the end, the Human Rights Commission got the support of the churches for the rights it was putting forward, particularly in terms of the rights for children that were included.  It is a social justice issue so why would they not be supportive, although on certain issues such as women's rights, reproductive rights or issues to do with children, the members have seen the reaction that can come when those rights surface?  The advice offered in 2008 went forward as having the support of all the sectors.  I remember participating in all of those meetings and reassuring the faith communities that they needed to see themselves as being able to take this forward in any discussions with the political parties.<\/p> <p>  The polls that have been undertaken, and they were numerous polls in Northern Ireland on this issue, were quite expensive to undertake.  The human rights consortium undertook a number, but some independent bodies did also.  The surprising outcome of those polls was that there was no sectarian division.  It should be noted that there is a class distinction in the support for a bill of rights; the members might expect that.  The loyalist working class communities, and their party political spokespersons, have not always been supportive of a bill of rights.  However, the Progressive Unionist Party, PUP, whose members we interviewed, continue to support a bill of rights.  From that perspective, therefore, they are different from the two other Unionist parties in that the PUP fully support a bill of rights, did so at that time, and has continued to do so on the grounds that those rights could be identified by working class people and their communities, particularly with regard to the future.  The polls have not shown any sectarian division, which was heartwarming from our point of view.  That is useful to know.<\/p> <p>  There is a conundrum in that one would think the parties would reflect their constituencies on this issue yet there seems to be a bit of a divide in the Unionist community between what the people in the communities, and the parties, are saying.  Dr. Smith can take up the point on our future funding because we did not want to leave this report as a research report sitting on the shelf.  We made it a proposal to the Governments but we said also that, if possible, we would seek additional funding to facilitate a further process with the parties on the basis of our findings, if they so wish.  We are prepared to do that, and the Rowntree foundation will be the body we would go back to on that.<\/p> <p>  The question is whether the parties are ready for that and interested in continuing to have a discussion around the proposal that was in both the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  Would everyone come to the table?  There is not much point in having a certain side at the table; the process must be inclusive.  The circumstances must be created for that and it should be given a priority that it has not received to date.  The question is whether we will be asking our grandchildren what happened to the bill of rights rather than taking the opportunity, now that we have it.<\/p> <p>  I believe the Northern Ireland community could do with some confidence building regarding these discussions.  We expect too many of our teachers in schools to produce new tools on human rights for the next generation that would be different in terms of understanding the meaning of human rights when it is not on the table in the current political process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Monica McWilliams"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":987,"content":"<p>To follow on from what Professor McWilliams said, we have approached the Joseph Rowntree Foundation as a potential funding body but we still have to go through the same process we went through for this project.

We must avoid using \"legalese\", as it is referred to.

It is very much appreciated by everybody here and within the communities in which we work in Northern Ireland.  It is useful that we are making a presentation after the previous presentation on the Good Friday Agreement and associated outstanding issues.  It was very interesting and convincing.  We are going to touch on some of the same issues, including the role of civil society, in our presentation.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has introduced everybody present so I will not do so again.  Ms Mary Montague will do most of the talking as part of our introduction.  The Community Relations Council has been celebrating its 25th year this year.  Over its 25 years, it has been an arm's length body of government and acting independently of government to try to develop peace building and reconciliation in Northern Ireland through funding, policy, innovation and supporting good practice.  In 2014, it became obvious to the Community Relations Council and everybody else to whom we were talking that there was significant frustration within civil society and among the practitioners with whom the council works over the current state of peace-building efforts and the peace process.  That frustration manifested itself in practitioners getting together with the Community Relations Council to start a process they called \"Galvanising the Peace\".  The council has been helping to facilitate that process which has been driven and led by the practitioners and civil society.  The delegates present are some of the people who have been driving the process as part of a working group.  It is a process that has involved many more people and, as Ms Montague will outline, it involves increasing numbers.  It is a substantial initiative and one that I believe will make a significant contribution to our understanding of peace and how it can be galvanised in the coming months and years.<\/p> <p>  I thank the members.  I will hand over to the practitioners who have been leading this initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Osborne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>On behalf of Tide Training and the whole delegation, I thank the committee members for taking the time to listen to us.  Building the peace is not just a laudable aim; it is one of the most complex and toughest to achieve.  Practitioners feel there needs to be systemic and structural change tackling the causes of division and the reasons sectarian and divisive attitudes continue to prevail.  Beyond that, relationship-building work is critical to the building of trust, which is a key component of a shared and reconciled society.<\/p> <p>  We need a vision that takes the best of what we all represent to create something special that has not yet been possible on this part of the island or as part of the United Kingdom.  That is why a large number of practitioners in the field of reconciliation, such as ourselves, have produced the document called Galvanising the Peace.  The process has been facilitated by the Community Relations Council but is driven by us, the practitioners.  We hope that after extensive discussion with civil society over the coming months, a thousand or more voices will identify a way forward for developing the peace process that highlights the critical issues and outlines the key needs.<\/p> <p>  The Northern Ireland peace process has comprised a series of initiatives designed to bring about an end to armed conflict, create the basis for a new inclusive political settlement and support reconciliation.  It includes the implementation of the 1998 Agreement in addition to peace-building work on the ground.<\/p> <p>  The Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act provide an institutional architecture and underpinning structure for a society based on equality, human rights and good relations.  Some progress has been made in dismantling the physical infrastructure of conflict but there is much work still needed to dismantle the attitudes that gave rise to the conflict and that sustain racism and sectarianism.  Much of the goodwill displayed at the signing of the Agreement has evaporated.  Sectarian and racist tensions and cultural conflicts have exacerbated this.  Intolerance and hatred remain in many forms.  Destructive political and community relationships can lead to violence.  Anti-peace factions feed off this and have the potential to undermine progress.  This position is unsustainable and causes a great deal of concern among us. <\/p> <p>  The peace process itself needs to be reignited and recalibrated.  We need to build, not dismantle, the reconciliation infrastructure.  We must utilise the commitment, courage and skills that people here have demonstrated for generations to move on to the next phase of the peace process.<\/p> <p>  The Agreement affirms a number of human rights, one being the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnic background.  To enable this aspiration to be a reality, an agreed strategy for our future aspirations is critical to address racism, sectarianism and segregation, encourage regeneration, challenge poverty and promote a shared society.  Austerity measures are contrary to the creation of a vibrant and strong community.  For this, people need to have access to good health care and have their educational needs met and opportunities for work.  Strengthening the peace is essential for economic progress and creating jobs in areas that have experienced the most negative impact of the conflict enables a sustainable peace.<\/p> <p>  The changes happening as a result of the peace process have created a perception of loss and imbalance for some and a feeling that the process has not been of benefit to all.  This perception must be addressed and it must be acknowledged that it is deeply felt across all working class communities.  The Executive needs to give clear leadership and outline a path to a peaceful future based on equality, human rights and respect for diversity rather than a path to a society marked by sectarianism and intolerance and eroded by poverty.<\/p> <p>  The Agreement states, in respect of the past, that the achievement of a peaceful and just society would be a true memorial to the victims of violence.  Practitioners feel the issues of the past must not be confined to those who lived through it.  Our legacy is inter-generational and will have a profound impact as we move forward.<\/p><p>There is an urgent need to find a meaningful commitment and mechanisms to deal with the past and trans-generational trauma as victims and survivors are within every part of our society, regardless of age, community background or profession.  It continues in the youth.  The participants recognise that young people from areas affected by the Troubles face particular difficulties and will support the development of special community-based initiatives based on international best practice.  There are many examples of good practice in youth work.  However, we, as practitioners, believe this work is undermined in areas where there is still a paramilitary presence.  Paramilitaries still act as gatekeepers in some communities and such behaviour drives out investment, hitting the poorest hardest, with an adverse effect on the youth of the area.<br\/><br\/>On policing, the Agreement states it should be responsive to the community's concerns and encourage community involvement, where appropriate.  It is very difficult for those who live in fear and feel they cannot raise their head above the parapet as it rebounds not only on themselves but also on their families.  The role of civil society and its confidence in policing are important.  While providing resources to respond to community concerns is effective, it is also essential.<br\/><br\/>The Agreement goes on to state policing should be designed to ensure policing arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos and symbols, are such that in Northern Ireland there is a police service that can enjoy widespread support from and is seen as an integral part of the community as a whole.<br\/><br\/>Police reform measures are under immense pressure as the PSNI strives to manage the legacy of the past while delivering policing services with less money.  An example of this is the withdrawal of training in community relations and community policing as part of the reduction of training for new recruits from 40 to 20 weeks, but it is not just in policing.  The justice system is feeding into one of the legacy issues.  The community wants a quick response to anti-social behaviour.  Therefore, communities are still looking for quick, effective local responses rather than the more formal and legal routes.  It appears to the community that the system treats offenders better than victims and that harmers do not face the full consequences of their actions.<br\/><br\/>As regards our work as practitioners, it is stated in the Agreement that the participants recognise and value the work being done by many organisations to develop reconciliation, mutual understanding, respect between and within communities and traditions.  They see such work as playing a vital role in consolidating peace and political agreement.  Accordingly, they pledge their continuing support to such organisations and will positively examine the case for enhanced financial assistance for the work of reconciliation.  We continue our efforts to grow peace, trust and reconciliation.  Our commitment remains strong, but we are under severe strain.  Intolerance and hatred are common and developing better relationships where they are difficult or non-existent between communities and people is critical.  A participative framework involving civil society to build peace, support and good government is vital.  To achieve this, as practitioners, we require a systemic approach with cross-departmental working, shared strategic and operational plans implemented through respectful partnerships between statutory, community, business and all other sectors.  This will require investment and resources.<br\/><br\/>The galvanising peace process we are facilitating will, no doubt, engage civil society's participation in government and policy development, in ensuring people are not left behind by the political system or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  In strengthening trust in the institutions, it may highlight a need for the final dismantling of paramilitarism and the reclaiming of communities by communities.  It may suggest structural and systemic reform around education and housing.  It will no doubt address the need for relational change amidst a concern that an erosion of the reconciliation infrastructure is taking place which could have significant detrimental consequences in the years to come.  For practitioners like us in the field, it feels like this is a crossing point in the peace process.  It is a time that will be judged by history.  Was there a serious intent on the part of everyone to make the peace process work or was it a missed opportunity?  All of us can make a contribution, whether large or small.  What we do now will have a long-term impact on us, our children and our children's children.  Many of us came into this work because of our children.  We need to reflect carefully and find the courage to seize rather than miss the opportunity.  <br\/><br\/>We are happy to take questions and actually have a chairperson.  As peace practitioners, we need to be kept in order; therefore, Mr. O'Donnell will chair part of the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Montague","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Montague and hope Mr. O'Donnell will have more say than I sometimes have in this committee.

I appreciate and I am aware of the work her organisation has done for many years.  One of her comments was very telling, that the legacy affects everyone, including children.  I am lucky in the sense that I come from Newry where we never had the sectarian issues other areas such as Portadown and Lurgan had.  Sometimes it is difficult to understand.  I am not saying we did not have issues, but they were few and far between, certainly on a personal level growing up in a mixed community but which was predominantly Nationalist.  We played football and other sports and had friends in the Unionist and Protestant community.  I have to say it was never a problem, coming from a mixed background and having Protestant grandparents on both sides of the family.  As my father was from Markethill and I came from a very mixed community, perhaps that helped.<\/p> <p>  One of the difficulties in terms of what happens in the North concerns the media.  I was talking to Mr. Osborne and Mr. McCallum about this beforehand.  I sat on committees at Stormont for eight years and there is a lot of constructive work being done there and a lot of consensus that is never portrayed.  If I meet an objective journalist, it will probably be for the first time, in the North certainly and I have to say it does not seem to be much better in the South.  There is work being done which really is not appreciated.  One only has to listen to know this.  We have five hours of comment, starting at 6.30 a.m., apart from some music between 10.30 a.m. and noon.  We have comment in which the Assembly and the peace process are constantly criticised.  We need to have a broader discussion with people, including the members of this committee who are on the ground.  <\/p> <p>  As someone with a background in dealing with welfare rights, I was struck by the welfare cuts.  In speaking to loyalist communities in east Belfast, for instance, on the Newtownards Road and in the Woodburn Church, it was clear that they had exactly the same problems as those encountered in my community.  The difficulty is that in talking to people who are, to use Ms Montague's own word, galvanising to mobilise against the cuts, the flag protest took over and became a bigger issue.<\/p><p>I was listening to the radio this morning before this meeting.  Again, the issues raised were what people term the bread-and-butter issues.  Average disposable income per household in the North is almost &pound;100 less than it is in Britain, yet these cuts will be imposed and will affect everybody.  It will make the committee&rsquo;s and our work that much harder because we are not dealing with practicalities but with ideology that is being forced upon people.<br\/><br\/>Generationally, sectarian issues are being broken down.  The father of one of my son&rsquo;s best friends is a Free Presbyterian minister.  His son spends a lot of time in our house and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It has not become an issue.  They would never discuss religion or politics.  Maybe there is some light at the end of the tunnel and we are getting away from the sectarian and racism issues that we come across almost daily.  The work of the committee is bringing forward reality and is based on common sense.  It is about people accepting that we need to move forward and not to be constantly looking over our shoulders.  That is an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegations to the committee and thank them for their excellent presentations.  They highlighted the work that still needs to be done.  I detect from this and previous contributions that there is a sense of a lack of confidence in the process.  There is a sense that the peace process has been neglected politically, maybe at governmental level.  I spoke to Ms Mary Montague at one of her organisation&rsquo;s events about how many young people in the North do not vote and there was a cross-community aspect to it.  There is a sense of disillusionment.  We have much of that here where many young people do not vote.  It could be because the political system is not reflective of the aims and aspirations of young people, either from a vision or from a practical point of view.<\/p> <p>  The point was made that the peace process needs to be revitalised.  Will the delegations suggest how this could be done and the role the committee could have in driving that forward?  It was stated that while there was a kind of utopian support for the peace process, in the most affected areas during the conflict one still has anti-peace process factions, such as paramilitary groups, working to try to destabilise it for their own ends which is not in the interest of their communities.  What is the level of support for anti-peace process-dissident republicans, or whatever they like to call themselves, and those in loyalist communities?  Is it secured through intimidation and fear in those communities?  The one thing that comes across to those of us involved politically is the role of a hidden hand regarding what is being done in those areas in the so-called name of an ideology.<\/p> <p>  We have met with people from loyalist working-class communities, ex-combatants, former paramilitaries and so forth.  One of those, Jackie McDonald, said that Sinn F&eacute;in has MEPs, councillors, TDs and MLAs but the loyalist working-class communities do not have representation.  They are being represented by people who might espouse an entirely different economic ideology to what is suitable for their own communities.  What is needed in working-class loyalist communities is working-class loyalist representation.  This is necessary to bring about a situation where one can build a working-class rights movement.  During the Troubles, most of the conflict took place in working-class areas.  Those people were also the victims in the lead-up to the Troubles and they still are the victims, in terms of the proposed welfare cuts and so forth that are coming down the track.  <\/p> <p>  We recently met a group of young people associated with one of the main loyalist groupings in working-class areas.  They were talking about flags.  I said to them there is an issue that affects republican and Nationalist working-class areas and loyalist working-class areas, namely, the proposed welfare cuts and how they will affect all of them.  I said to them they should unite around this common issue that will affect all of them across the divide.  Doing something like that can help build bridges and develop a struggle around rights and entitlements.<\/p> <p>  The lack of investment and resources going into those areas was also referred to.  The consequence of that is the loss of jobs and significant unemployment and so forth.  This has to be addressed by the Exchequer, or whoever is providing funding, and proactively pushed forward.  Education is another aspect of this.  Since I have been on this committee, I have been advocating very strongly for integrated education right across the communities.  Most of what we are is what we learned.  There is no difference between a black child and a white child, a Protestant and Catholic, or whatever.  That has to be part of how one helps to erode the sectarianism that exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#N00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>What we have tried to do is create a process of convenience.  While we all come from the community sector, we all work in different fields.  It may be just easier to explain it that way.

We will bring it around the community sector initially but it will be across wider civic society in the end.  The intention is we will bring it to a conference in December.<\/p><p>Hopefully, we will have it endorsed in time for the elections and parties might agree to support it in the forthcoming elections next year.

We realise that in terms of legislation, politicians need to bring those measures forward but we hope they would look upon the community sector in general and perhaps ourselves in particular as those prepared to labour to bring forward those endeavours.  Part of the document was born out of a sense of frustration with \"in-out\" politics, such as the crisis management that we continually lurch towards or the fact that we are always held hostage by the negative media sensation.  This is the new crash.  I do not now think it is any surprise to the committee or others to find that we probably totally endorse all of the things that were said earlier in terms of the bill of rights, perhaps not in the articulate manner set out by Professor McWilliams but certainly in terms of what that means, the expectations people have about it and the engagement civic society would like to have.  <\/p><p> To move on to what Deputy Ferris asked about, perhaps Mr. Poole and then Ms Jones will address those two issues and maybe pick up the part relating to young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>In respect of the paramilitary issue, which is the easiest one, it is worth starting by saying that we came to the Good Friday Agreement as a deeply hurt community.  It was a profoundly hurt community that was traumatised through all the layers of society.  You had to have lived through it to understand the coping mechanisms that were developed even by people who were not necessarily living in areas in which the violence was acute.  Nevertheless, the kind of psycho-social adjustments one had to make to accommodate the abnormality of that protracted internecine war were such that we eventually learned to live with abnormality and live with it to such a degree that we did not know what normal was.  The choreography of that still exists not just in our psyche but in our very body language and movements.  A recent study showed that when a generation of young schoolchildren who were not even born when the Good Friday Agreement was signed were coming home from school, they still walked ten minutes via a longer route they no longer needed to walk.  The choreography of sectarian division written on the very landscape of coming home and going to school was still part of the unconscious narrative of how people lived.<\/p> <p>  We cannot think of the issue of paramilitarism without understanding that the context of the peace process involved tens of thousands of men and women who belonged to paramilitary organisations and who throughout the protracted conflict saw their identity, sense of supporting the cause, ideology or pro-British or pro-Irish positions defined by the kind of structures the paramilitary formations provided.  To a large degree, we came into the peace process with no idea about how all of that would be addressed.  Of the three things that were essential for the peace process, the first was the end of hostilities.  That is always the beginning of something.  The other was an overarching political canopy whereby people felt their voice was represented at political and Government level.  The third was what to do in the community with the hate, hurt, trauma, fallout, victimhood, the consequences of all of that violence and the threats and fears that became normative.  We have been working with that at community level for decades and to a large degree and for various reasons, Government has not been able to address that or not necessarily able to meet us halfway in that healing process - not least in terms of funding and support.  It is doing its best but to a large degree, it is working with the big overarching political dimensions of parking the constitutional question and stabilising the politics.  The community sector has been working in that vacuum and looking at the issues of hate, hurt, reconciliation, healing and even concepts of forgiveness and truth telling - all those things that are not cerebral but that have a relational and emotional dimension.  The paramilitary issue is one of those themes.  <\/p> <p>  I know this is representative of the entire panel.  Everyone of us around this table believes the culture and infrastructure of paramilitarism is no longer justifiable in any shape or form and that unaccountable authority is unacceptable in the kind of democracy we want to build.  We certainly believe that any organisations that get their way through any form of emotional or physical threat are unacceptable to our society.  We want to be nuanced about this by saying that paramilitaries did not arrive in our context like aliens on a spaceship.  They are our community and are embedded in the reality of our streets, families, institutions and structures.  Paramilitaries are not something that is not us.  They are our brothers and fathers.  They were predominantly men but they are our sisters.  They are our neighbours.  They are people who defended us or threatened us, depending on your ideology.  I was put out of my home at gunpoint by the IRA one night and moved across town into a house from which a Catholic family had been put out at gunpoint by the UVF.  In that internecine experience of paramilitarism, ironically, we found ourselves living the very same experience of fear, threat and vulnerability.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of paramilitarism must be addressed as an embedded community, not a set of aliens.  It must also be nuanced about, to put it in the vernacular, good gatekeepers and bad gatekeepers.  Paramilitarism is not one thing.  It is a very complex phenomenon and legacy of the conflict that must be addressed with creativity and imagination.  Of course, it has become a weapon or tool for demonising people in one way both at political level and at community level.  The issue of demobilisation and the more complex issue of \"civilianising\" the psyche need subtle, sensitive, careful and generous engagement, particularly with community practitioners who are the ones who often work with paramilitary institutions and organisations.  The issue is one of not demonising those who find themselves involved in paramilitarism for all kinds of complicated reasons and yet paradoxically, against that is the issue of accountability, justice, victimhood and truth telling.  All of those things are being juggled at the moment as we address the phenomenon of paramilitarism.  <\/p> <p>  In particular, I want to say something about the gatekeepers.  They are people with a paramilitary background who have the reputation of controlling an area.  They are gangsters.  There is no doubt about that.  The issue of how the PSNI with its limited reserves addresses that and how the community stops looking to those structures to police the area and to deal with antisocial behaviour is complex.  However, there are also gatekeepers from paramilitary backgrounds who have been doing community work, albeit sometimes through a paramilitary structure, that is a genuine attempt to do good in that community, to put things right and to address the legacy of the past.<\/p><p>I would also like to say something about loyalist paramilitaries because, to a large degree, loyalist paramilitarism has manifested itself in a particularly unique way, in a way that has shown all kinds of paranoia, insecurity and vulnerability about the political changes that have gone on.  Loyalist paramilitarism, and loyalism as a phenomenon in general, has been badly served and profoundly misrepresented and misunderstood.  As early as 1974, loyalist paramilitaries in the Maze Prison and through the PUP were writing a Good Friday agreement and maybe even a better version of it.  Billy Wright and others were delivering a peace process and were looking for a way out of the internecine conflict that history had helped create for us.  There is something about.  In the past few weeks, the Loyalist Community Council said: \"We want paramilitarism to go away.  We want to end these structures and habits from the past and these ways in which we do community work but we need help in that.  We need certain reassurances, and support.\"  The demonisation of loyalism, in particular, needs to stop.  We need to find a way to bring that voice as an intelligent political and cultural identity into the process and, therefore, we must be careful, when we address the issue of paramilitarism, that we do not fall into black and white answers.  We need a nuanced, imaginative and courageous engagement with those structures and we need to do it out of a recognition that these people are part of our society and our neighbourhoods.  The inclusion, while addressing issues that are unacceptable, of the people who are part of the paramilitary structure and culture is absolutely vital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Poole","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>One of the concerns for us as well is that the leadership inside these groupings is getting older and some younger people do not have a dedication to the future as a peaceful one.

I look at children and young people very much through the lens of how I was reared.  I was born in 1976 so I call myself a child of the Troubles.  Like Mr. Brady in Newry, I am a Portadown woman.  I am, therefore, only 20 miles away from him.  However, I was born and reared in an extremely sectarian town with a high level of violence.  I have been able to look at my work with children and young people through that lens because most of the young people I deal with are under the age of 18.  They are all peace agreement children.  I am finding across the spectrum that there are kids who do not care about what is happening in Stormont or anything else.  They feel they are engaging well with others and they are happy to continue with that.  There are other young people for whom sectarianism and racism have an impact on everyday issues in their lives, including their schooling, how they get home from school, how they get bussed to school, what they do outside school and where they hang around after school, and that can be in an urban or rural context.  In general, most young people, whether they say it or not, care about peace at some level.  I was doing work with a group of 13 to 15 year olds recently and we were talking about the issues that affected them.  While we take peace as a given, they also take it as a given, but they do not want to see violence similar to what we saw as young people.<\/p> <p>  Young people find it difficult to connect with the past.  Last week I had to say to them that this is living history.  They are being taught about this in school, but I was alive when these things happened and I am only 20 years older than them.  It is hard for them to connect with what we are trying to do in talking about the past.  Sometimes we put too much responsibility on them - fix the young people and Northern Ireland will be fixed.  I was a youth worker for four years and I do not agree with that.  I meet vibrant, energetic young people who want to move forward.  We recently did a report with the Integrated Education Fund on community, housing and education.  Young people said they wanted to learn together, connect together and do things together.  They want shared classrooms, but the issue is funding.  Shared education programmes are receiving less and less money.  Over the past year, in particular, the level of contact between the youth and education sectors with young people has begun to shrink.  If organisations such as ours are not doing this work, there will be less done within the school structures and the opportunities will shrink.  Many people still live in segregated communities.  There are walls in urban areas and I live at an interface.  My children have no contact with anybody who has a different religion outside of my efforts to try to do that.  They could continue to live like that for the rest of their lives if they wanted.  They can live on that interface and never interact with anybody with a different religion.  It is the same in rural areas.  I work with young people in these areas who live two or three miles apart who would never connect if it were not for organisations such as ours going in to put in some resources and expertise to help them to mix together.<\/p> <p>  With our education system and the shrinking of the youth sector and the funding for children and young people, we could continue to live in a segregated, benign apartheid for the rest of our lives, but our sector is trying its best to give young people a hand in learning, sharing and engaging with each other as much as they can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Charmain Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>Are integrated schools a way to break down that barrier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#P00400","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>Integrated education comprises only 6% of the education system in Northern Ireland.

A conflict resolution process is first about truth and reconciliation, but it is also about understanding and having an element of forgiveness and recognising people's identity.  Central to much of this is political leadership and religious leadership.

An element of dealing with that is through an educational process, whether it is shared or integrated education.

She referred in a number of her contributions to shrinking services in education in particular.  I am a great believer that if we do not empower the individual with proper access to education, training and upskilling, the cycle of poverty and disadvantage in communities will not be broken.  Integrated and shared education is aspirational for all of us and we would like it to be achieved, but we need to be careful in aspiring to the optimum goal.  Services will shrink further in the meantime and the students of today who need access to complete secondary education and to go on to third level or further education will miss out.  We will not have either achieved shared or integrated education or educated the young person going through the system.  We all work towards reaching the optimum provision of education but, in the meantime, we have to be careful to ensure that the present generation in disadvantaged communities who have not experienced the benefits they should have from the peace process do not remain in that cycle of poverty and disadvantage, which will contribute to further instability in these communities.<\/p> <p>  We had the RAPID programme in disadvantaged areas in our major cities, while the CL&Aacute;R programme was introduced in rural areas.

Would we not be better off going down the road of identifying people's needs and insisting that the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government provide adequate resources to ensure those who are in the education system or who may not be likely to complete their second level education are targeted?  The completion rates for second level education in some communities in Northern Ireland are disappointing.  There has been a dramatic improvement in this regard in the Republic over the past 15 or 20 years, and further improvement is needed.

Obviously we have the overhead renewal in those areas where people are in abject need.  That is being changed from next April through a vote of councils so we live in hope to see how that will pan out.  Just a couple of points.  Because one comes from Portadown one had the Dickson plan and fortunately one's children did not have to go through the 11 plus.  When I did the 11 plus, that was supposed to be the last year of it but my class did an experiment with us.  We had the same teacher for four years, a Christian brother.  There were 43 in the class and we all passed the 11 plus, mainly through fear, probably, and some through effort.  The point I am making is that 50 years later we are still arguing about it.  Instead of doing one examination, many children are doing five which, I think, is an absolute disgrace, but that is beside the point.  One of the issues Deputy Smith mentioned in terms of young people is integration and trying to get together.  Sport can be a way of doing that.  A couple of weeks ago I was out in Newry Rugby club.  When I was growing up rule 27 in the GAA was still in place.  One could not even look at soccer, rugby, foreign sports and so on.  Interestingly when I was growing up rugby was a middle class Protestant game in the Six Counties.  When I went out to that club there were about 60 or 70 young people, boys and girls, all at different levels, being given very good sporting activities and the opportunity to integrate yet it is struggling for funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Charmain Jones"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>Those of you who come from the voluntary sector, and as somebody who worked in it for 27 years, I am aware that much of one's time and effort is spent on trying to get funding rather than doing what one is supposed to do, and therein lies one of the huge problems.

Poverty and deprivation and all the other things we experience in conflict and the remnants of conflict are within those communities that are most impacted by discrimination and poverty.  One of the reasons I came here today was that I took the galvanising the peace conversation into Ardoyne and met some of the groups who were involved in all aspects of cross-community work.  They all work with the cross-community partner whether that is advising on housing, youth work or other aspects of community development work.  We began the conversation on how we could get back to galvanising the peace.  The conversation suddenly turned into how can we galvanise our community.  There is almost an apathy within communities and a lack of cohesion because of the impact of cuts and austerity.  People turn around and think of peace building in the absence of violence.  It was mentioned earlier that we are in a post-conflict situation.  We are in a post-violent conflict situation and we are still in this confrontation over ethnicity and whatever which still ravages our communities.  The reality is that in the absence of violence people do not see peace or the reconciliation aspect as being a priority for them.  It is almost a luxury or an abstract concept for those people who are not disadvantaged by poverty.  They are thinking of the day to day life that they lead, how to get through the next day and how cuts will impact of them.  All those issues comes into play as to whether they participate in sport and go to school.  Quite often, highly ambitious behaviour impacts on our communities.  <\/p> <p>  If I took the committee to Ardoyne tomorrow morning, at 11.15 a.m. it would see a group of about 14 or 15 young people walking around the street who are not in school.  They are out of school.  They are a needs group.  I guarantee that of those 14 or 15 young people, ten will be involved in all sorts of anti-social behaviour at night which, quite often, transfers on to interface violence.  I believe there is a huge connectivity in terms of those areas.  That can be in the Shankill Road, the New Lodge Road, Tiger's Bay or Ardoyne where the same issues are taking place.  One of the difficulties I encountered somewhere along the line was when we stood in communities, sometimes people thought it was a bad thing, 80% of the community may have voted for Sinn F&eacute;in and may have voted for the DUP but 80% of those people connect themselves to a political process or to democracy.  Now that a declining number of people are engaging in the political process, the ability of people who are anti-peace agreements means dissatisfaction grows.  It is imperative for us to go in and deal with those issues.  For most of the communities in which I am involved there has been no peace dividend.  We have the term \"transformation through regeneration\" but we see no real regeneration.  There is talk of anti-poverty strategies.  Where are they?  People have been left floundering and feeling that the war is not actually with their Protestant neighbours or any longer with the British state, it is with those people who are going to increase their anxiety with the cuts they intend to impose on them.  There is a huge anxiety within those communities.  They are turned away from the issue of reconciliation by concerns about how to get by next week.  That makes the work we are all involved in extremely difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#R01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rab McCallum"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>Does Ms Jones want to pick up on the points Deputy Smith made regarding some of the education initiatives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Donnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>I want to bring in Deputy Joe O'Reilly for a brief question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#R01300","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

Deputy Smith outlined it well.  I agree with Mr. Brady's point about sport being a medium.  All of that is necessary as well and will happen by virtue of integrated education.  As Ms Charmain Jones said, we have it at primary and preschool level but it must be got into the 11 plus area.  That is the secret.

That is something Rural Community Network, RCN, has very much tried to ensure is at the fore of our agenda, particularly young people in rural areas.  Dell had its united youth programme, which was for young people from the age of 14, to get involved in initiatives and programmes outside of school with a view to encouraging them towards education and employment, particularly in rural areas.  I know RCN, along with a couple of officials in the department, has championed that to make sure those programmes are targeted specifically at children and young people who are disadvantaged.<\/p><p>Some of these young people may not have an opportunity to engage with each other in the school environment but certainly they can do it outside school.<\/p><p> Sport plays a major role, in particular the GAA and the IFA as well.  A number of good initiatives are happening across Northern Ireland, for example the PeacePlayers International is another organisation that has been doing really good work across Northern Ireland to try to engage young people.  I think it is the role of our sector to try to encourage young people to meet each other.  If they are not meeting each other in school and a great many young people whom I meet daily are not meeting in school, they might meet each other on the way home from school.  I was told the other day about a rumpus over some uniforms in the middle of the High Street.  Any informal opportunity to meet outside school should be supported.<\/p><p> I am an advocate for the youth work sector, which I think does not get enough recognition from the informal education sector of what youth clubs and organisations and youth leaders can do for young people.  Sometimes they can bring them on the journey to reconciliation more quickly than a school can.  I know from experience that I have been able to bring young people on a journey that they would not have been able to do in school, but that was my role and I did that for three years.<\/p><p> When we are looking at education, we are not only considering formal education but the informal education sector does not get its fair share of recognition.  There is much good work happening in Northern Ireland with bodies such as Youth Action Northern Ireland, that is doing good work, in rural areas in particular on the hard contentious issues such as parades, flags and emblems, engagement with civic society and democracy.

Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned the RAPID programme, which helped areas where educational attainment was low.  The European Social Fund has a programme for young people who are not in employment, education or training, NEETs.  We did not receive funding from this fund, but we challenged the decision and were told the reason we were not eligible for funding was that we were offering the young people a qualification at too high a level.  If one is trying to support young people who are in the NEETs group, how can one ever offer them education that is at too high a level, when one wants to give them every single opportunity to achieve something?<br\/><br\/>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe mentioned the division of funding.  From our point of view the funding should not merely be divided out as all organisations in this sector have to meet the strict criteria of the Community Relations Council, CRC and<b><\/b>other funders, that call those they have funded to account for what we have done with their funding.  That is very important.  Decisions on funding must be based on need and the work of the groups in the area and must be judged by the outputs from those who have been funded.  People like us must be supported and be given funding for our work.  This is an aspect of the work that has become particularly difficult.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of policing, some of us would have been involved in the training of new recruits to the PSNI.  They would have come to our organisation for three days before ever putting on a uniform.  All of that has been reduced.  The 40 weeks of training has been reduced to 20 weeks.  Our concern is the preparation of the new recruit to step out onto the street, and his or her understanding of the context in which they are placed and being aware of the triggers from their social background and experience in the past number of years.  If we are talking about a police force that can go into any community and belong and be able to work together with a community, we have to have time to work on the issues that we are all carrying from the legacy of the Troubles.<br\/><br\/>We, the practitioners, have all agreed that there is no shared vision of what the police will look like in the future.  We do not have political leadership on that.  As part of a process of galvanising peace we would like to get people to talk about what the future looks like for them.

It goes back to the point I made at the start around expectations and assumptions.  When people signed up to the Good Friday Agreement, certainly when it was followed through at Weston Park and St. Andrews, the assumption and expectation from communities right across the board was that certain things would happen, that certain things would fall into places and certain activities would take place.  That is part of what this committee is trying to do and what the current talks are trying to do, but that was around a bill of rights, a process of some form of civic engagement, if not the civic forum, then how that collaboration would take place.  We were trying to put in place a process that would work up and down, in terms of interfaces and barrier removal, working out how regeneration would happen and when and how we would be part of the barrier removal.  For example the media is currently highlighting the barriers to the employment of former prisoners, and their ability to engage in employment.<\/p> <p>  These are some of the issues.  When we talk about a timeframe for barrier removal, the majority of people have an open view of the future.  I have never in my life met a person who voted for a 40 ft. wall in their back garden.  People want to see a plan, the planning application, and know there are the resources and budget and know what government departments and bodies will be involved and if there will be investment in regeneration.  They do not want to be left in a wilderness, where more conflict can happen when the barriers are removed.<\/p> <p>  These two important points run across many of the conversations we have had today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Donnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I now call on Mr. Poole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#S00400","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445505300,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>On the issue of the community sector, the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister set up a committee recently to look at the latest Government document on a holistic vision and strategy for the peace process, known as TBUC - Together Building an United Community.<\/p> <p>  We welcomed this document, which has a great many affirmations.  This was the first time the community sector has heard from Government.  One of the concepts is the protection of the peace and reconciliation infrastructure through financial support, funding and so on.  The irony is that this is a genuine and sincere recognition that the community structure bridges to a large degree many of the issues we are talking about, disaffected communities, disadvantaged, marginalised people who are often not listened to or heard on issues of education.  The community sector provides the means of articulation and a conduit for that voice to a large degree.  Although there is a commitment to this in that committee's recommendations, the reality is that the peace and reconciliation infrastructure is dissipating as we speak.  The infrastructure that has been built up over the past 40 years, not just in the past ten or 20 years, but the expertise, the organisations, the connectivity with communities, the awareness of the issues and the nuances that are necessary to move disaffected communities into a more confident and articulate position themselves is ceasing to exist.  Everybody around this table knows of organisations that are no longer there.  Key individuals who played an absolutely vital role in the housing estate or the local community are no longer there.

We could all speak for a considerable length of time because there are so many issues here.  Galvanising the peace process involves a number of groups that receive funding from the Community Relations Council but it is much broader than that.  It crosses sectors and includes organisations that are not directly affiliated or linked into the Community Relations Council in its funding role.<br\/><br\/>There is a huge discussion to be had about shared and integrated education.  It is a very important conversation.  One of the things I would throw into that conversation is making sure that when we talk about shared education we do not dilute it so much that we avoid dealing with the hard issues around politics, religion, sectarianism and racism.  When all section 75 categories are included, there may be a temptation to deal with sharing on the less difficult issues and not on the more difficult ones but it is certainly a useful contribution to the debate to incorporate shared and integrated education.<br\/><br\/>One of the big issues around education, which was referred to by the CRC over a year ago in this committee in our peace monitor report from 2014, is to look at the huge educational underachievement in the Northern Ireland education system.  A number of people have touched on that.  There has been some very good achievement.  There are high achievers but there is a huge amount of educational underachievement on both sides of the community, particularly within working class communities.  It is very important that hope and aspiration about the future is central to the lives of young people.  If, because of a lack of qualifications, young people do not look ahead, do not have hope and aspiration for themselves, and are told within their own communities that things are very wrong and broken, that there is no real hope for the future, then they will live in the present with a very negative outlook on what goes on around them.  That takes them onto the streets.  We need to invest urgently in the young people in those working class communities on both sides of the divide and try to invest in their futures in a way that does not mean that they have low educational achievement.<br\/><br\/>The reconciliation infrastructure has been touched on already but I want to put it into a little bit of context.  People will very often say that over the past 17 or 18 years there has been huge investment in peace building and reconciliation work and there certainly has been significant investment.  If one looks at it in the context of Peace IV coming up, a couple of hundred million pounds seems like a lot but spread over seven years and given the needs that exist in Northern Ireland it is not.  If one looks at the amount of spending that represents on investment in reconciliation work in Northern Ireland, it is something like 0.1% of total spending.<br\/><br\/>We must have a serious conversation about whether we are seriously investing in reconciliation for the future.  To put it in a slightly different context, in 2012 in Northern Ireland, &pound;60 million of public money was invested in the <i>Titanic<\/i>building.  That is a good investment and it is an outstanding facility.  It would take the Community Relations Council 30 years to spend that amount of money on funding organisations working on the ground, because we are allocated &pound;2 million a year.  We are the main regional body supporting reconciliation work.  There comes a point where one has to ask if we are adequately prioritising reconciliation in Northern Ireland because we are not doing it when it comes to investment in communities.  That infrastructure is disappearing.  I talk to community organisations all the time.  In the last six or seven months I have talked to one or two that are out of business and others that are going out of business.  These are people who do critical work at interfaces and elsewhere.  We are not sufficiently investing in that reconciliation infrastructure - 0.1% of total spend or &pound;2 million is not enough for a regional funding body.  It needs to be revisited. <br\/><br\/>The process has been described here as inspiring.  What has come across to me in the galvanising process is the expertise, commitment, professionalism, experience, and capacity of people on the ground who do this work.  In some ways it is the heartbeat of the peace process.  The heartbeat is not in political terms.  The peace process is ours - it is the people who voted for it and the people who do the work on the ground.  The people here today and the dozens of other organisations involved in the galvanising process know what they are talking about and can communicate very well what the issues are, including the short-term and long-term strategic issues.  The galvanising process shows that as we develop this peace process further and enter into a new phase of it - we are at a crossing point - the people who know what they are doing need to be heavily involved in making strategy and policy and delivering services.  If we do not do that we will store up problems for the future.  <br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee.  The invitation is always there to come out and get involved in the process.  The committee meets with many of these groups on a regular basis but the next time it is in Northern Ireland, not only Belfast, but other parts of Northern Ireland, including the rural parts, we will be happy to help facilitate those conversations.  Some of these similar issues still exist there.  There are interfaces that are relevant in rural areas, not only physically but in people's minds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015102200002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Osborne"},{"type":"speech","time":1445505300,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Osborne.

We believe that youth unemployment is a huge issue.  I come from Boyle in Roscommon in the west of Ireland.  When I was growing up in a small town of 3,000, there was a boys' national school, a girls' national school, a boys' secondary school, a girls' secondary school, and a Church of Ireland primary school.  Church of Ireland people used to go to the grammar school in Sligo or maybe King's Hospital and the well off used to go to the Diocesan colleges of St Nathy's in Ballaghaderreen, Summerhill or St Mel's in Longford.  At the time, most young men spent three years in sixth class, or seventh class as we called it, or they went to England.  I am getting out of politics now and I have been asked what I will do.  I have said that I will go back to college but I realised that I have never been in college.<\/p> <p>  Our challenges pale into insignificance when compared with the challenges in Northern Ireland.

It is our second hearing on this important general scheme of the Bill, which deals with a complex and sensitive area.  For many of us, I suppose it is an area that is also personal in that relates to the lives of those we know and love.  In that context, the meeting this morning is important.  I welcome those who are watching and listening to proceedings in a variety of ways.

It is great to have the opportunity to comment on the heads at this stage.  We would like to be associated with the comments congratulating the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on introducing this important legislation.<br\/><br\/>I do not intend to go through the detail of the paper I prepared for the committee.  However, members will see from that paper the complexities in this area of the law.  I will provide a layman's guide to what I believe the Bill contains and I hope that will be of assistance to members.<br\/><br\/>Essentially the Bill provides access to adoption information on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information, about which profound legal issues are at stake.  There is the right to identity on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other.  Those respective rights need to be balanced in any legislation that is framed.  Head 13 attempts to deal with the issues of retrospectivity and head 14 attempts to deal with the future.<br\/><br\/>Under the current law there is no comprehensive statutory right to information, which is an issue that should concern everybody.  Within the current practice there is no disclosure of information without the consent of the birth mother.  In an age when we have ratified several international instruments, that fails to accommodate the right of the child, in particular, to identity.  I am conscious that much of this legislation focuses on adult adoptees.  In the midst of this we can also forget that a core right a child has is the right to know who he or she is.  I would like to put back at the centre of this discussion the right of every child to know his or her origins and we need to ensure this becomes a core principle of Irish law.<br\/><br\/>In 2005 the national adoption contact preference register was established.  I am delighted to see Ms Susan Lohan from the Adoption Rights Alliance present today.  She has been a major campaigner in this area.  Ms Lohan and I share in common many areas of interest in how we can move forward.  Ms Lohan has legitimately criticised the national adoption contact preference register as being insufficient, and I agree with those comments.  While it is very useful for those who agree to share their information on consent, it does not provide relief where no consent exists.  In 2005 we placed the national adoption contact preference register in what is effectively an administrative scheme, but we never dealt with the big challenging issue of reconciling the competing rights to identity and to information.<br\/><br\/>Under section 59 of the Adoption Act 2010 one loses all parental rights and is freed from all parental duties once the adoption order is granted.  That is essentially where the problem lies.  That necessitates having two separate regimes.  There is the past and unfortunately we cannot rewrite the past.  Equally we cannot become paralysed by the past, which is what seems to have happened.  There seems to be a paralysis over the existence of this provision.  That is why I welcome the draft legislation.  We now need to move forward.  If we have a system where a person loses all parental rights and is freed from all parental duties, does that sunder the right of the adult adoptee to know his or her identity?<br\/><br\/>Essentially the Bill provides for the establishment of the adoption information register.  The Bill will provide the information required to apply for a birth certificate subject to certain conditions.  The conditions are twofold.  First will be an awareness campaign for a period of 12 months and second will be signing a statutory declaration.  That regime has been devised to deal with the competing rights of the right to identity on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other hand.  That is reflected in head 13 of the draft Bill.<br\/><br\/>The second regime is what happens to adoptions effected after the commencement of the Bill, which is reflected in head 14.  That provides that section 58 of the Adoption Act 2010 will be amended such that the parental link between the natural parents and the adopted child is not severed for the purpose of identity information to the adopted person.  Essentially there will no longer be a veto on the disclosure of information.  The presumption will be in favour of disclosure and that presumption can only be displaced for compelling reasons.  I read with interest the transcript from last week's hearing on the issue.  I am quite happy people had questions around the issue of compelling reasons and requested an insight as to what that might amount to. <br\/><br\/>On the role of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, it will be responsible for collecting, preserving and safeguarding adoption records.<br\/><br\/>There has been much comment on the legal issues.  We need to ask where we stand in Ireland in 2015 on the right to identity.  The courts are placing increasing emphasis on the importance of the right to identity.  Many members will be familiar with the surrogacy case that came before the Supreme Court.  In particular, Mr. Justice McMenamin placed strong emphasis on the importance of the right to identity.  We have recently passed and ratified children's rights in referendum.  Article 42A recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of children and protects and vindicates those rights.  A core right for a child has to be the right to identity.  That is hugely important in refocusing the debate on ensuring that we tell children that they have this right.  Legislators have an obligation to ensure it is not just about the adults but is also about children.  There may well come a time when children reaching 16 or 17 might have the right to seek information in respect of their identity.  That is the case in the UK at the moment and we should not lose sight of it.<br\/><br\/>There has been much discussion on the decision in the case of I. O'T <i>v<\/i>. B.  The case of I. O'T <i>v<\/i>. B did not deal with adoption and in my opinion too much reliance has been placed on this for all the wrong reasons.  I take a different view on the decision in the case of I. O'T <i>v<\/i>. B than most people do.  It is of very limited value as a precedent because it dealt with, what is called, <i>de facto<\/i>adoption - in fact it was not adoption at all.  I suppose one could distil from that certain views that might be adopted.  The comments made in that were what are called arbiter comments.  In other words judges can make comments that are not directly relevant to an individual case or by-the-way comments that are called arbiter comments and that is what happened in that case.<br\/><br\/>A possible interpretation of the judgment in the case of I. O'T <i>v<\/i>. B is that the right to information about a child's identity is a freestanding entitlement that does not depend on the existence or necessarily the enforcement of the maintenance of a relationship between parent and child.  That is worth considering when it comes to legislating.  This judgment has been held up as a roadblock to legislating in this area.  I take the view that it should not present a roadblock and it is not of huge relevance in the area.<br\/><br\/>What is of relevance - this is why I support the legislation - is that it attempts to deal with the past and the future in a manner that balances competing rights.  It refers to no right being absolute and stipulates that nobody has an unqualified right, which is important, and that those who undertake that balancing exercise are subject to independent scrutiny.  In any system it is important that independent scrutiny occurs.  It is very much to be doubted that the courts will second-guess legislative judgments.<\/p><p>The court's role is to retain constitutional responsibility for supervising the balance to be struck by the Oireachtas with regard to the two competing rights, namely, the right to identity and the right to information.  In all the Supreme Court judgments that have been handed down in this area and the tangential area, it has been stated no one right should be given automatic priority over others.  I have cited two interesting cases in my submission, namely, the leading adoption judgment of N. <i>v<\/i>. the Health Service Executive and the I. O'T. <i>v<\/i>. B. case.  In both cases, it is clear the courts are saying there has to be a process and that this process must be subject to independent scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>Another issue which has arisen is that one cannot deal with the past.  There is a problem with what is called retrospectivity.  I dispute that fact because of what the courts have stated.  In the submission I made to the committee on behalf of the authority, I have cited the judgment of Mr. Justice Clarke in the case of Cork County Council <i>v<\/i>. Slattery, in which the current sitting Supreme Court judge stated there is no prohibition on retrospective civil legislation.  Given that one is not altering the legal character of the past adoption, so long as one engages in a balancing exercise there is no prohibition on dealing with situations retrospectively.  In layman's terms, the entire narrative states retrospectivity should not be a roadblock to dealing with past cases, including historic cases.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the international position, there are three international instruments in this area.  The first is the 1993 Hague Convention.  Ireland ratified that convention and incorporated it into domestic law, as part of the Adoption Act 2010, on 1 November 2010.  Section 9 of that Act makes the convention part of our domestic law.  It is very interesting to examine this.  Under the new Bill, it is envisaged that Tusla will provide an applicant with information on his or her adoption where such information is held by the Adoption Authority or Tusla, or both.  Many members will find interesting the fact that, in terms of my reading of the provision, it appears the consent of the birth mother is not required, strictly speaking, before the disclosure of adoption information can be made in the context of intra-country adoption, which seems to be a more generous approach than exists in respect of our domestic adoption.  However, it is very clear in the Hague Convention that it is a matter for each member state to determine how to deal with the balancing of the two competing rights.  That is very clearly articulated in Article 30 of the 1993 convention.<br\/><br\/>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is a standard-setter.  Many members may ask why I am opening this matter to them this morning.  It is a very useful framework for legislating.  This is an opportunity for me to welcome the decision made yesterday by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and to acknowledge the work of Senator van Turnhout on the banning of corporal punishment.  Corporal punishment breaches a core right under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and that is why it is a standard-setter.  It provides us with a framework in which we can legislate.  There are two core rights, referred to in articles 7 and 8.  All emphasise the importance of the right to identity for a child, including when the child progresses into adulthood.  Interestingly, there are no guidelines on the balancing of competing rights.  While many would refer to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, there is not a great deal of guidance in it on how to achieve the balance.<br\/><br\/>The third instrument that is worthy of consideration is the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been incorporated into Irish law at a sub- constitutional level.  The key provision is Article 8, which concerns the right to respect for private and family life.  In this regard, there is a decision, similar to that in the I. O'T. <i>v<\/i>. B. case, called the Odi&egrave;vre decision, which again has been misinterpreted.  With a wafer-thin majority, the court decided not to disclose information.  That case can be distinguished in that it dealt with anonymous births.  It was a peculiar case decided on its particular facts, and it has been overtaken by a subsequent case, mentioned on page 15 of my submission, called Godelli <i>v<\/i>. Italy.  In the latter, there was a blanket ban on recovering information, including non-identifying information.  The European Court of Human Rights felt that it breached Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Machinery to balance competing rights is required.  The legislation provides for it.  One needs a systematic and ordered system for ensuring people understand the decisions taken when those rights are balanced.  A system of automatic non-disclosure without independent scrutiny will not be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The legislation, as currently drafted, is compliant because it provides a mechanism to ensure that one can appeal a decision in respect of how those rights were balanced.  That the legislation has a strong presumption in favour of disclosure of information is very much to be welcomed.  It is very clearly in line with all the international instruments, namely, Article 30 of the 1993 Hague Convention, articles 7 and 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br\/><br\/>The authority and I believe the right to identity is a basic human right.  We have got to start from that perspective.  We have been paralysed by the past.  This paralysis has acted as a roadblock to legislating for the right to identity.  How many children have grown into adulthood since we first started discussing this issue?  I welcome the fact that the Minister is, for the first time in robust legislation, dealing with this forgotten part of adoption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Shannon and thank him for his presentation.

It is always a pleasure to listen to him.  He has given us another masterclass and has made points I am sure will be repeated in both Houses as we debate this legislation.<\/p> <p>  It is very welcome to hear the right to identity being highlighted in the way Dr. Shannon has highlighted it.  All too often we hear about the right to privacy as if it were a right that trumped all others.  In his submission, Dr. Shannon has dealt very much with the balancing and delicate interplay of rights, and he has also reminded us about children.  To our shame, a child being adopted today does not have a right to identity.  While we can talk about the past, which we must address, we must also talk about the present.<\/p> <p>  There are three areas on which I would like to ask questions.  The first concerns the capacity and resources of the authority.  In considering the wide spectrum of records, it is not simply a matter of having a register going from A to B in which every entry can be put on file.  Rather, it is a question of the nature and types of records, their wide variety of sources and how the information is to be collected.<\/p><p>While I understand the process, that all will take time and I am aware that many of those who have approached people like me and Senator Power are getting older.  This is why time is not on our side on this issue.<\/p><p> The other issue I wish to raise concerns the legality of adoptions prior to the Adoption Act 1952 because the National Adoption Contact Preference Register only has data on a small number of adoptions.  However, the authority audited those records in 2011 and found 50 cases of illegal adoptions.  Is there a proposal to do further work in this regard?  I raised the point, in the context of mother and baby homes, that this issue must be examined and scoped out.  I have not got my head fully around how that might be done but the issue cannot be simply ignored because it is wrapped up in the issue of consent and what that is.  Consent is not having a piece of paper shoved in front of one and being told to sign it.  Some people may not even have signed anything and that does not constitute consent in any way.  The last question I wish to ask is about the \"compelling reasons\" provision, which Dr. Shannon raised briefly.  I cannot see why this provision is needed and have been trying to trawl, root and ascertain how does one ensure the bar is set so high.  My difficulty is that by leaving in the phrase \"compelling reasons\", the question of what is a compelling reason is being left open to interpretation.  In any example I have tried to provide, people have stated it would not be strong enough.  However, this is what members are debating.  Why is this being included in the legislation if nobody can give me a viable example?  Perhaps Dr. Shannon can do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#D00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon for his comprehensive presentation.  I wish to touch on one issue, namely, illegal adoptions and whether we have any real idea of the numbers involved.  I understand the number of legal adoptions between 1953 and 2014 is greater than 44,000.  Unfortunately, I was obliged to deal with one such illegal adoption case a number of years ago, in respect of which I spent four days in the High Court.  Can progress be made in trying to facilitate people?  While I acknowledge the Bill makes certain provisions, is enough being done in this area to help people?  I refer in particular to tracing and trying to go back over records in the various hospitals or facilities in which the births occurred.  Is there a proposal to consider this in a more comprehensive manner?  I understand what has been done has been piecemeal and very little assistance is available in real terms.

He has long championed the right to identity and general improvements in adoption law.  An issue that already has been touched on is that of compelling reasons, which is something about which I am deeply concerned because members do not know precisely what that involves.  There is a risk it then might open a door to challenges and uncertainty until the courts actually hear a case and decide what it covers.  In Dr. Shannon's view, is this really necessary?  We have existing legislation and, again, I cannot think of a scenario it is intended to cover.  The Minister has stated it concerns life-and-death situations and one assumes there is something about harassment or something similar or a threat to somebody's life.  Again, I do not see why this arises specifically in this context, as opposed to in other walks of life and human interaction that are covered perfectly by existing legislation.  The non-fatal offences legislation and other legislative items cover sufficiently all manner of harassments.  In Dr. Shannon's view, is this actually necessary, given that other legal provisions are in place?<\/p><p>The same is true for the statutory declaration.  As Dr. Shannon is aware, both the Adoption Rights Alliance and the Irish First Mothers group, which represents women who have been separated from their children by adoption, have criticised this provision and have stated they find it to be offensive.  It is based on an unfair assumption that adoptive people are insensitive or irrational and would wish to push themselves into the lives of parents who do not wish to have that involvement.  While this is not the case in my experience, is it the same for Dr. Shannon?  Even in situations in which people may be disappointed there will not be contact - incidentally, that works both ways, in that one can have parents reaching out and the adopted person not wishing to have contact - obviously these are difficult situations and can be highly emotional and distressing but, in my experience, people respect that.  One cannot force somebody to have a relationship with one who does not wish to so do.  Nevertheless, this is an extremely heavy-handed and unnecessary legal obstacle and is an insensitive way to deal with a minority of circumstances.  This Bill should be legislating for the majority of cases in which it will be a positive experience and there will not be issues and we should allow existing law to deal with the minority of cases in which there might be a problem.<\/p><p>On illegal adoptions, Senator van Turnhout also has touched on this point but what more can be done?  This must be a highly proactive process.  Obviously, having access to a birth certificate is completely useless to somebody whose birth certificate was falsified.  There are records throughout the State and presumably in some nurses' registers, such as the registers of Nurse Doody.  In addition, general practitioners, GPs, and solicitors were involved in informal adoptions.  As the existence of some of these records may not be known, how can this be pieced together and what would a proactive system of helping people look like?  It is really important that people who had their identities robbed from them through that process also be helped, perhaps even more so.<\/p><p>However, I again thank Dr. Shannon for the presentation.  I thought it was particularly strong on the right to identity and the misinterpretation of the I. O'T<i>. v<\/i>. B. case ,which drives me crazy and is constantly rolled out as a reason not to do anything.  Having read the details of the case, I always felt this was wrong but, as Dr. Shannon is a much more experienced lawyer than I, it was powerful and persuasive to hear him say it.  I thank him for making that contribution as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#E00300","speaker":"1200"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Shannon.

Illegal adoptions have come up on several occasions and it is a topic about which I am concerned, as Senator Power suggested, that the authority be proactive.  In terms of context, this issue was raised in an article published in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta a number of years ago.  In the aftermath of that article, I brought to the next available board meeting a suggestion that we undertake a limited audit at the time.  The figure the Senator was quoting, which actually was there were 100 cases in which there were not matches, emerged from that audit.  As to the extent, it would be foolish of me to give any estimate in this regard.  It undoubtedly is the case that there is a dark history in certain aspects of the way in which Irish society operated.  It is important that we admit to that.  As chair of the authority, I have been trying but given that we do not have an adoption file, in general the people coming to us seeking relief actually will have more information than will we on the matter.  It is an issue we certainly will continue to monitor.  I am quite struck, as I believe is the chief executive officer, by the number of people raising this issue at this meeting.  However, I must state it is an issue about which I am concerned and am anxious that the authority provides some relief.  It always troubles me when people who write to the authority express great distress at the fact that they are not in the position to receive basic information.  It was poignantly raised by Deputy McLellan, when she spoke of how such right to information is hugely important, particularly medical information, to which she referred.  I strongly am of the view that this type of information should be available to all adopted people because in terms of any genetic disorder that exists, it is difficult to advise.  Consequently, there is a profound health issue underpinning this point.<\/p><p>This is all part of that balancing exercise between identity and privacy and how that is balanced ultimately.  All I can do is assure members that the issue is getting the highest attention at authority level and that we will continue to look at what more we can do.  <\/p><p> The legislation attempts to deal with this issue and the authority will do everything possible to assist.  Susan Lohan from the Adoption Rights Alliance has been raising this issue consistently with the authority.  She was, perhaps, the first person to raise the issue on our radar.  We will continue to work with the support groups, which have been doing fantastic work in this area and have been drawing bad practice to our attention.  All I can do here is to make a commitment that we will continue to do what we can as an authority on this issue.<\/p><p> I understand people's position in regard to the issue of compelling reasons.  I want to be honest in terms of my response on this.  There needs to be some type of balancing.  It is my professional view that having some formulation, such as compelling reasons is necessary for this legislation to be constitutional.  That is my view, however it is characterised.  I share the views articulated by all members that people will have concerns that the compelling reasons will be an out in terms of not providing information.  Ahead of this meeting and having read the transcript from last week and having seen this issue raised then, I looked to see whether this provision had been used in statutes previously.  It has been used in two relatively recent statutes, namely, the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 and the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.  Therefore, it might be worth while to look at those statutes.<\/p><p> It is possible to ring-fence what amounts to compelling reasons.  I gave this further thought during the week because I understand it is an issue that will cause concern and anxiety.  Compelling reasons exist prominently in the jurisprudence around State intervention.  In the past, the State could only intervene in a marital family where compelling reasons existed.  Therefore, there is significant judicial comment as to what amounts to compelling reasons.  I wonder whether a way of dealing with this issue might be to give clear guidelines as to what compelling reasons will amount to.  I hope this response is helpful in terms of providing clarification on this issue.  The question of whether the legislation will be constitutional is dependent on having the checks and balances in place.<\/p><p> I also share the views expressed in regard to a statutory declaration.  While a statutory declaration is not an absolute necessity, some type of mechanism is required.  The points made are compelling, in terms of some type of mechanism being necessary to demonstrate a balance has occurred.  There are two systems and I would think we should look at these two very different systems.  We cannot rewrite the past.  We have had this clean break adoption system since 1952.  However, for the future, the fact we are amending the principal provision in the Adoption Act, which allows us to have a system to release information, will allow us much greater flexibility, particularly in regard to compelling reasons and the statutory declaration issue.  This is important because we are advising people and mothers at the outset of that possibility.<\/p><p> Let me give an example of this.  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act is one example.  A second example is the Children and Family Relationships Act where the provisions in terms of access to identity in respect of donor assisted human reproduction have much less onerous requirements in respect of accessing information when a child reaches 18 years of age.  It might be useful to look at that legislation as a template.<\/p><p> I will now pass over to Ms Patricia Carey to respond on the issue of resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445502600,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the question on records and files.  When we talk about adoption files, it is something of a misnomer that each person has a file.  Unfortunately, in some cases, the information or file could be as small as an entry in a register.  We are working with Tusla and the Department to begin to quantify the numbers.  An initial count estimates that nationally, we are looking at 152,000 pieces of information.  This includes everything, including files, ledgers and records.  The majority of this information is in safe preservation but as we know and as alluded to by Senator Power, we do not know where some files and records are and we have information that they may be in various private homes or nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  For the first time, this legislation will provide a basis for gathering and preserving all of these historical documents but there is a huge resource implication in regard to doing that.  Millions of euro are required and resources are needed to work with the National Archives and with specialists.  These records relate to more than 50,000 people whose lives are documented in the files.  As Dr. Shannon outlined, the right of many people to an identity is held in many of these files.  For the first time, we are giving a statutory basis to recording and preserving that information and to knowing where each piece of information is.

On behalf of the Child and Family Agency, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the heads of the proposed adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  I am joined by my colleagues, Cormac Quinlan, interim director policy and strategy, and Siobhan Mugan, national manager of the adoption service.<\/p> <p>  We wish to address the following areas: progress on the development of the adoption service within Tusla since its establishment in January 2014, with particular emphasis on the information and tracing services; the current level of service activity in Tusla; and the key provisions of the proposed Bill that affect Tusla and some key issues and concerns that we have shared with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in respect of the Bill.  I will start with the progress on the development of adoption services within the agency.  Since its establishment in January 2014, Tusla has sought to bring local adoption services under the management of one national service.  The aim is to develop a more consistent and streamlined approach to adoption assessments and our information and tracing services.  In September 2014 the interim national manager took over line management responsibilities for the majority of the adoption service staff.  The full transfer will be completed by the end of 2015.<\/p> <p>  Since the transfer to a national service, the focus has been on enhancing the information and tracing service.  I will now outline progress in this regard A programme of work was introduced to standardise the business process for the information and tracing services which commenced in 2015 and will be completed by the end of 2015.  This will ensure equity of service provision across the country.  We will have greater access to search engines and electronic databases which have been facilitated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information being sourced.  Plans are under way to store all historical records - currently at a number of locations - at one centralised safe and secure unit.  This will maximise the use of administrative staff to search historical records while allowing social workers to focus the majority of their time on information and tracing requests and support.  Tusla currently has custody of over 70,000 historical records.  An improvement plan was introduced to address the significant waiting list.  As a result, the waiting list and waiting times are being reduced.  A new system of prioritisation has been introduced.  This ensures that the assessment focuses on those in greater need such as applicants over 70 years or those with serious medical conditions.  A new set of metrics has also been introduced to provide managers with more accurate data in order to inform service developments and the effective and efficient use of resources.<\/p> <p>  I will now give an indication of some of the service activity happening within Tusla.  We currently have a complement of just over 62 whole-time equivalents, made up of social work qualified staff, counsellors and nursing staff, with approximately 22 administrative and other support staff.  There are other additional services provided though service level agreements with organisations such as Here to Help, Clarecare, C&uacute;namh and Barnardos.  In the context of service provision, in December 2014 there were 1,042 applicants on the waiting list for a service.  This was reduced to 867 in quarter 2 of 2015.  Also in quarter 2 of 2015, priority 1 waiting time was a maximum of two months.  During 2014 there were just short of 2,000 new referrals and at the end of quarter 2 of 2015 there were 521 new referrals.<\/p> <p>  In terms of key provisions of the Bill that affect Tusla, the agency welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s proposed legislation on information and tracing services and is committed to improving services to those affected by adoption both now and in the past.  To that end, Tusla has joined the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Adoption Authority of Ireland in the establishment of an implementation team.  In addition, Tusla has established three separate working groups to look at its preparation and planning for the public awareness campaign, the adoption information register and the custody of records.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline the key implications and some concerns that we have and have shared with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I will begin with the public awareness campaign.  In conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we will develop and implement a robust and high-level public awareness campaign to ensure that we maximise the opportunity to inform all relevant parties of the legislation and its implications for all those affected.  This will involve a range of media outlets and also the provision of a confidential helpline for those persons who need to speak with someone about how the legislation might directly affect them and what their rights are.  There are some concerns that even with the best public awareness campaign, perhaps elderly birth parents may be difficult to find or access and may not understand or have awareness of the changes proposed in the Bill.  Additionally, people may no longer be resident in the country and, therefore, the campaign may not reach them in other jurisdictions.  Although Tusla has practised and encouraged open adoption for many years now, which is deemed to be in the best interest of the child, some birth parents may continue to request closed adoption and do not wish to have their identity revealed.  As a result of this proposed legislation, Tusla is already informing those involved in current adoptions that the children will have a right to their identity should they wish to request it.<\/p> <p>  The National Adoption Contact Preference Register, currently held by the Adoption Authority of Ireland, will be discontinued and replaced by a national adoption information register managed by Tusla.  This will be one centrally maintained electronic database that will allow the details of parties searching for information to be entered and stored.  This will include their preference regarding the sharing of information and whether they wish to initiate a search for birth relatives.  It will be a proactive register and, therefore, once a person enters their details, Tusla will begin the process of searching for the other party to elicit their preference for the sharing of information.  Any contact or sharing will be facilitated and supported by social workers.  The register will allow for all parties, including adopted persons, birth parents and relatives to request information.<\/p><p>In most cases, the person to whom the information relates must consent before the information can be released.  Adopted adults will have the right to information to allow them to apply for a birth certificate unless there are compelling grounds to prevent this, and they also will have recourse to the court if the decision to release information is denied.  The register will also allow for those persons believed to have been subject to informal adoption or wrongful registration to seek information, where it exists, in respect of those arrangements.  Persons who have also been subject to intercountry adoption will also be facilitated in searching for information regarding their birth families.<\/p><p> It is the responsibility of Tusla to take all reasonable steps to locate a birth parent or an adopted person.  In addition to the proposed regulations to support this task, Tusla would welcome further discussion with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the authority Tusla will be given to access records held by other State agencies and what expectations and resources may be provided to locate persons no longer residing in the jurisdiction.<\/p><p> Tracing and locating birth parents or adults can take time.  Additionally, asking someone to consider their preference for sharing information in relation to a difficult decision that was made, perhaps decades ago, requires sensitivity and a strong level of trust to be established.  This equally takes time and skill and, if not done correctly, can damage the potential of further contact into the future.  If the legislation proposes that the identifying information must be shared within 12 weeks of the request being made, this leaves little time for someone who may be ambivalent about their preference and is seeking more time to consider their situation.  Tusla is also concerned that there is a maximum of eight weeks for the service to determine and make a decision on compelling grounds for dispensing with consent.  This is particularly challenging with respect to historical adoptions where there was some level of agreement that the adoption would remain a secret.<\/p><p> The maintenance and storage of all records held by Tusla will become the responsibility of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  In the interim, all records of an historical nature are in the process of being centralised in one location to ensure their effective safekeeping.  This is an interim measure until the authority is in a position to receive the records and will make the transfer between the two agencies as smooth as possible.  The transfer of records from Tusla to the Adoption Authority of Ireland will be complex as a lot of the tracing work involves cross-referencing material from different sources.  Tusla would welcome further discussion with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Adoption Authority of Ireland on how this can be facilitated to ensure access is streamlined and efficient and that requirements under Schedule 5 are considered in respect of Tusla's access to the Registry of Adoption records.<\/p><p> Tusla notes that the rule regarding statutory declaration applies to the adopted person but not to the birth parents.  In the interests of fairness and equity any requirement of this nature should apply to all parties concerned.  There is some concern that the consequences for breaching this is not set out in the legislation.<\/p><p> Tusla will continue to provide information and tracing services and some additional funding is being made available to enhance the service in order that we can respond in a timely and effective manner.  It is our intention to maximise the time that social workers spend supporting people who apply for an information and tracing service and to meet the new timelines required under the legislation.  Tusla is also working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to explore how specialist services will also be required to support children and adults affected by adoption and to support the assessment of compelling reasons for non-disclosure as may be required.  Compelling reasons can mean different things to different people.  If there is an indication that a threshold is the endangerment to life, then access to specialist assessment service may be required to determine the veracity of this as an objection or as a means of ensuring the person has access to specialist support.  Further clarity would be welcomed on the grounds for compelling reasons.<\/p><p> Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, welcomes the proposed legislation and in particular the statutory provision that will facilitate access to adoption information based on the presumption that disclosure will be facilitated in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.  For many years Tusla, formerly in the HSE, has worked with individuals who have sought to access information regarding their identity.  Where consent is not indicated or given by birth parents, only information of a non-identifying nature can be provided to an adopted person.  Tusla recognises the need for individuals, both adopted persons and birth parents, to be supported in their journey of discovery, which can be both challenging and upsetting but also very rewarding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McBride and call Deputy Sandra McLellan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. McBride and thank him for his presentation.

A few things occurred to me in the presentation, one of which was compelling reasons, something with which everybody has an issue.  I was going to ask Mr. McBride to give an example of a compelling reason but I note that he states further clarity would be welcomed on the grounds for compelling reasons.

I would like to address a wider issue in his presentation that has been raised in the committee before, which is in the area of adoption and the number of prospective adoptive parents who are coming to Tusla.  At what point does one actually tell prospective parents the reality of children who are available for adoption under the Hague Convention?  All too often, prospective adoptive parents have gone through two years of quite an arduous process for good reasons but are subsequently told there are not the children they foresaw.  They foresaw that they would get a baby, whereas the reality under the Hague Convention is that it is likely to be a teenager and more likely to have a disability.  At what point are prospective adoptive parents being told the position?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of open and closed adoption which was mentioned by Mr. McBride in his presentation, I was interested to note that to this day there are parents who request closed adoptions.  For me, this is about a child today.<\/p><p>Will the witnesses revert to us with figures on the number of parents who opt for open adoptions, which is how it should be, as opposed to closed adoptions so that we might understand?  When we discuss this issue, we too often refer to the negatives.  The vast majority of parents I meet do not hesitate to ensure that their children are fully aware of their identities.  The parents understand that they have an important role.<\/p><p> We will pursue the issue of compelling reasons in the Bill, as we all share that concern.  The bar should be high.  I would prefer it not to be included in the legislation but Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, who presented prior to the witnesses, gave us food for thought on how to balance the provision and ring-fence it as the exception.<\/p><p> I was uneasy when the witnesses referred to concerns about the 12 weeks and the transfer of information even though they also mentioned the importance of trust.  A part of that trust is built by people believing that they can get the information in a timely manner and that there will not be a bureaucratic fob-off.  This is not about the Child and Family Agency but about systems and applications generally.  People do not necessarily trust that they will get the information in a timely way.  If we do not have a clear timeline, the trust will not be there.  While I appreciate the concerns that the witnesses are raising, it affects the question of trust because it indicates that the agency is not sure it can deliver.<\/p><p> My final point is on the transfer of records.  We have been made aware that a number of bodies are in the process of transferring records to the agency.  Are there issues in that regard with particular statutory, non-statutory or private bodies?  How long does this process take?  Of what legal issues do we need to be aware in this legislation so as to ensure records are transferred and people do not use spurious reasons to refuse to transfer them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#H00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McBride.  One or two of my questions have already been asked.  It is important we centralise information on adoptees, particularly in light of the possibility raised by Senator van Turnhout of some bodies being unwilling to hand over information.  Once information is transferred, it is important it is held together and that people have easy access to it without being sent from one end of the country to the other.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of an issue with health records from a few people I know who are adopted.  It is not just about them but about their children and grandchildren as well.  It is difficult to know who they are.  Finding medical records can be difficult for people who are trying to trace certain hereditary illnesses when doctors say that is why their children are sick.  They have no way of finding out the details.  The adoptee might need to know whether either of his or her parents had the same health issue.  Is there a way to bring this information together?  This is a significant issue for all of us who have children.  We should know their health backgrounds, including mental health, so that we might know whether something might have been passed on.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McLellan asked my next question on social workers.  Mr. McBride stated that the agency had 62.64.  Is that the agency's full complement?  Is there room for more?  If so, is funding a difficulty or is the problem getting the proper people?  Social work is essential.<\/p> <p>  I am unsure about Tusla's December 2014 figure of 1,042 applicants on the waiting list for services, which was reduced to 864 in 2015.  If my figures are right, only 178 were dealt with in that time.  The other numbers mentioned throw me altogether, so the witnesses might dwell on them.<\/p> <p>  I know many people who are adopted and have since adopted children.  Seeing people reunite on television after generations is touching.  All they want to know is who they are.  I watched an amazing programme the other night - I cannot remember on which station - about family members from North Korea and South Korea meeting for the first time after being separated.  Their window of opportunity to meet their families was just six hours before they had to return to their quarters.  Many adoptees in Ireland do not even have that window to meet those they lost during the adoption transition.  Anything we can do to alleviate their longing and fears about who they are and why certain aspects of their lives do not fit into place would be important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#J00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McBride for his opening statement.  He mentioned the number of social workers.  Is that the full complement in Tusla, including child protection, or just those devoted to the adoption side?  What level of extra staffing and funding would the organisation need to make the records accessible - Mr. McBride stated that cross-referencing the information would be a large job - and run an efficient information and tracing service?  He also mentioned the current waiting times and that it was two months for priority 1 cases.  Is that the time it takes someone to get a first meeting or to get the information released?  How much time does it take after the first meeting to get the information that is being sought?  How is that affected by resources?  What percentage of people on the waiting list are classified as priority 1, that is, they are urgent cases and Tusla hopes to see them within two months?  What is the average waiting time and what is the longest waiting time?  People have told me they have been waiting for two years or longer to get the information.<\/p> <p>  Given how the Bill is structured, proper staffing will require the involvement of social workers at various stages.  This will be resource-intensive and present people with a challenge, as they will have to wait for long periods before someone becomes available to help them.  The experience of many birth parents who dealt with social workers when being separated from their children was not a positive one.  For that reason and regardless of the credentials or approaches of the social workers with whom they deal now, they are reluctant to engage with anyone from that profession.  Some have been working with counsellors with whom they are comfortable while some are more likely to rely on the support of others.  Must the process require social workers in the way that it does?  Under a provision in the Bill I introduced last year with Senator van Turnhout, birth mothers and adoptees could engage with counselling professionals of their own choice.  The professional would have to be properly accredited and a member of the appropriate professional bodies but this provision meant that instead of having to wait for a social worker in Tusla to be assigned to a case and to avoid instances where people are not comfortable with that concept, one could find someone she or he was comfortable with in line with the guidelines set out for the process.  Information sheets on how the process should work would be given to the counsellors.  This is preferable to the social worker-driven model.  What are the witnesses' opinions on this point?<\/p> <p>  It was stated that the register would be proactive and that once a person entered her or his details, Tusla would begin searching for the other party to elicit that person's contact preference.  Will this be the case even where someone is registering for the purpose of making it clear that her or his preference is for no contact?  For example, if a birth mother registers to put on record her preference for no contact, will a search still be initiated?  I am seeking clarity on this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#J00300","speaker":"1200"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445502600,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>Perhaps I will pick up on the issue of resources since a number of members raised it.<\/p><p>Colleagues may chip in on some of the other issues.

Of course, we must carefully plan how we will use those resources.  Suffice it to say that adoption information and tracing is one of our priorities in our business plan.  We realise some of the performance indicators need to improve and, therefore, some additional resources will be required.

This would come as a shock.  Some of the women are now in their 80s and this would have happened 30 or 40 years ago.  Many of them would have been married for a long time and have grown-up families and grandchildren.  They would never have told anybody anything about this.<\/p> <p>  The 12-week period is an issue because we must build trust with these people to work with them.  We must give them time to come to terms with what happened in the past and an opportunity for them to speak to their husbands, partners, children and, potentially, grandchildren and wider family members.  We must remember that when these people handed over their children for adoption, whether they wanted to or not, there were societal pressures.  They were made to feel very bad about their cases and, although society has changed, they have continued to live with this all their lives.  Nobody has told them that it is okay or whatever.  They are reliving that time and trauma.  Much of the work we do with these women is about spending time with them, counselling them and supporting them in working through the issue and the possibility of some sort of a contact, even if it is a phone call, letter or permission for some information to be shared.  The 12-week period is very tight for that.  The committee can imagine any of us having to tell a secret we have held for 40 years, so we need a bit more time for assimilation.  These women are in their 80s, so it is not easy.<\/p> <p>  Compelling reasons brought to us by some people might include them not telling their husband, for example, their partner or the wider family.  They may feel that these people may leave or that the mental health distress of reliving the trauma of 30 or 40 years ago could mean they need mental health services.  In that sense, should we add to the stress by saying that the information will be issued in any case?  We have to meet a few women in car parks or in very isolated areas so they are not identified.  It is about working through the process with them, as these women can be very distressed.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about metrics.  We have expanded metrics to give a bit more information.  In the past, there was much anecdotal information about who was searching, whether we found people and if there were many refusals.  There is more on which to expand.  With adoptions today, we inform people of the process in information sessions when they come forward to say they are interested in adoption.  We outline eligibility and the likelihood of getting a child at the end of this process.  That is done initially when people come forward and it is talked through in the entire assessment process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Mugan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445502600,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>I was trying to cover the question about the number of prospective adopters but we may have to revert to the committee on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>That is fine.

With the information campaign, we must differentiate between the right to identity and the right to contact.  People should understand there are differentiations and we should consider how to support people in that regard as well as advising people of their rights and protection in some circumstances.  In the 12-month period proposed, we want people to engage with us early and well.  There is indication of a kind of confidential helpline for people who may be ambivalent.  We want to be able to support people and talk them through their worries in order to give them every opportunity to express their preference early so we can begin our work early.  In that, we want to make them aware of their choices, and I am particularly conscious of choices in the context of adoption.  Many of these parents or adopted persons did not have a choice at certain points in their lives, so we must ensure that we can now facilitate them with a sense of choice and power.  With choice comes responsibility for that choice and that has implications for some people.  With new adoptions, we want an open approach from the outset.<\/p> <p>  With respect to information and tracing, we hope the majority of cases will involve a level of consent.  There will be cases where people are ambivalent, as Ms Mugan mentioned.  We need to engage with these people, support them and help to communicate where the adoptive person or birth parent is at.  Through a dialogue and consultation with the parties, it is hoped we will be able to overcome barriers, as we have done already.  People have established defence mechanisms over much time and when these are taken down, those people can become vulnerable, so we must be conscious of that.  We do not want to delay people's access to information or damage any future potential for contact in identifying information.<\/p> <p>  People have spoken about compelling reasons.  Within the proposed Bill, it is clear there is an indication of a level of threshold - that might be endangerment to life - but Ms Mugan has spoken about other circumstances.  If we are making an assessment within a period, some issues will require a more specialist assessment.  A social worker has absolute skill and ability to do this and there are very experienced social workers in the adoption service.  In some cases, we may need additional support and that is why we are seeking clarification in that regard.  We very much see this as a journey for people and they will have access to different types of information at different stages in the journey.  The people from the Department spoke about that on the last day.<\/p> <p>  On the centralisation of records, we were very keen to achieve this on a number of fronts.  The first is the protection of records, as some are very historical, and we want to ensure they are safe and secure.  We have spoken about how we are centralising our service nationally to provide a more streamlined service.<\/p><p>We want to maximise the use of clerical administrative staff to make sure they do the searching and the social workers&rsquo; time is focused on the direct contact with adopted persons or birth parents to maximise our ability to get a better response to those cases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445502600,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>Senator Power asked some very specific questions about waiting times and so on.

We have also introduced two priority waiting lists.  Priority one is for people over the age of 70 and people with serious medical issues and concerns and for any matches on the contact preference register.  At the moment we are down to between two and four months, from the allocation of a social worker to starting to do the search.  The search depends on how much information the client has and how long it takes to find somebody.  It involves a trawl of records, maybe parish records, the General Register Office, GRO, records and trying to trace somebody.  That takes time.  Data protection can mean the work takes a little longer because while in the past the parish priest might have been quite happy to give information, now he says he cannot.  We are sometimes caught in those situations and we are aware that in many cases applicants can find more through Google.  The role of the information and tracing service is not necessarily finding a person but supporting the person through that process and helping with the reunion.  In some cases, for those on the generic waiting list it can still take two years.  We are working with a large quantity of records that are not in file format, not scanned and not on an electronic database.

I appreciate the sensitivity of that point.  In the picture she painted what percentage are they of those who come forward?  My difficulty is that we hear about these exceptional cases and we do not hear about all the joyous occasions or the hunger on both sides.  As a keen genealogist, I am very aware that a person with any type of unusual name and an idea of the townland, can get eight certificates from the GRO for &euro;4 each immediately.  I could get those and over several weeks order as many as I wish for the GRO to e-mail to me.  There is a great deal of information available.

Are there issues that we as legislators need to address to ensure those barriers are not raised in front of the agency?<\/p> <p>  Ms Mugan mentioned non-identifying information.  The nature and scope of the non-identifying information given depends on where a person lives.  The Child and Family Agency does not seem to have a consistent approach.  I am not talking about the different types of record because I fully appreciate that there are different types.  This is down to individual social workers, some who have been brilliant and really try to give as much non-identifying information as possible, others will literally tell the client: &ldquo;Your mother was a woman.  She lived in a rural area.&rdquo;  Can we not give people more?  What is the agency doing to ensure consistency by social workers when they approach this work?  Will they have to be trained?  Mr. Quinlan spoke about public awareness but when people approach the Child and Family Agency will they get that consistent response?

It is really important to make the distinction between information and contact.  Surely what causes distress in those situations is the prospect of unwanted contact, not the information.  I completely understand the situation.  That is why our Bill provided that the adoptee&rsquo;s birth parents' current details should only be given out with their consent.  That is fair enough.  One cannot force people to have a relationship if they do not wish to.  The adopted person has a right, however, to his or her identity.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon, who addressed the committee prior to this session, spoke very strongly on that constitutional right.  There should be no compelling reasons to deny information.  I accept that contact is a sensitive issue but it is a separate issue.  It is important to understand that.  That can be dealt with by reassuring the birth mother that her husband will not open the door to find her son or daughter standing on the doorstep, that the process already includes a provision by which the adopted son or daughter will be told whether the mother wishes to have contact.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to understand that because birth records are public records if somebody wants to do a trace he or she can.  There are no intermediaries, which means there is a greater risk of unwanted contact at present.  As things stand, the only way an adopted person can find out if his or her birth parent wishes to have contact is to reach out because there is no intermediary.  The system we are putting in place will make unwanted contact less likely because it has the right protections and supports for everybody involved.  I cannot stress that enough.  It is really important.  I do not accept that there should be any compelling reasons.  There is other legislation to deal with issues involving endangerment of life.  If compelling reasons are to be included they need to be incredibly restrictive.  It cannot be a general notion of distress because that is far too all-encompassing and potentially leads to the adoptive person&rsquo;s right being reduced to nil. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#L00500","speaker":"1200"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1445502600,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>Getting the message about public awareness right at the beginning is very important to reassure people and provide clarity on those issues.

The legislation is of huge importance to people who have been affected by adoption, and addresses some very challenging legal issues, so I am grateful to the committee for taking the time to provide pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, and I very much look forward to considering its views during the detailed drafting stages.  The Government made a commitment to modernise and reform outdated elements of family law, and to consolidate and reform the law on adoption.  The Bill is an integral part of this reform agenda.<\/p> <p>  Adoption can provide children with the invaluable experience of growing up in a loving home, an experience of which they would otherwise have been deprived.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have been privileged to meet many adopted people who have spoken passionately about how the love of their adopted parents is one of the most important things in their lives.  However, I am also acutely aware that many people affected by adoption did not have a positive experience.  Adoptions conducted in conditions of strict secrecy, under the crushing weight of oppressive social stigma, have meant that in the past, too many people have had a very negative experience of adoption.  Some felt they had little choice but to give up their baby for adoption.  Without doubt, the historical experience of adoption in Ireland failed to recognise the central importance of identity information to our sense of self, and it is this legacy that we seek to address in the Bill.   I do want to stress, however, that we should not allow our history to define the modern experience of adoption.  The reality of adoption in Ireland now is very different than in the past, and one of the aims of the Bill is to further enhance the adoption process, so that in future adoption is a much more positive experience for children and for both sets of parents.<\/p> <p>  Many of those seeking information about their natural parents have emphasised the support they got from their adoptive parents in their quest for information.  It is important that adoptive parents fully embrace their responsibilities to support and assist their adoptive children when they start to ask questions about their background and identity. <\/p> <p>  For many of the women who were separated from their babies, the legacy of adoption has been a sad, and often lonely, one.  Some felt they had no real choice but to give up their child for adoption, and have struggled with that decision ever since.  The secrecy in which adoptions were conducted in Ireland the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and perhaps later, meant that many of these women had to carry that burden alone, keeping the secret even from their husbands and subsequent children.  I fully understand the difficulty these women may now face in coming forward but I encourage mothers whose children were adopted in the past to consider contacting Tusla, or the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  They will be afforded confidentiality, care and empathy and the chance to get appropriate support, information and guidance about a period of their life is that undoubtedly the source of much pain.<\/p> <p>  Is there noise coming from somewhere?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#N00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>We can hear one of the TV monitors showing live feed from the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#N00500","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>I am always delighted to hear my constituency colleague, but not during the course of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#N00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>We will turn down the volume down.

My overall policy objective in bringing forward this legislation has always been to provide access to as much information as possible to adopted people.  The heads of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill provide for a comprehensive restructuring of the adoption information and tracing service, including setting out what information can be provided, and in what circumstances, for both past and future adoptions; providing for the management of adoption records; and placing the adoption information register on a statutory basis.  I believe the Bill is a major breakthrough in dealing with the complex challenge of balancing the rights of birth mothers and adopted persons in regard to information and tracing.  I take this opportunity to thank the staff in the Department for their commitment to finding a balance that would give due respect to the rights of everyone affected by adoption.  The officials have worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General, and I also want to place on the record my thanks to the Attorney General and her office for the legal advice provided to date, and for her commitment to continue advising me as work on the heads progresses.<\/p><p>We are all clear on the outcomes that we wish to achieve, those being, to vindicate adopted people's right to information about their identities and protect birth parents' right to privacy.  My Department has carried out a detailed policy analysis of the evidence surrounding the need for identity information and its importance in enabling adopted people to form a sense of self, something that many non-adopted people can take for granted.<\/p><p> The legal advice that I have received indicates that the right to know one's identity flows from the legal relationship between a birth mother and her child.  However, I am also advised that the effect of an adoption order, which breaks that legal relationship, is to restrict that right to know.  All of us have a right to privacy and protection of that right is constitutionally guaranteed.  The advices that I have received are clear, in that we cannot simply dispense with anyone's right to privacy, including that of birth mothers, or retrospectively change that with new legislation.<\/p><p> However, the issue is far more complex for adoptions that have taken place in the past.  Our goals are clear: to provide a legally guaranteed right to identity information for adopted people and the offer of support for those who wish to make contact.  While we know that, in practice, people affected by adoption respect one another's privacy, we must also ensure the protection of that constitutional right if the Bill is to be legally sound.  There is no doubt that it has been challenging to find a formula that provides for both of these goals.<\/p><p> For adoptions prior to the Bill's commencement, a key provision of the Bill is to provide adopted people aged at least 18 years with a statutory right to the information required to apply for their birth certificates.  A birth certificate contains important identifying information, which is shared by an adopted person and his or her birth parents.  In this respect, it is different from other identifying information that can be more readily characterised as belonging to one person or the other.  When the adopted person is provided with the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate, he or she will be asked to make a statutory declaration to respect the birth parents' right to privacy or, in practical terms, their right to be left alone.  In situations where a birth parent does not currently want to make contact with her or his adopted child, the statutory declaration aims to provide birth parents with reassurance that their wishes will be respected.  In these circumstances, an adopted person declares in law that he or she agrees not to contact or ask anyone else to contact the birth parent and to seek the assistance of Tusla's information and tracing services if he or she wants to make contact in the future.  There is no requirement for a statutory declaration where a birth parent consents to identifying information being released or where a birth parent is deceased.<\/p><p> Recognising that tracing birth parents and seeking identity information can raise painful issues for all involved, birth parents and adopted people will be offered appropriate support and guidance by a Tusla social worker.  Finding a way of ensuring that both parties have access to this information while respecting each party's right to privacy has been challenging, but it is my belief that the provisions of the Bill strike that balance in a fair and respectful way.<\/p><p> Secrecy and lack of information are our enemies in this endeavour.  People can be reluctant to place their names on a register because they do not know what the consequences might be.  The difficult experiences that many people affected by adoption have had can mean that they are fearful of change.  As such, it is important that everyone has an opportunity to familiarise himself or herself with the new legal framework and the rights and protections it affords.<\/p><p> On commencement of this legislation, we will embark on a year-long extensive information campaign to publicise its provisions and to encourage adopted people and birth parents to enter their details on the adoption information register.  People who are considering sharing information or having contact with persons they were separated from as a result of adoption will be encouraged to engage with Tusla's information and tracing services.  The information campaign will highlight adopted people's right to the information required to apply for their birth certificates and explain to them the content of and need for the statutory declaration.  Birth parents will be made aware that they may indicate a preference of \"No Contact at Present\" on the adoption information register and that they can change their minds about this if they are ready.  Once the awareness campaign has been conducted, adopted people will have a statutory entitlement to the information required to apply for their birth certificates.<\/p><p> These provisions are designed to achieve the necessary balance between adopted people's right to identity information and birth parents' right to be left alone.  By providing for a high-profile awareness campaign, support and guidance for those who want or need it, the statutory declaration and the possibility of appealing to the courts, we can achieve a fair balance between these rights.<\/p><p> It is important that future adoptions be conducted on the basis of an explicit understanding about the identity information that must be provided.  The Bill also provides that, for future adoptions, adopted people will be able to apply for a copy of their birth certificates, adoption orders and other information.  It provides for the sharing of information between birth and adoptive parents about the adopted child where both parties agree.  In addition, it provides for information to be given to an adopted person whose adoption is registered on the register of inter-country adoptions.  Persons who were the subject of so-called informal adoptions and wrongful registrations and their birth parents are covered by these provisions and can avail of services and be provided with information where such information is available.<\/p><p> The Bill would establish an adoption information register on a statutory basis to allow people to indicate their preferences regarding contact and-or sharing of information.  Tusla will be responsible for operating the register and providing information and tracing services.  It will facilitate and support contact between parties as requested.  Support and guidance will be offered to all persons who request contact and-or the sharing of information.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland will be responsible for collecting, restoring, preserving and safekeeping adoption records, including information on informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations.  The Bill will set out the information that must be retained by the authority for future adoptions and, in so far as it is available, for past adoptions for people on the register of inter-country adoptions as well as informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations.<\/p><p> As members may know, many adopted persons and birth parents are exchanging information and have had reunions.  This has been facilitated by Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and a number of agencies.  I thank them for the contribution they have made to date in the provision of information and tracing services and I look forward to continuing to work with them.<\/p><p> When the committee has concluded its valuable work on this Bill, I will consider any issue identified and make the necessary amendments to the heads of the Bill.  Adopted people are validly asking questions about their identities.  Due to the nature of historic adoption, they have often been prevented from getting a comprehensive response.  This Bill is about providing a right to identity information, not a right to contact.  Birth parents can be afforded no less a protection of their constitutional rights than the rest of us.  The safeguards in the Bill, including the ability to specify preferences regarding contact, will provide birth parents with the reassurance they need while ensuring that adopted people can access important information about their identities.<\/p><p> I hope that this first important step will lead to positive reforms and better outcomes for adopted people, their families and birth parents.  I also hope that it will provide people affected by adoption with the time and space to reconcile themselves with the often painful experiences of their pasts, free of the suffocating fear and stigma that has too often characterised the historical experience of adoption in Ireland.  I am determined that we will learn from the past.  We will learn from the experiences of the many children who were given loving homes by adoptive parents and strive to ensure that the negative experiences of the past are eradicated.  This Bill will help to enhance the experience of adoption by providing for something that is fundamental to every human being, namely, information about who he or she is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#N00800","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.  I compliment the Minister, which is not something that I do regularly, on bringing this adoption legislation as far as he has.<\/p><p>It has received cross-party support over the past number of years.  We recognise the importance of giving people the fundamental right to information about their identity, as the Minister described it.  I also compliment Senators van Turnhout and Power on the work they did bringing forward a similar Bill in the Seanad last year.  There is widespread support for this and I compliment the Minister on it.  I look forward to engaging with him about it.<\/p><p> Due to circumstances, key stakeholders who were due to appear before the committee last week could not do so.  It was nobody's fault but was because of the awful tragedy in Louth.  It is important that, after engaging with those key stakeholders and having heard their views and concerns, we might have an opportunity to engage with the Minister again to thrash out the issues those stakeholders might feel are not addressed in the heads of the Bill that have been presented.<\/p><p> I wish to make some observations.  The Minister said: \"I hope that it will provide everyone affected by adoption with the time and space to reconcile themselves with the often painful experiences of their past, free of the suffocating fear and stigma\".  It is awful that a negative stigma has been attached to adoption in the past.  It was inappropriate.  I wonder if the signing of a statutory declaration is really warranted.  Certainly from the limited engagement I have had with people who have been affected it is clear that they feel there is no need for it.  They do not intend to harangue or stalk their natural parents if there is a clear wish for no contact.  Is the declaration necessary?  How effective is it?  Effectively, it is toothless because there are no sanctions in place.  Perhaps the Minister would discuss whether there is a need for it.<\/p><p> I have concerns about the capacity of Tusla, which I raised previously with the Department's officials.  Unfortunately, I missed the presentation from Tusla this morning.  At present, given the limited information that is available through Tusla, there is a savage backlog of people waiting to get that information and to interact with it.  This is a time sensitive issue.  People are getting old and they want to find out about their identity.  The Minister was able to secure additional funding for Tusla in the 2016 budget but when one considers all of the different sections within Tusla that will be seeking additional resources, can he confirm that the body will be given a ring-fenced budget to ensure it has the necessary capacity to deal with this new legislation in a comprehensive and effective manner?<\/p><p> The other issue is the 12 month lead-in period.  Again, given how time sensitive this matter is, could that period be reduced?  To compensate for a shorter lead-in period there could be a more intensive and wider campaign to ensure people are aware of the provisions of the Bill and the criteria that will be attached to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#O00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for the presentation.  I welcome the fact that this legislation will finally be brought before the House.  Many people have waited a long time for it.  We all acknowledge that everybody is entitled to know their identity and their health footprint.  Even in non-contact situations everybody should be entitled to their medical records.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues were covered today.  The main issue is compelling reasons.  There has been much discussion about that today, ranging from thinking a compelling reason is a matter of life and death to it being, perhaps, distress.  We seek more clarification on that.  Who decides what distress is?  There are two parties involved in this and just because one party might be distressed, it does not mean they are more distressed than the other party.  We must have clarification on that.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of Tusla appeared before the committee earlier and they, too, were seeking further clarification of the compelling reasons grounds.  They stated that compelling reasons can mean different things to different people.  In addition, who will make the ultimate decision on what the compelling reasons are?  Is it Tusla or a social worker?  I got the impression from their presentation that it might be a social worker, although perhaps I misread it.  Social workers are very experienced, but in all walks of life some people are more experienced than others and there will be people going into social work straight from college and they would not have the experience to deal with it.  Who ultimately will make that decision?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the appeals process, is it just an appeals panel within Tusla or is it a civil legislation matter?  Would there be a cost involved in the appeal and who would cover that cost?<\/p> <p>  Regarding Tusla's budget, is the Minister confident that it has the budget required to deliver all of its responsibilities?  We know it got additional money in the budget, but that money must be divvied out to many different organisations ranging from family resource centres and refuge centres to employing extra social care workers.  The after-care Bill was introduced in the last couple of days and now we will have the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  Does the Minister think that the extra funding Tusla has been allocated will cover all of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#P00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him and his officials for the work they have done on this Bill.  As the Minister said, we are anxious that people can access as much information as possible and that this can be done in a sensitive manner.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon appeared before the committee this morning and he said something quite striking, that we cannot rewrite the past but, equally, we cannot be paralysed by the past.  That is what we are trying to ensure here, because all too often we have allowed the past to paralyse us.<\/p> <p>  The first issue I wish to raise is compelling reasons.  As nobody can give us an example of a compelling reason we are all trying to work out where the bar or threshold is.  My fears around it were warranted.  As Deputy McLellan said, one of the scenarios outlined to us in the presentation from the representatives of the Child and Family Agency was a situation of distress.  My understanding was that it was not a compelling reason.  Perhaps we should seek to ring-fence it, as Dr. Shannon said, and perhaps look at other areas.  It is something we must re-examine.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will not have seen Dr. Shannon's presentation, but he gave us a very excellent paper that challenges and gives evidence on the interpretations to date surrounding the right to privacy and the right to identity.  It shows why we must bring up the right to identity.  It is not that privacy will trump it.  He gave us an excellent paper with examples and I am sure the Minister will be provided with it.<\/p> <p>  Like others, I am also concerned about the statutory declarations.  Will it be enforced?  If I sign something to say I will not do it, does that stop my husband taking it on himself?<\/p><p>I am trying to work through that idea.  Does it have to be a social worker with whom one interacts?  Could it not be a counsellor or somebody else, as Senator Power and I proposed in the Bill we brought forward in the Seanad?<\/p><p> Another issue that arose this morning is the accessing of records by the Child and Family Agency.  What authority will the agency have to take reasonable steps?  It gave us an example this morning of accessing parish records.  Some parishes have cited data protection reasons and will not allow access to their records.  It is a major concern that the agency will not be empowered to take reasonable steps.  Perhaps we need to probe a little into what exactly constitute reasonable steps.<\/p><p> On the presentation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland, I am concerned about the issue of illegal adoptions, particularly those that took place prior to the 1952 Act.  An exercise was carried out by the Adoption Authority which identified 100 illegal adoptions in a very small sample - I thought the figure was 50.  It is very concerned about that and said it wishes to do more work.  I ask the Minister to interact with the Adoption Authority to resource that work to ensure that it does happen because that is too much part of our past.<\/p><p> On the information and awareness campaign, I was reassured to a certain extent by what Cormac Quinlan of the Child and Family Agency said to us this morning about how it will be done.  Perhaps the Minister should ask that when a plan has been devised, it will come before the Joint Committee on Health and Children so that Deputies, in particular, because they meet so many individuals, will understand the public representation issue.  It is a good place to discuss the public information campaign.  We get one chance to get it right so we need to test it first and I think this committee should have a role in that.<\/p><p> The meetings were not in the order that we had wished them to be.  The Minister made a commitment to look at the committee's recommendations when its report - which I hope will be timely - is produced and put them into the heads of the Bill.  I appreciate that commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#P00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  This Bill will go a long way to help people who have been adopted.  It is important that they get all of their information and it will give closure to many of their lives.  The right to information about their identity will go a long way in that regard.  It is also very important that we do not forget the rights and privacy of their parents.  It is important that money is ring-fenced for Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and other agencies to help them look after adopted people and their families.

We have come a long way since he was in the Seanad with us earlier in 2015 to discuss the Bill Senator van Turnhout and I brought forward last year.  He expressed a desire to do something but also a concern that he might not be able to introduce a retrospective system.  I acknowledge that we have come a long way in the interim.  I appreciate the work that the Minister has put into this so far.<\/p> <p>  I have two concerns about the Bill.  They are the same concerns that have been raised by the Adoption Rights Alliance, Irish First Mothers and others - of which the Minister is aware - about both the compelling reasons and the statutory declaration.  It is important to distinguish between information and contact.  I accept that the birth parents' contact details - or the adopted persons' details, when it is the other way around - should not be given out without their consent.  However, as was quite clearly pointed out to us this morning by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, an adopted person has a right to his or her identity.  There are two separate issues.  A person cannot be forced to have a relationship if he or she does not wish to but the adopted person's right to is or her identity is a different issue.  While there are valid reasons for withholding someone's current contact details there are no valid reasons for denying an adopted person a right to his or her birth certificate.  However, I understand that there are concerns.<\/p> <p>  In our discussion with Tusla, one of its representatives cited situations in which it might cause distress to the birth parent to know that the birth certificate is being released.  I suspect that the cause of any possible distress, in the minority of situations in which that might occur, is a fear of unwanted contact.  It is not about the information; it is about unwanted contact.  Current contact details are not being released.  There are processes to ensure that this does not happen.  By creating an intermediary in the way that we are here, the risk of unwanted contact is lessened.  An adopted person can do his or her own tracing using public records to find out who is his or her birth parent.  It is an exhausting and difficult process but the only way to find out if the birth parent wants contact is to reach out and ask.  There is greater risk of unwanted contacted in the current arrangements.  The arrangements that the Minister is putting in place lessen the risk of unwanted contact and that should be sufficient to allay any concerns.  The compelling reasons criteria are unnecessary.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Conor O'Mahony, who has not been in with us yet, has sent us a copy of his submission.  He argues quite strongly, from a legal point of view, that there should be no exceptions.  He is concerned that the definition may be construed as non-exhaustive and could open the door to other reasons being used to deny access to a birth certificate.  Barnardos makes the point that while the Bill provides for compelling reasons to deny an adopted person the right to his or her information, there may be compelling reasons why the adopted person needs that information.  It seems that we are looking at only one side of the equation here.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.  There are better ways of getting around it.  Barnardos argue that, instead of the statutory declaration and the exclusion in some circumstances for compelling reasons, a better way to deal with the sensitivities when a person does not wish to have contact is to provide the adopted person with access to an individual or group preparation session.  It has recommended a system similar to what we had provided for in our Bill, which is that before the birth certificate is released, the adopted person will have a meeting with a counsellor and discuss the birth parents' contact wishes.  A conversation would be had about the contact wishes so that consideration would be given to the needs of the birth parents.  Dr. Fergus Ryan is quite strongly of the view that this would meet the constitutional requirement.  I accept that there are measures needed to ensure that the Bill is constitutional but there are better ways to do it.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that Tusla is given the resources it needs to run an efficient service.  I question whether social workers need to be involved in this process.  For many birth parents, even the idea of going back to a social worker is a difficult for them because social workers were involved in their being separated from their children.  Instead of requiring people to wait for appointments with social workers, it would be preferable to allow them to consult a counsellor of their own choice, as we had in the earlier proposed legislation.  There would still be that conversation and that professional support but instead of forcing them to use somebody who they are not happy with they could use a professional of their own choice.<\/p> <p>  Tusla raised the issue earlier about access to the records of other authorities.  That is absolutely essential.  We have to use every means available to the State to get the information - the Department of Social Protection, PPS numbers and any other records.  We need to look at the data protection laws to make sure that there are no impediments.<\/p> <p>  I stress the importance of this legislation getting through the Oireachtas and becoming law before the election.  It is great that we are finally at the point where we have a Government that will legislate for this area.  It has developed a huge head of steam since I first started to push for it a few years ago.  I request that the Minister begin drafting the Bill now before he receives the committee's report.  The legislation can be changed to take on board our suggestions on compelling reasons, the statutory declaration and any other changes recommended by the committee.  It is complex legislation.  It will be helpful to begin the drafting to ensure that we can get the Bill through as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#Q00300","speaker":"1200"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>The purpose of pre-legislative scrutiny is to hold the hearings before the Bill is drafted.

It is not something he does frequently.  This Bill is a major breakthrough because, for the first time, people who have been adopted and parents of children who were given up for adoption have a road map to follow.  It is very important in the interests of closure that they are able to do this.  I do not know whether it will give them the closure they want, but at least it is a step in the right direction.  The one-year campaign to make people aware of this legislation is also important, as is the information that should be given.<\/p> <p>  I lived beside Goldenbridge industrial school when I was growing up.  I used to see the children going to school.  They were not educated in the same classrooms as other children and I often wondered why they were educated separately.  Somebody told me one day that they were called the \"lost children\".  That is what they were in many ways.  For various reasons, they found themselves in an environment in which they really should never have been in the first place.  The stories of many of these lost children are now being told.  On a personal level, I know at least 30 people in the parish where I live who were adopted.  They were adopted into families that gave them love and care.  Most importantly, they were raised in an environment in which the door was always left open to them to search for their birth parents if they wished to do so.  We have to acknowledge that many children who were adopted went to really good homes.<\/p> <p>  I know who I am and where I came from.  I have learned that my family started off in Athy some time in the 16th century.  I never even knew that my predecessors came from the country.  Having studied the history of my family tree, I am aware that I have roots that were generated somewhere.  I do not know where my predecessors came from before that, but I know that they came from there in the 16th century.  That is very important for me and my family.  I really believe it is important for us to know who we are and where our roots are because it is part of what we hand on to our children.<\/p> <p>  I spoke previously about people I knew who were adopted and had health issues.  The problem is that many of their health issues have been passed on to their children and grandchildren, but they do not really know the extent to which they are hereditary.  This issue is very important to them.  I hope this process will bring closure to some of the issues that have affected people for generations.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the Minister and his staff because any legislation that passes through the Oireachtas takes a great deal of time, work and effort.  Above all, it takes great dedication on the part of people we never see at this committee.

What is seldom is wonderful.<\/p><p>Many members have referred to the need for a statutory declaration.  I know that it is a real concern for people who were adopted.  They believe it is insulting to them to be seen as different from others.  They wonder why they should have to sign for their information.  It is a question of the legal position in which we find ourselves <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Constitution.  In this context, I will certainly look at the submission Dr. Shannon made.  All of the information we receive from the committee will be hugely helpful to us.<\/p><p>Perhaps I am getting things a bit back to front, but I would like to respond to what Senator Averil Power - she might be a Deputy soon - said about drafting before the report.  We were very keen to do something like that.  We considered it and talked to the Attorney General's office about it.  Two issues arise in that regard.  First, the drafters felt many changes might be needed and wondered whether they really wanted to double up on their work at a time when they were under so much pressure.  Second and more importantly, it would have been insulting to the committee to pre-empt what it might come up with by saying, &quot;here we have it already drafted.&quot;  This was the point made by the Chairman.  We will do everything we can to make this happen as quickly as possible because there have been many delays, but it is complex.  However, we believe we now have the key that opens the lock.  Everybody will be working very hard.  I know that the Attorney General and the T&aacute;naiste are committed to making this happen.  The same applies to me and my Department.  I hope the Senator will accept our bona fides in that regard.  I am aware that she does not always do so.<\/p><p>The aim of the legislation is to improve life for everyone and Irish society.  As a politician, I really believe that when opportunities such as this come along to improve things, they should be grasped with both hands.  The statutory declaration is seen as the device that will allow us to address the issue of the constitutional right to privacy.  As I said in my opening comments, I fully accept that in practice, people respect others' right to privacy and do not make contact with them.  The absolute view is that this provision has to be included in the legislation in order that it has a legally sound basis under the Constitution.  If other information that comes through from the hearings changes that view, of course, we will look at it.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the need for resources to speed up contact.  We have already made provision in the Bill that the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform will be asked to pony up, if I can put it that way, for any cost that might be incurred as a consequence of the enactment of this legislation.  It will be done with the consent of that Department.  It has been mentioned that a huge number of additional social workers are in the pipeline.  They will come through this year and next year and have been budgeted for.  Our challenge will be to recruit them.  To be honest, it will be a challenge for Tusla which will receive every support we can give it.<\/p><p>Deputy Robert Troy spoke about the one-year lead-in period.  He referred to the sensitive nature of this matter and mentioned that those involved were getting older.  Time is certainly an issue for the birth mother, but we can certainly look at that issue again.  Our advice at the time was that one year would be a reasonable and legally defendable period of time.  One sometimes thinks everybody is in agreement on certain legislation, only to find that someone challenges it somewhere.  We need to have a legally sound basis.  We want to protect the legislation as best we can.  We do not want it to fall on some minor legal point.  We will, therefore, look at this aspect of the matter.<\/p><p>Deputy Sandra McLellan spoke about medical information.  It will certainly be available.  It is the property of the person concerned.  There may be some issues about it being identifying information.  My own view as a doctor is that people are entitled to their own medical information.<\/p><p>The &quot;compelling reason&quot; issue was raised by Deputy Sandra McLellan.  We are still looking at it.  The best advice we have received to date is that it must involve the endangering of life.  Being distressed does not endanger life.  It is not pleasant, but it does not endanger life.  The ultimate decision will be made by Tusla.  It is an operational decision within it.  It will be made by the people on the panel that it has put together to make the decision.  They will have to be very careful because all of these decisions will be open to a court challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#R00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#R00400","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>This issue was also mentioned by Senator Jillian van Turnhout, who asked where the bar was.

Senator Averil Power mentioned that when we were in the Seanad, I was not sure about how far we could go.  I am pleased that we have been able to get over this hurdle through the work of people in the Department who have found a way to unlock this issue.  Our driving ambition is to give as much information as possible and encourage people to make contact where possible.  I refer back to the national contact register in this context.  The new approach will be entirely different from the current one, under which we have to wait for both parties to match on the register before we can link them.  Under the new system, when someone joins the register, we will look for information on where the other person is located, contact him or her and ask him or her if he or she would like to make contact or know more.<\/p><p>An approach that has worked well is to ask those who refuse contact whether they would like to know whether their adopted child or the parent is still alive.

However, as I do not know when the next general election will be held, I cannot give cast iron guarantees in that regard, but we will certainly do as much as we can as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#S00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>Does the Minister have any sneaking suspicion about the election date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#S00400","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>No, people attribute far more knowledge to me than I possess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#S00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>Will the Minister consider the requirement to avail of a social worker under the new model?  The proposed model will be highly resource intensive, particularly given the difficulties being experienced in recruiting a sufficient number of social workers in the area of child protection as matters stand.  Will the Minister consider changing the model?  While a meeting with an appropriate professional such as a counsellor accredited by the relevant bodies is necessary, the professional need not be a social worker employed by the Child and Family Agency.  As Barnardos noted in its submission, it also runs a service, yet there appears to be a presumption in the Bill that it would no longer do so because Tusla would provide the service.  There are a number of other good independent services in operation.  Perhaps a little more flexibility could be shown in this matter to ensure the model will work better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015102200002#S00600","speaker":"1200"},{"type":"speech","time":1445502600,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>That is a fair point and one we will certainly consider.
