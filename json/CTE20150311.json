During our sessions this week, we will hear from a number of witnesses on the theme of relationships between state authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  Later this morning, we will hear from Professor Niamh Hardiman on systems of governance.  However, at our first session this morning, we will hear from Professor David Farrell, a professor of politics at UCD, to discuss the issue of public policy in parliamentary democracies.  He is a member of the Royal Irish Academy and a specialist in the study of parties, elections, electoral systems and Members of Parliament.  His current research focuses on the role of deliberation in constitutional reform processes.  In 2012, he was elected as president of the Political Studies Association of Ireland.  In 2013, he was elected as speaker of the council of the European Consortium for Political Research.  He is founding co-editor of the publication <i>Party Politics<\/i>.  Prior to his move to Dublin, he was professor and head of social sciences at the University of Manchester.  He is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As the witness has been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I invite Professor Farrell to make his opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#A00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426032000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak to the committee.  I have been invited to speak about the role of parliament in scrutinising government.  My paper has been circulated.  I propose to pick out some of the main features of the paper, if that is acceptable, and I will try to keep to time.  I apologise in advance if I inadvertently offend anyone in anything I say.  I am not a specialist in parliamentary procedure.  The members are and all of them know how this Parliament operates.  I am just an academic, a theoretician.  I have some knowledge of how the systems work in other countries, and that is the main reason I have been invited to contribute to the discussions.  If I make mistakes in what I say about the way in which the Oireachtas operates, I apologise.<\/p> <p>  In my comments, I want to observe a general consensus, which is that the Parliament in Ireland is weaker than in most other countries.  That is the context for my paper.  What I want to addresses is the question of whether this might have contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the banking crisis.  I have framed the note in two parts.  I want to start by giving some general ideas on what we might consider to be an \"effective parliamentary democracy\".  I will set out the three main features of an effective parliamentary democracy and then address each of them in regard to the Irish case.<\/p><p>Starting with an effective parliamentary democracy, we might reasonably expect it to consist of three factors.  First, the parliament should be organisationally and structurally suited to fulfilling its scrutiny role over government.  What I mean is that we should see some appropriate structure both in its plenary sessions and in its committee structures.  In terms of its plenary sessions, among the things one gets from the literature is that the parliament should be able to determine its own agenda, to varying degrees in collaboration with the government.  However, the parliament has a big say over its own agenda.  At the heart of this is a chair of the parliament who is elected by the Members of the parliament, MPs.  In virtually all of the other European cases it is by a secret ballot of the MPs.  Regarding the committee structure, one should see that the committees have a very major role in the legislative process.  That would include, among other things, sufficient time for committee work.  The features I pick out include the proportional allocation of chair positions among the parties; the election of the chairs by secret ballot of the members of the parliament; the notion that committee membership is not a right but a privilege; the notion of a well staffed and well resourced committee structure.  These would be the main features of what we might expect of a well structured parliament.<br\/><br\/>Second, it is one thing to think about the parliament having control over its own agenda, but if we are to see it also operating effectively we must also think about the culture of the parliament and how it is attuned to its role as a more equal player <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the government.  The second main factor of an effective parliamentary democracy is a culture of effective parliamentary scrutiny.  How this plays out in parliaments today, particularly in the last part of the last century and the first part of this century, is through its committee structure.  We should see an effective use of the committee structure as the core to this.  In those parliaments with effective committees there is a tendency for many of the members of those committees to take their committee role very seriously.  Some even see the committee as an alternative career route to ministerial office.  We see committees that follow a tight schedule of policy scrutiny, with meticulous attention to tracking the detail of the policy process, careful background research, well structured interviewing of witnesses and a philosophy of operation that specifically eschews ambulance chasing.<br\/><br\/>There is a third feature of an effective parliament.  One might have a parliament that is well structured and a parliament whose members take their role very seriously, but the third link in the chain is a culture of open and transparent government.  This obviously relates to a robust freedom of information regime, whistleblower legislation and the like.  However, it also relates to how the government interfaces with parliament.  The government and its agencies must be prepared to work with parliament in providing access to information and to key officials.  Of particular relevance to the work of this committee, I would argue, is an open budgetary process and the right for parliamentarians to quiz heads of agencies and senior civil servants on policy and operational matters.<br\/><br\/>Those are the three main features of an effective parliamentary democracy.  How does the Irish Parliament relate to that?  As I said earlier, the first point relates to the strength of the parliament.  The consensus among academics is that the Irish Parliament is one of the weakest in Europe.  It is not just the academics who say it, the politicians also say it.  Look at what happened in the most recent election in 2011.  Every political party represented here put parliamentary reform very high on the agenda in their manifestos, so it is clear that the politicians think this.  A key feature of the programme for Government of this Government is a commitment to deal with parliamentary reform.  D&aacute;il reform was also a topic that was taken up by the Constitutional Convention as one of the agenda items it chose to examine.<br\/><br\/>It is the weakness of the Oireachtas that explains why so little attention is paid to it in the three reports we have had to date on the banking crisis.  Having read through the three reports in preparation for my presentation today, I was struck by the absence of attention to the Oireachtas.  The only thing I could find was in the most recent, 2011, commission of investigation report which says, in passing, that one of the causes of a systemic financial crisis is likely to include a parliament that remains unaware of the mounting problems.  That is the only reference I could find to the Oireachtas.  Given the recent flurry of interest in D&aacute;il reform, it would be nice to think that this issue has been resolved.  There is not too much evidence that the issue of a weak D&aacute;il has been resolved to this date, and I will be happy to discuss that matter in further detail during the questions and answers.<br\/><br\/>The second feature is the question of whether there has been sufficient scrutiny by the Oireachtas.  It is one thing to talk about the weakness of the Oireachtas, which I have just outlined, but it is quite another to see to what extent the Oireachtas has been making use of its existing powers.  As I outline in my document, committees already have quite substantial powers.  I list them on page 4.  The question is whether the committees were prepared to make sufficient use of those powers to test the veracity of the Government and other regulatory offices that were suggesting things were fine in the lead-up to the banking crisis.  The second point is the lack of scrutiny by the Oireachtas and whether a culture shift is required by the Oireachtas to address that.<br\/><br\/>The third feature of an effective parliamentary democracy is open government.  That relates to active engagement by the government with the parliament of the day, or Oireachtas in this case.  As I set out in my report, as a Westminster democracy we follow what is found in Westminster democracies.  First, there is a very tightly controlled, highly secretive budgetary process with a fixation on budgetary secrecy.  That question was meant to be addressed.  In the programme for Government in 2011 the Government talked about how it could open up the budget process to the full glare of public scrutiny.  We have yet to see that.<br\/><br\/>The second feature in the open government agenda is the issue of the ability to question senior civil servants.  The protocol followed in this country is that the Minister's word is final.  Any advice that might have been provided in conflict with the decision of a Minister is not divulged, and certainly not divulged to the Parliament.  In a context in which we know now, from the reports, that there were differences of opinion between Government Departments over the direction of economic policy leading up to the banking crisis, it should be possible for a senior civil servant to provide additional information to an Oireachtas committee on the different scenarios that might have been explored in the lead up to a decision.  Arguably, it should even be permissible for a civil servant to inform the committee of areas where he or she may have been in disagreement with their Minister.  That issue was raised in the Labour Party manifesto of 2011 and was included in the programme for Government: &quot;Restrictions on the nature and extent of evidence by civil servants to Oireachtas committees will be scrapped, and replaced with new guidelines for civil servants that reflect the reality of authority delegated to them, and their personal accountability for the way it is exercised&quot;.  I would hazard the argument that we get to see that.<br\/><br\/>In my main conclusion, what I draw from all of this in the period under scrutiny is that the Irish Parliament performed poorly.  It lacked sufficient organisational and structural fire power to provide effective scrutiny.  It lacked the political will to use what powers it did have, indicating what I call cultural shortcomings, and it was hindered by a governmental system that places great emphasis on secrecy, particularly in its dealings regarding budgetary matters.  There is little evidence to this day that those matters have been resolved.  My overall argument is that if the Parliament has sinned in any regard relating to the origins of the banking inquiry, it is more in respect of sins of omission than sins of commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you.

It is only by way of a fundamental overhaul that a cultural shift might be realised.  If only one or two things are changed, the culture of how the process operates will not change.  There is a need to change how the whole system operates.  In effect, I am suggesting issues such as what it is that motivates a Member of Parliament to be an active member of a committee need to be examined.  There is no doubt that this committee is a model of good practice and that its members take their role very seriously, for understandable reasons, given the subject matter of its deliberations.  Having appeared before and observed other committees, I argue that, in comparison with committees I have observed in other countries, there is a need for reflection on how committee work in this system is done.  While it is largely about changing the structures, it is also about changing how members treat their committee role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Pearse Doherty, in his written opening statement and oral commentary to the committee Professor Farrell said the failures of parliamentary practice in terms of oversight were more sins of omission.

There has been much talk about D&aacute;il reform, but we have yet to see serious D&aacute;il reform.  With the singular exception of pre-legislative scrutiny, there has not been serious engagement by this or previous Governments with D&aacute;il reform.  What many of us have been arguing for in terms of parliamentary reform - as I set out in passing in part of my paper - is a secretly elected Ceann Comhairle and a clear agenda for root and branch reform of how the D&aacute;il operates, with an equivalent exercise being undertaken in the Seanad at the same time.  There is a need to look at how the D&aacute;il can have a much greater say in setting its own agenda and the allocation of its own resources, with other reforms relating to how committees are formed, including the notion that committee membership is more a privilege than a right.  It should be the case, perhaps, that a Member would be appointed to no more than one committee and that committee work is viewed as a serious part of a Member's parliamentary work.  There should be committee weeks in order that committee members would have the scope to get on with their committee work, quite apart from any other legislative work.  There should be proper resourcing of committees and proper resourcing of the parliamentary function rather than the resourcing of individual parliamentarians.  I could go on, but these are the sorts of thing that have been mentioned and bandied about and on which we have yet to see any serious engagement.

They have a parliamentary role to play and should be serviced in that role.  If we were starting with a blank sheet, what I would be advising - others would agree with me on this - is that resources should be given to committees.  I can see that this committee is well resourced, but that should be the norm rather than the exception.  The library and information service should be better resourced than is the case.

That is one of the abiding features of the consensus parliaments of continental Europe - a coalition accommodating an inclusive notion of government.  A coalition government is comprised of several parties, hence the need to co-operate and work well.  There is also a notion that at any given time one party might be in or out of government.

If we were to go down the road of having committee members able to speak the unspeakable across party lines, and even vote across party lines on committee reports, with the understanding it might still go back to plenary and there would still be the possibility of the Government saving the day if it was particularly worried about its legislation, at least it would start to instil the notion that individual parliamentarians have their own voices and are able to think their own thoughts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Professor Farrell mentioned the powers committees already have.

Professor Hardiman is associate professor of political science and public policy.  She has studied at UCD and Nuffield College, Oxford, and worked for a time at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.  For several years, she was a fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, where she was the tutor in politics before moving to the school of politics and international relations in UCD, where she is director of graduate studies and director of the interdisciplinary public policy programme.  Her research interests centre on the political economy and public policy.  She is interested in the politics underlying policy outcomes, the politics of how public policy priorities are formed and implemented, the implications of institutional design for good governance and the political economy of growth, distribution and redistribution.  Among her recent papers are work on comparative fiscal responses to crises, methodological challenges arising from analysis of fiscal policy choices, the political economy of housing bubbles, new approaches to thinking about the European periphery, the effects of crisis on State structures, the implications of State structures for vulnerability to crisis and the fiscal foundations of the State.  Professor Hardiman is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>Before I begin, I wish to advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As she has been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I have been invited to talk about governance practice in Ireland.  I think that the broad outlines of the banking crisis are familiar enough.  We know that the banks borrowed too much, they made too many risky loans and too little heed was taken of the growing property price bubble.  So, from a political science perspective, some of the key weaknesses that stand out for me are, first, there was too little oversight and accountability going on in the Irish political system.  The banks, we now know, were too lightly regulated, but in political life, too, the powers of Parliament to scrutinise policy were, in my view, too limited.  There was not enough accountability for things that go wrong, so it was often hard to learn the right lessons for the next time, or even better so there would not be a next time.<\/p> <p>  Second, politicians and key public officials in some respects may have had too little distance from powerful private sector interests.  Third, there was too much consensus over policy priorities and critical views were marginalised.  There was too little specialised knowledge in the public service and there was a resistance to using expertise effectively.  Each of these features of the political system is in conflict with principles of good governance.  I would like to sketch in some of the institutional weaknesses that made these kinds of problem possible.<\/p> <p>  For a political scientist, institutions are important because institutions that work well are crucial for good political outcomes.  They create the framework for people's interactions with one another.  That is what an institution is.  However, even good institutions can end up being run badly or operating badly, so there is always a need to have appropriate incentives to keep good standards of conduct going.<\/p> <p>  When we are thinking about good governance, there is not actually any single agreed definition.  It is always something that is under debate, but there is an influential contribution to this debate developed by the Quality of Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, which says that good governance depends on what it calls the impartiality of institutions that exercise government authority.  In this sense, there are two aspects of impartiality in the way that the State relates to its citizens.  One concerns what I might say is the input side of things, that is, who gets access to public authority.  The principle here is that privileged groups should not be able to gain preferential access to decision making in ways that would distort considerations of public interest.  The other side of things is what I might call the output side of things, the outputs of political decision making, that is, the way political authority is exercised.  This means that procedural rules and guidelines should always be respected and no individual or group should be either favoured or discriminated against.<\/p> <p>  So far, so good.  We might say \"relatively uncontroversial\", because these formal principles are well represented in Irish public life, but if we think about the Irish experience, we can see that there are a number of weaknesses in institutional design and in actual political practices.  I want to identify three areas that correspond with the three sets of problem that I mentioned just a moment ago.  These are about, first of all, political oversight and accountability; second, the relationships between political actors and private interests; and, third, the contestation of ideas.<\/p> <p>  First, thinking about political oversight and accountability, governments have to manage public affairs, but policy also needs to be challenged and government needs to be held to account.  We have a power dimension, one might say, of the exercise of public power and also a legitimacy dimension.  It is more difficult in Ireland than elsewhere to scrutinise and amend legislative proposals and more difficult to hold the Government to account.<\/p><p>I believe this was the subject of discussions the committee held with Professor David Farrell in the last session.  His, and other research, indicates that the Irish Legislature is still a bit of an outlier in comparative perspective on these indicators.  Accountability within the public service is also a problem.  We are not always good at learning from mistakes when things go wrong in the public service.  Too often we are inclined to say that the system is to blame and we leave it at that.  All this is in the process of change at the moment.  The Civil Service renewal plans are aimed at reforming the ways the Civil Service functions and includes procedures to improve and strengthen accountability.  This is all very much a work in progress.  <\/p><p>  My second point is about privileged access to decision making.  There should be distance in the relationship between private interests and public authority in both input and output.  We know there were close relationships between banks, builders, developers and political leaders during the years of the boom.  This is potentially a problem on the input side of things.  It may present a problem for Government's ability to take a measured view of its policy options or to establish enough distance and aggregate all the preferences it is exposed to in a public interest perspective.  We have legislation on standards in public office, regulation of political donations and freedom of information legislation, all of which really do help to reduce the incidence of inappropriate access and influence - but poor practices may be harder to control or eliminate.  Our ethics legislation dates from 1995 and 2001 and I do not think many people would suggest there were no problems at all in the years that followed.  Making sure that legislation has the desired effect may not be quite so straightforward.  <\/p><p>  One way of having strong accountability in other European countries involves the strong role of parliamentary committees, but this is an area where there have been some weaknesses.  When we think of regulation in the financial sector there is also a gap between what the formal rules say and the way informal practices actually play out.  The powers that were available to the financial regulator before the crash were, as I understand, not excessively weak, but enforcing an effective regulatory regime is another matter.  The Irish form of light touch regulation was never going to get full disclosure of risks and liabilities on the part of the financial institutions.  Ireland was not the only country to commit taxpayers' money to providing guarantees to the financial sector, but there are a couple of things that stand out about the Irish experience.  Policymakers had fairly limited access to any kind of accurate information about the true state of the banks before the guarantee was extended.  This is a problem which goes back well beyond 2008.  It is a clear failure of the regulatory regime.  <\/p><p>  Although large guarantees were extended in other countries, they did not necessarily have to put them into practice.  The difference lies in the organisation of the banking sector itself and the links they had with each other.  Denmark for example committed 259% of GDP to guaranteeing its banks and Ireland committed 232% - similar orders of magnitude.  While the Danish taxpayers were eventually liable for something like 1% of GDP, in 2012 it was estimated that the direct cost of the guarantee to the State was around &euro;64 billion, which is 41% of GDP.  It seems that the Government in Denmark was able to negotiate a sector wide rescue scheme which involved a lot of participation by the financial industry itself.<\/p><p>  I am not saying that the Danish experience is directly translatable to Ireland, there are many problems in trying to translate practices from one country to another, but what it does illuminate is that the Government seemed to have very little insight into what was going on until it was too late.  As one analyst said it was \"torn between denial and panic\" when it was too late to do anything other than step into the breach with large guarantees. One might well think that in a small country like Ireland it is quite difficult to maintain appropriate distance between the regulator and those who are regulated, or between the powerful, wealthy business interests and the politicians.  Many of these people come from similar backgrounds.  They went to the same schools and may even be related to one another.  All of this plays a role in lowering the boundaries between the personal and the official political roles.  However, Denmark is also very small and socially interlinked.  Institutions need to be well designed and appropriate incentives and sanctions should encourage good practices to try to avoid the worst happening in the first place.  This involves informal practices as well as the formal rules and sanctions.<\/p><p>  My third point is about groupthink and critical evaluation, groupthink meaning when critical judgment is not properly exercised.  Peoples' opinions converge on what is perceived as general wisdom without subjecting it to too much criticism.   Many people have commented on the scale of groupthink during the boom and this was clearly a problem, not just in the case of bank risk, but in macroeconomic policy more generally.  Ireland was far from unique in this naive faith in the self regulating market and the ideas that property prices were going to rise forever, there was going to be a soft landing and that this time is different.  This time is never different.  However, at the same time there were dissenting voices - people sounding the necessary warnings.  There were those who were uneasy about bank risk and the sustainability of the property boom.  Sometimes these people may have lacked the confidence to speak out too loudly, but there were enough who raised their doubts and their warnings.  For the most part they were criticised or even ridiculed.  The question now is how to create a space for those people who offer an alternative point of view, even though it is unpopular, so they get taken seriously and that countervailing opinion gets factored into the discussions, perspectives and anticipations?<\/p><p>  Among the safeguards against groupthink in public life there has to be: high quality information available; a public service that can use the information well; practices such as having open environment for debate; critical engagement with different points of view in different fora; and encouragement of contestation over ideas in the policy process.  Open debate is the basis for informed analysis and good policy formation.  Developing the policy capacity of the public service was not very high on the list of political priorities during the boom.  Indeed, during those years there was a proliferation of new agencies.  Why were they created?  It was because often it was easier to do new things by adding on new skills outside the existing public bureaucracy.  We now have a lot of State agencies and there is a clear rationale for many of them.  Agencies which operate at arms length from Government can serve a valuable purpose.  In other cases one might have expected these new positions to be created inside Government departments themselves but instead we have this agency proliferation.  In 2008 the OECD commented, not favourably, on what it called the \"organisational zoo\" of Irish State agencies. <\/p><p>  Good policy making also needs access to good technical skills of all sorts and these are improving now.  We have the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, but there are other areas where there are skills and competence deficits.  There have been questions, for example, about the management skills of the senior civil service.  Reform is under way in these areas, but it is still very much a work in progress.  We want the public service to act as a guardian of the public interest.  To do this it needs to maintain a culture of independence from political influence.  In formal terms that is well established in Ireland, but we sometimes hear it said that some senior civil servants may be less willing now than in the past to challenge Government ministers' points of view.  There may be a number of reasons for this.  In other countries, when a government is in power for a long period of time, civil servants may be more likely to align themselves with Government preferences.  The way we organise career promotions may encourage anticipatory adjustments.  It may be that civil servants are under a lot of day-to-day pressure to protect their Minister from criticism and from bad publicity in what is an intensely media saturated policy process.<\/p><p>Until quite recently, if individuals wanted to expose things that have gone wrong they could expect very little protection.  We now have The Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  That goes a good way towards remedying this, both in the private and the in the public sectors.  Here again if we want the legislation to have the effect that we want more is likely to be needed.  There has to be a culture of encouraging critical engagement.  The most effective way of doing this is to develop an environment in which debate and disagreement is normal, where discussion is not shut down too quickly in the interests of getting a decision, where people do not feel that their right to speak out is determined by their place in the hierarchy.  <br\/><br\/>Critical analysis is exactly what universities do.  We engage in information, research, evidence and so on.  Some progress has been made in engaging the universities in critical debate about public policy and public sector reform, but I think more could usefully be done.  We can also think about the role that civil society organisations may play, an active role as watchdogs over the public interest, over regulatory and other bodies.<br\/><br\/>Inside the banks themselves we can now see that there were weaknesses in corporate governance to do with this phenomenon of group think.  Banks engaged in very risky lending practices not least because their own shareholders put pressure on the directors to match the performance of the most profitable institutions, which were also the most risky.  No bank can grow its profits at the extraordinary rates that we saw during the boom, in a safe manner.  The brakes were off inside the high street banks too in terms of internal vigilance.  It might be useful in this regard to think about the differences in the governance of the Irish and the Canadian banking sectors.  The Canadian banks did not suffer systemic crisis this time around.  One contrast between the two systems is the fact that the Canadian financial regulator played a very strong role.  Bank directors expected rigorous and even painful scrutiny by the regulator and they internalised that expectation in the way that they conducted their own directorial responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>Inside the banks, the way the banks functioned also shows some interesting differences.  As I understand it, directors can influence board decisions and bank outcomes through very much the same sort of practice that I mentioned a moment ago, good information, good preparation, an ability to ask hard and unexpected questions, a willingness to be critical and challenging towards management and to hold them to account effectively.  In Canada, some of the corporate practices provided a stronger framework than may have been in existence in Ireland for encouraging these behaviours.  For example, Canadian directors often, it seems, hold <i>in camera<\/i>sessions without management present.  This lets them test ideas and build support among colleagues.  This seems to have helped the non-executive directors to avoid excessive deference towards managers and it strengthened the independent and challenging voices on corporate boards.  <br\/><br\/>In conclusion and in summary, I think what I have been focusing on is this feature of good governance centring on the idea of impartiality.  Good institutional design is vital, but so too are the practices that make institutions work effectively.  In the Irish case, this has implications in three areas that I have outlined.  My first point was about political accountability.  I noticed a relatively weak capacity to subject the Executive to scrutiny.  Improving accountability is still in its early stages. The second point is about the relationship between private interests and public office holders and this needs to be constantly monitored.  My third point is about the risk of group think and this persists as long as there is too little respect for informed critical opinion, too little willingness to look for high quality information and too little openness to debating and contesting ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Niamh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Hardiman for her opening statement.

Ireland and Britain stand out as having particularly weakly developed powers available to the legislature.  This is usually measured in terms of the powers and competences available to parliamentary committees, powers of compellability of witnesses, powers to command papers, but also agenda setting of the work of the parliament itself, the time-tabling within committees, the ability to get amendments accepted inside committees, the degree to which committees work along party political lines, the ending of debate and the guillotining of debates in committees.  All those indicators suggest that in Ireland and Britain the parliamentary committees have a weaker scope of powers available to them.  Many continental European countries have stronger powers.  The strongest of all are in Scandinavian countries, it seems, and in the Netherlands where committees have extensive powers to set agendas and so on.<br\/><br\/>To what degree is this influenced by the electoral system?  There is extensive debate about the Irish electoral system and electoral system reform is the first answer whenever anything goes wrong.  I am not so convinced.  Practices and expectations might not necessarily be changed by having, for example, a list PR system.  One of the things that is encouraged in continental European systems by having a list system, is the ability to prioritise getting people elected on account of their policy competence but there is a price to be paid for that and that is that they get onto party lists without necessarily having to have a very close association with their constituency base, with their electorate.  I do not have to tell that to people here.  You are all elected politicians.  You know much better than I do what it takes to get elected.The very strong features of the Irish electoral system are that it enables a strong connection with the local electoral base and to have a strong sense of responsiveness to civil society.

In the context of the banking crisis things did go wrong in the banking sector before.  There was a financial sector collapse in 1984 and I wonder if the right sort of lessons were learnt about risk that can happen inside financial institutions and the sort of oversight that may be required at that point.  We know, for example, that Pat Gallagher was subject to criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland and many commentators have asked why that was or why these were not pursued in the Republic.<\/p><p>I do not know the answer to that question.

During the 1990s growth in productivity and adding new resources to the economy were generating a strong export performance and a strong performance in traded services.  After 2000 there was a shift towards investment in capital stock, most of which was going into construction, especially housing.  There are many reasons for this.  The Irish population was growing and there was a housing shortage; perhaps the early indicators of the housing bubble that were first explored in the late 1990s did not necessarily see the full magnitude of what was coming along.  The context had changed a great deal, of course.  By 1999-2000 we were living in the eurozone and very cheap credit was available.  We now see the fiscal incentives to facilitate additional economic activity in the area of construction were misplaced in terms of generating a long-term sustainable growth model.  They were also unwise in a context where it was becoming very much cheaper to borrow and use money in the banking sector.

As there is very little scope for evening out the economic cycle, corrective measures are introduced at a time when they are most difficult.  One of the corrective measures is the type of thing that has been put in place in recent years in the form of the Fiscal Advisory Council, to have an independent advisory body to provide information and expert and informed commentary on Government spending plans.  It would not stop the Government.  Irish Ministers for Finance have a tremendous amount of discretion when it comes to devising and implementing fiscal policy.  The good side of that is that when a quick turn around in policy is needed, as we saw in response to the crisis, Irish Governments, in the context that they have good networked governance in the wider society, which we can discuss as well, have the capacity to make policy and implement it quite well through a very effective public administration system.  They can turn around quite quickly.  The balance side of it is that if disadvantageous or perhaps unwise fiscal policy is being pursued, there is very little friction in the system.  There are very few institutional breaks.

Among the principles of good regulation are two essentials, the first of which is expertise.  It is important to ensure the regulatory system has strong expertise in the area it is trying to oversee because regulators are there to stop people from doing things they want to do.  When people want to do things, they will try to find ways around the rules.  Recently in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>, for example, Gillian Tett commented on the fact that the stress tests for American banks were possibly too lenient even still because the regulatory system was imposing stress tests that were too predictable.

They were of the view that, in the absence of a transfer union, a banking union, debt resolution and all of the things we have now learned as so important, it would prove somewhat problematic.  Maintaining an independent exchange rate regime was very challenging for Ireland at the time.  On the whole, compliance with the requirements to join EMU worked well for Irish economic performance in terms of the policy process.  In the early stages, most people expected that upside would be very strong and that integration with the wider European economy would be facilitated by the single currency, that trade would improve, that our export links with other eurozone countries would be intensified and so on.  Adaptation to the new policy regime, whereby there was no control over exchange rates and monetary policy, was probably slow in coming because it attached new importance to the domestic capacity to manage by using just cost-containing mechanisms, fiscal policy, etc.  What people did not realise was all the perverse incentives that would spill out from having such low interest rates.<\/p><p>That was a shock that was genuinely hard to manage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#Y01900","nonspeaker":"Professor Niamh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The new, ethical and open complex that the professor has described to us sounds most interesting.

At the time I am speaking about, some banks were growing profits at a rate that most expert commentators would have thought to be unwise.  There would have been a question about the riskiness of the business model they had been pursuing.  If there was nothing illegal about what they were doing and if they were not constrained by regulation from what they were doing, there was nothing in essence to stop them other than what their own internal audit or risk management might have suggested.<\/p> <p>  My observation is about the pressure this puts on other financial institutions that are also responsive to their own shareholders.  When an economy is in this exuberant state, people expect their investments to yield a good return.  My comment is that people should be sceptical about the durability of the business model that their money is tied up in.  The economist, Hyman Minsky, is often cited nowadays because a long time ago he developed a model whereby he predicted that crashes were inevitable, that financial crises will recur and will happen for different reasons next time, but they will happen.  They can be worse or less damaging, but they will be driven by the acceleration of expectations that there is money to be made.

In my letter of 12 February, I sought to clarify parts of my evidence to the inquiry on 15 January.  I have prepared these short introductory remarks on the presumption that the inquiry has invited me back on this occasion to amplify my views on the alternative courses of action that might have been taken by the Government at the end of September 2008.  Perhaps I should recall explicitly that I myself had no involvement in the guarantee decision, so my views are based on what I learnt from preparing my May 2010 Report on Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy, as well as on many conversations with other experts and on my general knowledge of banking crises in other countries.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a critique of the decisions of end-September 2008.  There are several features of the decisions at end-September that can be criticised even allowing for the limited information then available to the decision makers.  The first was the guaranteeing of some of the subordinated debt.  Providing an explicit guarantee to subordinated debt holders is not only potentially costly to the State, but undermines the rationale for allowing banks to meet part of their regulatory capital with subordinated debt.  This was a definite design flaw in my opinion.  True, thanks to steps subsequently taken, the pay-out to subordinated debt holders of Anglo in the end was a small proportion of the total fiscal cost; however, that pay-out was not negligible.<\/p> <p>  The second was guaranteeing existing outstanding debt, namely, senior bonds and term deposits, was not necessary to underpin the banks' continuing access to funds.  Nor did the government guarantees introduced by other countries in 2008 offer any significant backward-looking protection in this way.  It is true that imposing losses on such bondholders would have had a damaging reputational effect on Ireland as a whole, as well as impacting local holders of such bonds; but that is a different question.  The decision to impose such losses could not have been lightly taken; but offering a pre-emptive guarantee on already outstanding or what I call \"old\" debt ahead of a full assessment of what it might cost was essentially gratuitous.  Furthermore, because much of this debt entitled the holders to immediate accelerated repayment in what is called \"an event of default\", the Government was effectively precluded from liquidating or extensively restructuring the guaranteed institutions because it would have to repay the guaranteed debt forthwith, which it would have been unable to do because of the sums being so large.  This effectively postponed the drastic restructuring action that was needed until the end of the initial guarantee period, by which time the Government's entry into the EU-IMF programme was actually imminent.<\/p> <p>  The third was failure to consult.  The Irish decision to provide a blanket guarantee without prior consultation triggered immense pressure for guarantees all over Europe.  Other governments resented the Irish action and this has made it difficult for the Government to make its case for burden sharing with Europe.<\/p><p>The fourth was the failure to seize immediate control over the management of Anglo Irish Bank.  It should be assumed that the existing management of a bank whose business model has lost the confidence of the market and which has run out of cash has neither the expertise nor the incentive to recover the situation safely.  The public authorities should have intervened immediately to take control of the bank, for which nationalisation was the available tool in Ireland.  Fortunately, nationalisation did follow in January 2009 without evident value destruction having taken place in the intervening period. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>How much does this matter?  Having made these criticisms, it is important to keep the scale in perspective.  The decisions on the night of the guarantee had consequences for Ireland but there has been a tendency to overstate the extent of the impact of that night's decisions on the subsequent welfare of the nation.  It would be hard to deny that most of the overall hardship that followed the bursting of the bubble was already inescapably embedded in the situation.  I will be put a number on this because quantification is important.  While it is not a precise figure, I would hazard that at least between 80% and 90% of the overall hardship was already inescapably embedded in the situation, albeit unbeknownst to the decision makers that night.<br\/><br\/>The damage had been made unavoidable by the unrestrained credit and property boom.  The fiscal austerity measures that had to be taken were not just due to the &euro;40 billion or so in additional net debt that can be linked to the guarantee, which I mentioned the last time I came before the committee, but also reflect the far larger impact of the ending of the construction boom on the Government's tax revenue and spending needs.  The fiscal costs are only one aspect of the total damage to Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In my letter to the inquiry of 12 February, I distinguished between a hypothetical hindsight scenario in which the Government would have been convincingly advised of the actual likely magnitude of the cost of a guarantee and the actual scenario with only the information available at the time.  In the actual case, the Government had no information at hand indicating that any of the banks were about to experience losses far in excess of their capital reserves.  What I have suggested as the best course of action, given the lack of such information in scenario 2, namely, buying time for negotiation with partners, seizing control over the two failing banks and limiting the scope of the guarantee, could hardly, unless the negotiations had proved remarkably successful, have reduced the direct fiscal bill by more than a few billion.  While this is not an insignificant sum, it is a fraction of the actual damage. <br\/><br\/>The alternative under the hindsight scenario of bailing in some of the bondholders and depositors of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS would have imposed additional disruption to economic activity and capital formation, which would have offset much of the savings to the State from not paying the creditors.  This point is made in the report of May 2010.  I conclude that the need for austerity measures - the scale of tax increases and expenditure reductions that have proved necessary since - could have been reduced somewhat but not all that much by anything done at the end of September 2008.  <br\/><br\/>It is important to maintain perspective and I would like to bring to your attention and call to mind some points of balance and perspective.  First, as I remarked recently in an article in a newspaper, the boom and bust both damaged our economy.  The boom and the decisions taken during it meant Ireland had to adjust down from living standards that could never have been sustained, with sizeable and capricious shifts in the distribution of wealth.<br\/><br\/>Second, the style of banking in Ireland, its regulation and broader economic policy were strongly influenced by comparable styles adopted at that time in countries often used as exemplars for Irish decision makers, in particular the United States and United Kingdom.  This was not a solo run but the scale of the excesses in Ireland put its banking crisis in a different league, although they were not as bad as in Iceland. <br\/><br\/>The third point of balance is that the extent and nature of the guarantee decision frustrated subsequent efforts to minimise the costs and speed the recovery.  However, the bulk of these costs could not have been avoided by a different course of action on the night of the guarantee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Honohan.

It is important that people are clear on that.<\/p> <p>  The legal opinion is that there are two particular legislative provisions that are very relevant here and give the Governor power to step into a situation which should be managed by the Financial Regulator.  When I refer to the Financial Regulator, I am not talking about one person but a whole section of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of the time.  Section 23 of the Central Bank Act 1971 is a very old provision.  In fact, I think it is a slightly modified version of the provision in the 1942 Act.  It is a general power to require banks or a particular bank to maintain specific ratios.  However, as it does not say what these ratios are, it means any ratios in principle.  This is a very wide and old-fashioned type of power, which effectively says, \"We trust you to establish ratios which are for the safe conduct of banking\".  These powers are embodied in the Central Bank board and delegated to the Governor.  They are, therefore, wide but general types of powers.  That is one thing he could have used.  He could have said, \"Look, the situation is very bad and I am going to appeal to the 1971 Act, intervene and require the banks to have a ration of not more than 20% of their assets in this type of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Could that include credit concentration limits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426032000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Yes, it could.<br\/><br\/>Turning the clock back ten years or so, the legal opinion in the Central Bank would have been that this was mainly used for the purpose of liquidity ratios and it was not ever used in a precautionary way for the balance sheet risks on the loan side.  It is clear, however, that the power was there.  <br\/><br\/>The members, as legislators, are aware that when one introduces new and very specific powers, it very often weakens the old, general powers because some bank might challenge them by saying, &quot;You are imposing this power under the 1971 Act but I cannot see why you are doing that because clearly the legislator has decided that there are some specific powers&quot;.  However, the advice is that those powers were there and could have been used. <br\/><br\/>The other provision gives the Governor, having regard to his European responsibilities in the European System of Central Banks or the board of the bank in relation to its objectives, particularly financial stability objectives, the power to issue guidelines to the Financial Regulator as to the principles and policies that it was required to implement in performing functions.  That is a different type of action.  I think that would have been the first course of action.  If the Governor felt he wanted to intervene and change the way the Financial Regulator was doing things, he would have probably used that guidance power, which would amount to a significant interference with the functioning of the Financial Regulator, before using the first power that I mentioned.  <br\/><br\/>I am saying this very much <i>ex post<\/i>.  People at the time never imagined the Governor doing these sorts of things, although it is mentioned in an analysis by the ECB, which was required to opine on central bank legislation.  The analysis highlighted the importance of this power but I believe it was thinking primarily of the power in connection with the European functions of the Governor and not in relation to concentration ratios or whatever. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Honohan.

First, as we said, it might be &euro;40 billion that was taken over.  The other losses to the Exchequer - the revenue losses and the other costs - were much larger than that so even if they had found a way, on 29 September, of saying, \"&euro;40 billion - magic it away to zero\" they would still have all those other losses of tax revenue.  The collapse of the property bubble created costs to the State which were much larger.  That does not mean the &euro;40 billion was not important.  It was.<\/p> <p>  Second, the hindsight scenario I outlined was that they would have decided they were not going to pay for this, that it was too big and certainly not worth &euro;35 billion or &euro;40 billion.  That would have had its costs as well because we know how disruptive it is to proceed to a liquidation and eventually to a bail in of depositors and bondholders, as we have seen in Cyprus.
