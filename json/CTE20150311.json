During our sessions this week, we will hear from a number of witnesses on the theme of relationships between state authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  Later this morning, we will hear from Professor Niamh Hardiman on systems of governance.  However, at our first session this morning, we will hear from Professor David Farrell, a professor of politics at UCD, to discuss the issue of public policy in parliamentary democracies.  He is a member of the Royal Irish Academy and a specialist in the study of parties, elections, electoral systems and Members of Parliament.  His current research focuses on the role of deliberation in constitutional reform processes.  In 2012, he was elected as president of the Political Studies Association of Ireland.  In 2013, he was elected as speaker of the council of the European Consortium for Political Research.  He is founding co-editor of the publication <i>Party Politics<\/i>.  Prior to his move to Dublin, he was professor and head of social sciences at the University of Manchester.  He is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As the witness has been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I invite Professor Farrell to make his opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#A00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426032000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak to the committee.  I have been invited to speak about the role of parliament in scrutinising government.  My paper has been circulated.  I propose to pick out some of the main features of the paper, if that is acceptable, and I will try to keep to time.  I apologise in advance if I inadvertently offend anyone in anything I say.  I am not a specialist in parliamentary procedure.  The members are and all of them know how this Parliament operates.  I am just an academic, a theoretician.  I have some knowledge of how the systems work in other countries, and that is the main reason I have been invited to contribute to the discussions.  If I make mistakes in what I say about the way in which the Oireachtas operates, I apologise.<\/p> <p>  In my comments, I want to observe a general consensus, which is that the Parliament in Ireland is weaker than in most other countries.  That is the context for my paper.  What I want to addresses is the question of whether this might have contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the banking crisis.  I have framed the note in two parts.  I want to start by giving some general ideas on what we might consider to be an \"effective parliamentary democracy\".  I will set out the three main features of an effective parliamentary democracy and then address each of them in regard to the Irish case.<\/p><p>Starting with an effective parliamentary democracy, we might reasonably expect it to consist of three factors.  First, the parliament should be organisationally and structurally suited to fulfilling its scrutiny role over government.  What I mean is that we should see some appropriate structure both in its plenary sessions and in its committee structures.  In terms of its plenary sessions, among the things one gets from the literature is that the parliament should be able to determine its own agenda, to varying degrees in collaboration with the government.  However, the parliament has a big say over its own agenda.  At the heart of this is a chair of the parliament who is elected by the Members of the parliament, MPs.  In virtually all of the other European cases it is by a secret ballot of the MPs.  Regarding the committee structure, one should see that the committees have a very major role in the legislative process.  That would include, among other things, sufficient time for committee work.  The features I pick out include the proportional allocation of chair positions among the parties; the election of the chairs by secret ballot of the members of the parliament; the notion that committee membership is not a right but a privilege; the notion of a well staffed and well resourced committee structure.  These would be the main features of what we might expect of a well structured parliament.<br\/><br\/>Second, it is one thing to think about the parliament having control over its own agenda, but if we are to see it also operating effectively we must also think about the culture of the parliament and how it is attuned to its role as a more equal player <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the government.  The second main factor of an effective parliamentary democracy is a culture of effective parliamentary scrutiny.  How this plays out in parliaments today, particularly in the last part of the last century and the first part of this century, is through its committee structure.  We should see an effective use of the committee structure as the core to this.  In those parliaments with effective committees there is a tendency for many of the members of those committees to take their committee role very seriously.  Some even see the committee as an alternative career route to ministerial office.  We see committees that follow a tight schedule of policy scrutiny, with meticulous attention to tracking the detail of the policy process, careful background research, well structured interviewing of witnesses and a philosophy of operation that specifically eschews ambulance chasing.<br\/><br\/>There is a third feature of an effective parliament.  One might have a parliament that is well structured and a parliament whose members take their role very seriously, but the third link in the chain is a culture of open and transparent government.  This obviously relates to a robust freedom of information regime, whistleblower legislation and the like.  However, it also relates to how the government interfaces with parliament.  The government and its agencies must be prepared to work with parliament in providing access to information and to key officials.  Of particular relevance to the work of this committee, I would argue, is an open budgetary process and the right for parliamentarians to quiz heads of agencies and senior civil servants on policy and operational matters.<br\/><br\/>Those are the three main features of an effective parliamentary democracy.  How does the Irish Parliament relate to that?  As I said earlier, the first point relates to the strength of the parliament.  The consensus among academics is that the Irish Parliament is one of the weakest in Europe.  It is not just the academics who say it, the politicians also say it.  Look at what happened in the most recent election in 2011.  Every political party represented here put parliamentary reform very high on the agenda in their manifestos, so it is clear that the politicians think this.  A key feature of the programme for Government of this Government is a commitment to deal with parliamentary reform.  D&aacute;il reform was also a topic that was taken up by the Constitutional Convention as one of the agenda items it chose to examine.<br\/><br\/>It is the weakness of the Oireachtas that explains why so little attention is paid to it in the three reports we have had to date on the banking crisis.  Having read through the three reports in preparation for my presentation today, I was struck by the absence of attention to the Oireachtas.  The only thing I could find was in the most recent, 2011, commission of investigation report which says, in passing, that one of the causes of a systemic financial crisis is likely to include a parliament that remains unaware of the mounting problems.  That is the only reference I could find to the Oireachtas.  Given the recent flurry of interest in D&aacute;il reform, it would be nice to think that this issue has been resolved.  There is not too much evidence that the issue of a weak D&aacute;il has been resolved to this date, and I will be happy to discuss that matter in further detail during the questions and answers.<br\/><br\/>The second feature is the question of whether there has been sufficient scrutiny by the Oireachtas.  It is one thing to talk about the weakness of the Oireachtas, which I have just outlined, but it is quite another to see to what extent the Oireachtas has been making use of its existing powers.  As I outline in my document, committees already have quite substantial powers.  I list them on page 4.  The question is whether the committees were prepared to make sufficient use of those powers to test the veracity of the Government and other regulatory offices that were suggesting things were fine in the lead-up to the banking crisis.  The second point is the lack of scrutiny by the Oireachtas and whether a culture shift is required by the Oireachtas to address that.<br\/><br\/>The third feature of an effective parliamentary democracy is open government.  That relates to active engagement by the government with the parliament of the day, or Oireachtas in this case.  As I set out in my report, as a Westminster democracy we follow what is found in Westminster democracies.  First, there is a very tightly controlled, highly secretive budgetary process with a fixation on budgetary secrecy.  That question was meant to be addressed.  In the programme for Government in 2011 the Government talked about how it could open up the budget process to the full glare of public scrutiny.  We have yet to see that.<br\/><br\/>The second feature in the open government agenda is the issue of the ability to question senior civil servants.  The protocol followed in this country is that the Minister's word is final.  Any advice that might have been provided in conflict with the decision of a Minister is not divulged, and certainly not divulged to the Parliament.  In a context in which we know now, from the reports, that there were differences of opinion between Government Departments over the direction of economic policy leading up to the banking crisis, it should be possible for a senior civil servant to provide additional information to an Oireachtas committee on the different scenarios that might have been explored in the lead up to a decision.  Arguably, it should even be permissible for a civil servant to inform the committee of areas where he or she may have been in disagreement with their Minister.  That issue was raised in the Labour Party manifesto of 2011 and was included in the programme for Government: &quot;Restrictions on the nature and extent of evidence by civil servants to Oireachtas committees will be scrapped, and replaced with new guidelines for civil servants that reflect the reality of authority delegated to them, and their personal accountability for the way it is exercised&quot;.  I would hazard the argument that we get to see that.<br\/><br\/>In my main conclusion, what I draw from all of this in the period under scrutiny is that the Irish Parliament performed poorly.  It lacked sufficient organisational and structural fire power to provide effective scrutiny.  It lacked the political will to use what powers it did have, indicating what I call cultural shortcomings, and it was hindered by a governmental system that places great emphasis on secrecy, particularly in its dealings regarding budgetary matters.  There is little evidence to this day that those matters have been resolved.  My overall argument is that if the Parliament has sinned in any regard relating to the origins of the banking inquiry, it is more in respect of sins of omission than sins of commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you.

It is only by way of a fundamental overhaul that a cultural shift might be realised.  If only one or two things are changed, the culture of how the process operates will not change.  There is a need to change how the whole system operates.  In effect, I am suggesting issues such as what it is that motivates a Member of Parliament to be an active member of a committee need to be examined.  There is no doubt that this committee is a model of good practice and that its members take their role very seriously, for understandable reasons, given the subject matter of its deliberations.  Having appeared before and observed other committees, I argue that, in comparison with committees I have observed in other countries, there is a need for reflection on how committee work in this system is done.  While it is largely about changing the structures, it is also about changing how members treat their committee role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Pearse Doherty, in his written opening statement and oral commentary to the committee Professor Farrell said the failures of parliamentary practice in terms of oversight were more sins of omission.

There has been much talk about D&aacute;il reform, but we have yet to see serious D&aacute;il reform.  With the singular exception of pre-legislative scrutiny, there has not been serious engagement by this or previous Governments with D&aacute;il reform.  What many of us have been arguing for in terms of parliamentary reform - as I set out in passing in part of my paper - is a secretly elected Ceann Comhairle and a clear agenda for root and branch reform of how the D&aacute;il operates, with an equivalent exercise being undertaken in the Seanad at the same time.  There is a need to look at how the D&aacute;il can have a much greater say in setting its own agenda and the allocation of its own resources, with other reforms relating to how committees are formed, including the notion that committee membership is more a privilege than a right.  It should be the case, perhaps, that a Member would be appointed to no more than one committee and that committee work is viewed as a serious part of a Member's parliamentary work.  There should be committee weeks in order that committee members would have the scope to get on with their committee work, quite apart from any other legislative work.  There should be proper resourcing of committees and proper resourcing of the parliamentary function rather than the resourcing of individual parliamentarians.  I could go on, but these are the sorts of thing that have been mentioned and bandied about and on which we have yet to see any serious engagement.

They have a parliamentary role to play and should be serviced in that role.  If we were starting with a blank sheet, what I would be advising - others would agree with me on this - is that resources should be given to committees.  I can see that this committee is well resourced, but that should be the norm rather than the exception.  The library and information service should be better resourced than is the case.

That is one of the abiding features of the consensus parliaments of continental Europe - a coalition accommodating an inclusive notion of government.  A coalition government is comprised of several parties, hence the need to co-operate and work well.  There is also a notion that at any given time one party might be in or out of government.

If we were to go down the road of having committee members able to speak the unspeakable across party lines, and even vote across party lines on committee reports, with the understanding it might still go back to plenary and there would still be the possibility of the Government saving the day if it was particularly worried about its legislation, at least it would start to instil the notion that individual parliamentarians have their own voices and are able to think their own thoughts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Professor Farrell mentioned the powers committees already have.

Professor Hardiman is associate professor of political science and public policy.  She has studied at UCD and Nuffield College, Oxford, and worked for a time at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.  For several years, she was a fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, where she was the tutor in politics before moving to the school of politics and international relations in UCD, where she is director of graduate studies and director of the interdisciplinary public policy programme.  Her research interests centre on the political economy and public policy.  She is interested in the politics underlying policy outcomes, the politics of how public policy priorities are formed and implemented, the implications of institutional design for good governance and the political economy of growth, distribution and redistribution.  Among her recent papers are work on comparative fiscal responses to crises, methodological challenges arising from analysis of fiscal policy choices, the political economy of housing bubbles, new approaches to thinking about the European periphery, the effects of crisis on State structures, the implications of State structures for vulnerability to crisis and the fiscal foundations of the State.  Professor Hardiman is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>Before I begin, I wish to advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As she has been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I have been invited to talk about governance practice in Ireland.  I think that the broad outlines of the banking crisis are familiar enough.  We know that the banks borrowed too much, they made too many risky loans and too little heed was taken of the growing property price bubble.  So, from a political science perspective, some of the key weaknesses that stand out for me are, first, there was too little oversight and accountability going on in the Irish political system.  The banks, we now know, were too lightly regulated, but in political life, too, the powers of Parliament to scrutinise policy were, in my view, too limited.  There was not enough accountability for things that go wrong, so it was often hard to learn the right lessons for the next time, or even better so there would not be a next time.<\/p> <p>  Second, politicians and key public officials in some respects may have had too little distance from powerful private sector interests.  Third, there was too much consensus over policy priorities and critical views were marginalised.  There was too little specialised knowledge in the public service and there was a resistance to using expertise effectively.  Each of these features of the political system is in conflict with principles of good governance.  I would like to sketch in some of the institutional weaknesses that made these kinds of problem possible.<\/p> <p>  For a political scientist, institutions are important because institutions that work well are crucial for good political outcomes.  They create the framework for people's interactions with one another.  That is what an institution is.  However, even good institutions can end up being run badly or operating badly, so there is always a need to have appropriate incentives to keep good standards of conduct going.<\/p> <p>  When we are thinking about good governance, there is not actually any single agreed definition.  It is always something that is under debate, but there is an influential contribution to this debate developed by the Quality of Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, which says that good governance depends on what it calls the impartiality of institutions that exercise government authority.  In this sense, there are two aspects of impartiality in the way that the State relates to its citizens.  One concerns what I might say is the input side of things, that is, who gets access to public authority.  The principle here is that privileged groups should not be able to gain preferential access to decision making in ways that would distort considerations of public interest.  The other side of things is what I might call the output side of things, the outputs of political decision making, that is, the way political authority is exercised.  This means that procedural rules and guidelines should always be respected and no individual or group should be either favoured or discriminated against.<\/p> <p>  So far, so good.  We might say \"relatively uncontroversial\", because these formal principles are well represented in Irish public life, but if we think about the Irish experience, we can see that there are a number of weaknesses in institutional design and in actual political practices.  I want to identify three areas that correspond with the three sets of problem that I mentioned just a moment ago.  These are about, first of all, political oversight and accountability; second, the relationships between political actors and private interests; and, third, the contestation of ideas.<\/p> <p>  First, thinking about political oversight and accountability, governments have to manage public affairs, but policy also needs to be challenged and government needs to be held to account.  We have a power dimension, one might say, of the exercise of public power and also a legitimacy dimension.  It is more difficult in Ireland than elsewhere to scrutinise and amend legislative proposals and more difficult to hold the Government to account.<\/p><p>I believe this was the subject of discussions the committee held with Professor David Farrell in the last session.  His, and other research, indicates that the Irish Legislature is still a bit of an outlier in comparative perspective on these indicators.  Accountability within the public service is also a problem.  We are not always good at learning from mistakes when things go wrong in the public service.  Too often we are inclined to say that the system is to blame and we leave it at that.  All this is in the process of change at the moment.  The Civil Service renewal plans are aimed at reforming the ways the Civil Service functions and includes procedures to improve and strengthen accountability.  This is all very much a work in progress.  <\/p><p>  My second point is about privileged access to decision making.  There should be distance in the relationship between private interests and public authority in both input and output.  We know there were close relationships between banks, builders, developers and political leaders during the years of the boom.  This is potentially a problem on the input side of things.  It may present a problem for Government's ability to take a measured view of its policy options or to establish enough distance and aggregate all the preferences it is exposed to in a public interest perspective.  We have legislation on standards in public office, regulation of political donations and freedom of information legislation, all of which really do help to reduce the incidence of inappropriate access and influence - but poor practices may be harder to control or eliminate.  Our ethics legislation dates from 1995 and 2001 and I do not think many people would suggest there were no problems at all in the years that followed.  Making sure that legislation has the desired effect may not be quite so straightforward.  <\/p><p>  One way of having strong accountability in other European countries involves the strong role of parliamentary committees, but this is an area where there have been some weaknesses.  When we think of regulation in the financial sector there is also a gap between what the formal rules say and the way informal practices actually play out.  The powers that were available to the financial regulator before the crash were, as I understand, not excessively weak, but enforcing an effective regulatory regime is another matter.  The Irish form of light touch regulation was never going to get full disclosure of risks and liabilities on the part of the financial institutions.  Ireland was not the only country to commit taxpayers' money to providing guarantees to the financial sector, but there are a couple of things that stand out about the Irish experience.  Policymakers had fairly limited access to any kind of accurate information about the true state of the banks before the guarantee was extended.  This is a problem which goes back well beyond 2008.  It is a clear failure of the regulatory regime.  <\/p><p>  Although large guarantees were extended in other countries, they did not necessarily have to put them into practice.  The difference lies in the organisation of the banking sector itself and the links they had with each other.  Denmark for example committed 259% of GDP to guaranteeing its banks and Ireland committed 232% - similar orders of magnitude.  While the Danish taxpayers were eventually liable for something like 1% of GDP, in 2012 it was estimated that the direct cost of the guarantee to the State was around &euro;64 billion, which is 41% of GDP.  It seems that the Government in Denmark was able to negotiate a sector wide rescue scheme which involved a lot of participation by the financial industry itself.<\/p><p>  I am not saying that the Danish experience is directly translatable to Ireland, there are many problems in trying to translate practices from one country to another, but what it does illuminate is that the Government seemed to have very little insight into what was going on until it was too late.  As one analyst said it was \"torn between denial and panic\" when it was too late to do anything other than step into the breach with large guarantees. One might well think that in a small country like Ireland it is quite difficult to maintain appropriate distance between the regulator and those who are regulated, or between the powerful, wealthy business interests and the politicians.  Many of these people come from similar backgrounds.  They went to the same schools and may even be related to one another.  All of this plays a role in lowering the boundaries between the personal and the official political roles.  However, Denmark is also very small and socially interlinked.  Institutions need to be well designed and appropriate incentives and sanctions should encourage good practices to try to avoid the worst happening in the first place.  This involves informal practices as well as the formal rules and sanctions.<\/p><p>  My third point is about groupthink and critical evaluation, groupthink meaning when critical judgment is not properly exercised.  Peoples' opinions converge on what is perceived as general wisdom without subjecting it to too much criticism.   Many people have commented on the scale of groupthink during the boom and this was clearly a problem, not just in the case of bank risk, but in macroeconomic policy more generally.  Ireland was far from unique in this naive faith in the self regulating market and the ideas that property prices were going to rise forever, there was going to be a soft landing and that this time is different.  This time is never different.  However, at the same time there were dissenting voices - people sounding the necessary warnings.  There were those who were uneasy about bank risk and the sustainability of the property boom.  Sometimes these people may have lacked the confidence to speak out too loudly, but there were enough who raised their doubts and their warnings.  For the most part they were criticised or even ridiculed.  The question now is how to create a space for those people who offer an alternative point of view, even though it is unpopular, so they get taken seriously and that countervailing opinion gets factored into the discussions, perspectives and anticipations?<\/p><p>  Among the safeguards against groupthink in public life there has to be: high quality information available; a public service that can use the information well; practices such as having open environment for debate; critical engagement with different points of view in different fora; and encouragement of contestation over ideas in the policy process.  Open debate is the basis for informed analysis and good policy formation.  Developing the policy capacity of the public service was not very high on the list of political priorities during the boom.  Indeed, during those years there was a proliferation of new agencies.  Why were they created?  It was because often it was easier to do new things by adding on new skills outside the existing public bureaucracy.  We now have a lot of State agencies and there is a clear rationale for many of them.  Agencies which operate at arms length from Government can serve a valuable purpose.  In other cases one might have expected these new positions to be created inside Government departments themselves but instead we have this agency proliferation.  In 2008 the OECD commented, not favourably, on what it called the \"organisational zoo\" of Irish State agencies. <\/p><p>  Good policy making also needs access to good technical skills of all sorts and these are improving now.  We have the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, but there are other areas where there are skills and competence deficits.  There have been questions, for example, about the management skills of the senior civil service.  Reform is under way in these areas, but it is still very much a work in progress.  We want the public service to act as a guardian of the public interest.  To do this it needs to maintain a culture of independence from political influence.  In formal terms that is well established in Ireland, but we sometimes hear it said that some senior civil servants may be less willing now than in the past to challenge Government ministers' points of view.  There may be a number of reasons for this.  In other countries, when a government is in power for a long period of time, civil servants may be more likely to align themselves with Government preferences.  The way we organise career promotions may encourage anticipatory adjustments.  It may be that civil servants are under a lot of day-to-day pressure to protect their Minister from criticism and from bad publicity in what is an intensely media saturated policy process.<\/p><p>Until quite recently, if individuals wanted to expose things that have gone wrong they could expect very little protection.  We now have The Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  That goes a good way towards remedying this, both in the private and the in the public sectors.  Here again if we want the legislation to have the effect that we want more is likely to be needed.  There has to be a culture of encouraging critical engagement.  The most effective way of doing this is to develop an environment in which debate and disagreement is normal, where discussion is not shut down too quickly in the interests of getting a decision, where people do not feel that their right to speak out is determined by their place in the hierarchy.  <br\/><br\/>Critical analysis is exactly what universities do.  We engage in information, research, evidence and so on.  Some progress has been made in engaging the universities in critical debate about public policy and public sector reform, but I think more could usefully be done.  We can also think about the role that civil society organisations may play, an active role as watchdogs over the public interest, over regulatory and other bodies.<br\/><br\/>Inside the banks themselves we can now see that there were weaknesses in corporate governance to do with this phenomenon of group think.  Banks engaged in very risky lending practices not least because their own shareholders put pressure on the directors to match the performance of the most profitable institutions, which were also the most risky.  No bank can grow its profits at the extraordinary rates that we saw during the boom, in a safe manner.  The brakes were off inside the high street banks too in terms of internal vigilance.  It might be useful in this regard to think about the differences in the governance of the Irish and the Canadian banking sectors.  The Canadian banks did not suffer systemic crisis this time around.  One contrast between the two systems is the fact that the Canadian financial regulator played a very strong role.  Bank directors expected rigorous and even painful scrutiny by the regulator and they internalised that expectation in the way that they conducted their own directorial responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>Inside the banks, the way the banks functioned also shows some interesting differences.  As I understand it, directors can influence board decisions and bank outcomes through very much the same sort of practice that I mentioned a moment ago, good information, good preparation, an ability to ask hard and unexpected questions, a willingness to be critical and challenging towards management and to hold them to account effectively.  In Canada, some of the corporate practices provided a stronger framework than may have been in existence in Ireland for encouraging these behaviours.  For example, Canadian directors often, it seems, hold <i>in camera<\/i>sessions without management present.  This lets them test ideas and build support among colleagues.  This seems to have helped the non-executive directors to avoid excessive deference towards managers and it strengthened the independent and challenging voices on corporate boards.  <br\/><br\/>In conclusion and in summary, I think what I have been focusing on is this feature of good governance centring on the idea of impartiality.  Good institutional design is vital, but so too are the practices that make institutions work effectively.  In the Irish case, this has implications in three areas that I have outlined.  My first point was about political accountability.  I noticed a relatively weak capacity to subject the Executive to scrutiny.  Improving accountability is still in its early stages. The second point is about the relationship between private interests and public office holders and this needs to be constantly monitored.  My third point is about the risk of group think and this persists as long as there is too little respect for informed critical opinion, too little willingness to look for high quality information and too little openness to debating and contesting ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Niamh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Hardiman for her opening statement.

Ireland and Britain stand out as having particularly weakly developed powers available to the legislature.  This is usually measured in terms of the powers and competences available to parliamentary committees, powers of compellability of witnesses, powers to command papers, but also agenda setting of the work of the parliament itself, the time-tabling within committees, the ability to get amendments accepted inside committees, the degree to which committees work along party political lines, the ending of debate and the guillotining of debates in committees.  All those indicators suggest that in Ireland and Britain the parliamentary committees have a weaker scope of powers available to them.  Many continental European countries have stronger powers.  The strongest of all are in Scandinavian countries, it seems, and in the Netherlands where committees have extensive powers to set agendas and so on.<br\/><br\/>To what degree is this influenced by the electoral system?  There is extensive debate about the Irish electoral system and electoral system reform is the first answer whenever anything goes wrong.  I am not so convinced.  Practices and expectations might not necessarily be changed by having, for example, a list PR system.  One of the things that is encouraged in continental European systems by having a list system, is the ability to prioritise getting people elected on account of their policy competence but there is a price to be paid for that and that is that they get onto party lists without necessarily having to have a very close association with their constituency base, with their electorate.  I do not have to tell that to people here.  You are all elected politicians.  You know much better than I do what it takes to get elected.The very strong features of the Irish electoral system are that it enables a strong connection with the local electoral base and to have a strong sense of responsiveness to civil society.

In the context of the banking crisis things did go wrong in the banking sector before.  There was a financial sector collapse in 1984 and I wonder if the right sort of lessons were learnt about risk that can happen inside financial institutions and the sort of oversight that may be required at that point.  We know, for example, that Pat Gallagher was subject to criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland and many commentators have asked why that was or why these were not pursued in the Republic.<\/p><p>I do not know the answer to that question.

During the 1990s growth in productivity and adding new resources to the economy were generating a strong export performance and a strong performance in traded services.  After 2000 there was a shift towards investment in capital stock, most of which was going into construction, especially housing.  There are many reasons for this.  The Irish population was growing and there was a housing shortage; perhaps the early indicators of the housing bubble that were first explored in the late 1990s did not necessarily see the full magnitude of what was coming along.  The context had changed a great deal, of course.  By 1999-2000 we were living in the eurozone and very cheap credit was available.  We now see the fiscal incentives to facilitate additional economic activity in the area of construction were misplaced in terms of generating a long-term sustainable growth model.  They were also unwise in a context where it was becoming very much cheaper to borrow and use money in the banking sector.

As there is very little scope for evening out the economic cycle, corrective measures are introduced at a time when they are most difficult.  One of the corrective measures is the type of thing that has been put in place in recent years in the form of the Fiscal Advisory Council, to have an independent advisory body to provide information and expert and informed commentary on Government spending plans.  It would not stop the Government.  Irish Ministers for Finance have a tremendous amount of discretion when it comes to devising and implementing fiscal policy.  The good side of that is that when a quick turn around in policy is needed, as we saw in response to the crisis, Irish Governments, in the context that they have good networked governance in the wider society, which we can discuss as well, have the capacity to make policy and implement it quite well through a very effective public administration system.  They can turn around quite quickly.  The balance side of it is that if disadvantageous or perhaps unwise fiscal policy is being pursued, there is very little friction in the system.  There are very few institutional breaks.

Among the principles of good regulation are two essentials, the first of which is expertise.  It is important to ensure the regulatory system has strong expertise in the area it is trying to oversee because regulators are there to stop people from doing things they want to do.  When people want to do things, they will try to find ways around the rules.  Recently in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>, for example, Gillian Tett commented on the fact that the stress tests for American banks were possibly too lenient even still because the regulatory system was imposing stress tests that were too predictable.

They were of the view that, in the absence of a transfer union, a banking union, debt resolution and all of the things we have now learned as so important, it would prove somewhat problematic.  Maintaining an independent exchange rate regime was very challenging for Ireland at the time.  On the whole, compliance with the requirements to join EMU worked well for Irish economic performance in terms of the policy process.  In the early stages, most people expected that upside would be very strong and that integration with the wider European economy would be facilitated by the single currency, that trade would improve, that our export links with other eurozone countries would be intensified and so on.  Adaptation to the new policy regime, whereby there was no control over exchange rates and monetary policy, was probably slow in coming because it attached new importance to the domestic capacity to manage by using just cost-containing mechanisms, fiscal policy, etc.  What people did not realise was all the perverse incentives that would spill out from having such low interest rates.<\/p><p>That was a shock that was genuinely hard to manage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#Y01900","nonspeaker":"Professor Niamh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The new, ethical and open complex that the professor has described to us sounds most interesting.

At the time I am speaking about, some banks were growing profits at a rate that most expert commentators would have thought to be unwise.  There would have been a question about the riskiness of the business model they had been pursuing.  If there was nothing illegal about what they were doing and if they were not constrained by regulation from what they were doing, there was nothing in essence to stop them other than what their own internal audit or risk management might have suggested.<\/p> <p>  My observation is about the pressure this puts on other financial institutions that are also responsive to their own shareholders.  When an economy is in this exuberant state, people expect their investments to yield a good return.  My comment is that people should be sceptical about the durability of the business model that their money is tied up in.  The economist, Hyman Minsky, is often cited nowadays because a long time ago he developed a model whereby he predicted that crashes were inevitable, that financial crises will recur and will happen for different reasons next time, but they will happen.  They can be worse or less damaging, but they will be driven by the acceleration of expectations that there is money to be made.

In my letter of 12 February, I sought to clarify parts of my evidence to the inquiry on 15 January.  I have prepared these short introductory remarks on the presumption that the inquiry has invited me back on this occasion to amplify my views on the alternative courses of action that might have been taken by the Government at the end of September 2008.  Perhaps I should recall explicitly that I myself had no involvement in the guarantee decision, so my views are based on what I learnt from preparing my May 2010 Report on Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy, as well as on many conversations with other experts and on my general knowledge of banking crises in other countries.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a critique of the decisions of end-September 2008.  There are several features of the decisions at end-September that can be criticised even allowing for the limited information then available to the decision makers.  The first was the guaranteeing of some of the subordinated debt.  Providing an explicit guarantee to subordinated debt holders is not only potentially costly to the State, but undermines the rationale for allowing banks to meet part of their regulatory capital with subordinated debt.  This was a definite design flaw in my opinion.  True, thanks to steps subsequently taken, the pay-out to subordinated debt holders of Anglo in the end was a small proportion of the total fiscal cost; however, that pay-out was not negligible.<\/p> <p>  The second was guaranteeing existing outstanding debt, namely, senior bonds and term deposits, was not necessary to underpin the banks' continuing access to funds.  Nor did the government guarantees introduced by other countries in 2008 offer any significant backward-looking protection in this way.  It is true that imposing losses on such bondholders would have had a damaging reputational effect on Ireland as a whole, as well as impacting local holders of such bonds; but that is a different question.  The decision to impose such losses could not have been lightly taken; but offering a pre-emptive guarantee on already outstanding or what I call \"old\" debt ahead of a full assessment of what it might cost was essentially gratuitous.  Furthermore, because much of this debt entitled the holders to immediate accelerated repayment in what is called \"an event of default\", the Government was effectively precluded from liquidating or extensively restructuring the guaranteed institutions because it would have to repay the guaranteed debt forthwith, which it would have been unable to do because of the sums being so large.  This effectively postponed the drastic restructuring action that was needed until the end of the initial guarantee period, by which time the Government's entry into the EU-IMF programme was actually imminent.<\/p> <p>  The third was failure to consult.  The Irish decision to provide a blanket guarantee without prior consultation triggered immense pressure for guarantees all over Europe.  Other governments resented the Irish action and this has made it difficult for the Government to make its case for burden sharing with Europe.<\/p><p>The fourth was the failure to seize immediate control over the management of Anglo Irish Bank.  It should be assumed that the existing management of a bank whose business model has lost the confidence of the market and which has run out of cash has neither the expertise nor the incentive to recover the situation safely.  The public authorities should have intervened immediately to take control of the bank, for which nationalisation was the available tool in Ireland.  Fortunately, nationalisation did follow in January 2009 without evident value destruction having taken place in the intervening period. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>How much does this matter?  Having made these criticisms, it is important to keep the scale in perspective.  The decisions on the night of the guarantee had consequences for Ireland but there has been a tendency to overstate the extent of the impact of that night's decisions on the subsequent welfare of the nation.  It would be hard to deny that most of the overall hardship that followed the bursting of the bubble was already inescapably embedded in the situation.  I will be put a number on this because quantification is important.  While it is not a precise figure, I would hazard that at least between 80% and 90% of the overall hardship was already inescapably embedded in the situation, albeit unbeknownst to the decision makers that night.<br\/><br\/>The damage had been made unavoidable by the unrestrained credit and property boom.  The fiscal austerity measures that had to be taken were not just due to the &euro;40 billion or so in additional net debt that can be linked to the guarantee, which I mentioned the last time I came before the committee, but also reflect the far larger impact of the ending of the construction boom on the Government's tax revenue and spending needs.  The fiscal costs are only one aspect of the total damage to Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In my letter to the inquiry of 12 February, I distinguished between a hypothetical hindsight scenario in which the Government would have been convincingly advised of the actual likely magnitude of the cost of a guarantee and the actual scenario with only the information available at the time.  In the actual case, the Government had no information at hand indicating that any of the banks were about to experience losses far in excess of their capital reserves.  What I have suggested as the best course of action, given the lack of such information in scenario 2, namely, buying time for negotiation with partners, seizing control over the two failing banks and limiting the scope of the guarantee, could hardly, unless the negotiations had proved remarkably successful, have reduced the direct fiscal bill by more than a few billion.  While this is not an insignificant sum, it is a fraction of the actual damage. <br\/><br\/>The alternative under the hindsight scenario of bailing in some of the bondholders and depositors of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS would have imposed additional disruption to economic activity and capital formation, which would have offset much of the savings to the State from not paying the creditors.  This point is made in the report of May 2010.  I conclude that the need for austerity measures - the scale of tax increases and expenditure reductions that have proved necessary since - could have been reduced somewhat but not all that much by anything done at the end of September 2008.  <br\/><br\/>It is important to maintain perspective and I would like to bring to your attention and call to mind some points of balance and perspective.  First, as I remarked recently in an article in a newspaper, the boom and bust both damaged our economy.  The boom and the decisions taken during it meant Ireland had to adjust down from living standards that could never have been sustained, with sizeable and capricious shifts in the distribution of wealth.<br\/><br\/>Second, the style of banking in Ireland, its regulation and broader economic policy were strongly influenced by comparable styles adopted at that time in countries often used as exemplars for Irish decision makers, in particular the United States and United Kingdom.  This was not a solo run but the scale of the excesses in Ireland put its banking crisis in a different league, although they were not as bad as in Iceland. <br\/><br\/>The third point of balance is that the extent and nature of the guarantee decision frustrated subsequent efforts to minimise the costs and speed the recovery.  However, the bulk of these costs could not have been avoided by a different course of action on the night of the guarantee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Honohan.

It is important that people are clear on that.<\/p> <p>  The legal opinion is that there are two particular legislative provisions that are very relevant here and give the Governor power to step into a situation which should be managed by the Financial Regulator.  When I refer to the Financial Regulator, I am not talking about one person but a whole section of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of the time.  Section 23 of the Central Bank Act 1971 is a very old provision.  In fact, I think it is a slightly modified version of the provision in the 1942 Act.  It is a general power to require banks or a particular bank to maintain specific ratios.  However, as it does not say what these ratios are, it means any ratios in principle.  This is a very wide and old-fashioned type of power, which effectively says, \"We trust you to establish ratios which are for the safe conduct of banking\".  These powers are embodied in the Central Bank board and delegated to the Governor.  They are, therefore, wide but general types of powers.  That is one thing he could have used.  He could have said, \"Look, the situation is very bad and I am going to appeal to the 1971 Act, intervene and require the banks to have a ration of not more than 20% of their assets in this type of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Could that include credit concentration limits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426032000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Yes, it could.<br\/><br\/>Turning the clock back ten years or so, the legal opinion in the Central Bank would have been that this was mainly used for the purpose of liquidity ratios and it was not ever used in a precautionary way for the balance sheet risks on the loan side.  It is clear, however, that the power was there.  <br\/><br\/>The members, as legislators, are aware that when one introduces new and very specific powers, it very often weakens the old, general powers because some bank might challenge them by saying, &quot;You are imposing this power under the 1971 Act but I cannot see why you are doing that because clearly the legislator has decided that there are some specific powers&quot;.  However, the advice is that those powers were there and could have been used. <br\/><br\/>The other provision gives the Governor, having regard to his European responsibilities in the European System of Central Banks or the board of the bank in relation to its objectives, particularly financial stability objectives, the power to issue guidelines to the Financial Regulator as to the principles and policies that it was required to implement in performing functions.  That is a different type of action.  I think that would have been the first course of action.  If the Governor felt he wanted to intervene and change the way the Financial Regulator was doing things, he would have probably used that guidance power, which would amount to a significant interference with the functioning of the Financial Regulator, before using the first power that I mentioned.  <br\/><br\/>I am saying this very much <i>ex post<\/i>.  People at the time never imagined the Governor doing these sorts of things, although it is mentioned in an analysis by the ECB, which was required to opine on central bank legislation.  The analysis highlighted the importance of this power but I believe it was thinking primarily of the power in connection with the European functions of the Governor and not in relation to concentration ratios or whatever. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Honohan.

First, as we said, it might be &euro;40 billion that was taken over.  The other losses to the Exchequer - the revenue losses and the other costs - were much larger than that so even if they had found a way, on 29 September, of saying, \"&euro;40 billion - magic it away to zero\" they would still have all those other losses of tax revenue.  The collapse of the property bubble created costs to the State which were much larger.  That does not mean the &euro;40 billion was not important.  It was.<\/p> <p>  Second, the hindsight scenario I outlined was that they would have decided they were not going to pay for this, that it was too big and certainly not worth &euro;35 billion or &euro;40 billion.  That would have had its costs as well because we know how disruptive it is to proceed to a liquidation and eventually to a bail in of depositors and bondholders, as we have seen in Cyprus.

I am Pat Davitt, the chief executive of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers &amp;amp; Valuers, IPAV, and I am here with our National President, Mr. Keith Anderson, who is also a practising auctioneer.<\/p> <p>   Our institute is the representative body for almost 1,000 auctioneers throughout the country.  It was set up in 1971 and it is the only institute catering solely for the professional and educational requirements of auctioneers and valuers throughout Ireland.  IPAV places a strong focus on professional education and runs a series of higher level courses in collaboration with the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, which is approved by the National Property Services Regulatory Authority for auctioneering licence purposes.  We also provide opportunities for auctioneers to develop their studies to degree level 7 and 8 in the College of Estate Management, Reading, in the United Kingdom. <\/p> <p>   The institute works with Government Departments and other arms of the State in advancing issues of policy relevant to the auctioneering profession.  We have actively promoted throughout the years the European Valuation Standards, blue book, believing them to be the highest quality standards.  They have now been accepted by the European Central Bank as its favoured valuation standards throughout Europe. <\/p> <p>   Given our reach into every town in Ireland our members form a central part of the local business community serving those buying and selling properties locally and also further afield. <\/p> <p>   The background to the research which the committee has kindly invited us to share with it today came about as a result of concerns expressed by our members about the growing length of time the conveyancing process was taking in Ireland.  We surveyed members in January 2015 and more than 200 members responded to a series of ten questions.  I believe all members of the committee have a copy of the study and no doubt they will have of questions for us.  Therefore at this juncture I will not go through it line by line.  Rather, IPAV President, Mr. Keith Anderson, who has played a lead role in the research, will take members through some of the highlights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I would like to say at the outset that solicitors, whom we work with on an ongoing basis, for the most part do a fine job for purchasers and sellers alike.  However, there are severe inefficiencies within the system as currently operated.  Our study was aimed at getting some measure of what is happening and from there to work with all interests to try to address deficiencies in the systems.  <\/p> <p>   Our research found that over 60% of auctioneers said they were experiencing unwarranted delays from the time a sale is agreed to close of sale.  Almost 37% said they had experienced such delays sometimes and a mere 3.7% said they were not experiencing unwarranted delays.  Members were then asked the most common reasons for such delays.  There are two main reasons.  The major reason for such delays was solicitors' conveyancing procedures, and these were identified as a reason by an overwhelming 79% of respondents.  Coming in second place was policy procedures at lending institutions, and these were identified as a reason by over 45% of respondents.  When it came to the length of time from sale agreed to a close of sale it was on average almost four months in 2013, and that extended to four and a half months in 2014.  Members were asked to give a view on whether delays were attributable to a reluctance on the part of solicitors to do business by e-mail or telephone, instead favouring the traditional method of letter writing.  Over seven in every ten agreed that this was the case.  The remaining 30% were asked for their views and the reasons they gave were greater caution in signing off documents in recent times, high levels of due diligence required, and inefficiencies.  <\/p> <p>   There is no getting away from the fact that very serious consequences arise from delays in conveyancing.  In our study, 68%, or seven in ten auctioneers, have lost sales, and over 27% have experienced banks withdrawing finance.  What is happening here is that against a backdrop of financial pressure consumers are trying to make plans for the future.  They research the market for a suitable property, and in many urban areas that is not easy to find at the moment.  When they eventually find a property within their budget they make an offer.  In many cases they wait in trepidation to see if they will be outbid.  It is a moment of joy when they are told that their offer has been accepted and the property goes sale agreed.  At this point it should be only a matter of a short few weeks before they take full possession and start a new phase in their lives but that is not how it happens for many.  Purchasers and sellers are coming back to us week after week frustrated with a lack of progress after the sale is agreed.  Many move on and try to buy another property, with the added time and expense involved.  In a recovering property market some are worried that if they do not succeed in buying the home they want prices may rise beyond what they can afford.  It is a very unsatisfactory situation for both buyers and sellers.  Delays in conveyancing are not within the control of the auctioneering profession yet our members' reputations are being tarnished in their own communities as a result of delays in conveyancing which lead directly to gazumping.<\/p> <p>  In conjunction with our study we asked our colleagues in the European Real Estate Confederation, CEI, and the European Council of Real Estate Professions, CEPI, about their experiences.  The results which are set out at the back of the document that the committee has contrast sharply with the Irish experience.  Across Europe lawyers conduct a great deal of real estate business via e-mail and telephone and the majority of sales are closed within 30 to 60 days.  As our CEO, Mr. Pat Davitt, said, I am a practising auctioneer and I see these problems first-hand every week.  I have to deal with frustrated consumers who are trying to do nothing more than secure a home for themselves and their families. <\/p> <p>   At this point I will hand back briefly to our chief executive, Mr. Pat Davitt, who will outline our proposals to the committee for addressing the issues identified in our research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#B00250","nonspeaker":"Mr. Keith Anderson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Auctioneers, like solicitors, are represented in every town in Ireland and they, like us, are an important part of that community.  These serious delays in conveyancing are not good for property buyers and sellers, and commonly lead to gazumping.  They are not good for auctioneers and ultimately they are not good for solicitors either.  Our President, Mr. Anderson, has outlined some of the impediments for solicitors.  We also appreciate that many solicitors' offices are under pressure arising from the fallout of the financial crisis.  Some will have been forced to let staff go and some are not in a position yet to ramp up again.<\/p> <p>   In residential investment property sales there is now an added layer of legal involved.  The buyer, if purchasing with a mortgage, now has to pay for the bank's solicitor as well as their own.  The seller pays their own solicitor.  So there are now three different solicitors involved in this transaction.  This is a far cry from the practices operated and enjoyed by our European neighbours, as our survey points out.  We ask this committee to look into this with a view to changing this practice.  If banks are not happy with using the purchaser's solicitor to certify title we propose that they set up a panel of solicitors from which purchasers could choose one.  This would dispense with the need for an additional solicitor and would cut weeks off the timeframe from sale agreed to close of sale.  This is done very successfully with valuation panels; the valuation on the property is a very important part of the transaction.  We fail to see why this would not work.  After all, while consumers pay the bills and the mortgage, the bank holds the deeds and it is in their interest to make sure that the job is done correctly. <\/p> <p>   Interestingly, section 7(3) of the new SI 47 of 2015 from the Central Bank, Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Housing Loan Requirements) Regulations 2015, which deals with the new loan-to-value, LTV, and loan-to-income ratios, LTI, states: \"A lender shall ensure that the appraiser appointed by that lender shall undertake a market valuation of a residential property which is required under these Regulations not earlier than a period of two months before the date on which the advance under the housing loan is made by the lender.\"  Therefore, if conveyancing goes beyond that two-month deadline a new valuation will have to be sought by the financial institution.  If the new valuation comes in lower than the original one, and the loan is for the maximum of 80% LTV allowed under the Central Bank new rules this will throw all the bank loan documents out of sync.  New loan documents will have to be drafted, further delaying the process. <\/p> <p>   In Construction 2020, recommendation 73 states: \"In collaboration with key stakeholders (the legal profession and the banking sector) we will review and report on the steps required to deliver a system of e-conveyancing in Ireland, including the resource implications and timeframes for delivery.\"  At a recent meeting with the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland it confirmed that it is very supportive of an e-conveyancing system.  We have sought a meeting with the Law Society with a view to attaining its assistance in addressing the situation. <\/p> <p>   As public representatives we ask the members of the committee to support a fast-tracking of State plans for the e-conveyancing system.  The Property Registration Authority has been set up and it has recently indicated that e-conveyancing could be up and running in two and a half years.  This, in our view, is far too long and far too far away.  With banks increasingly offloading more properties the current situation is likely to be exacerbated.<\/p><p>The property price register sales figures for 2014 show that 40,000 properties changed hands.  This is a turnover of between 2% and 2.5%.  However, a normal functioning property market would be expected to turn over 4% of all possible stock.  If this number of properties had to be conveyed it would most likely exacerbate the current problems.  The electronic stamping system was set up in 2009 by the Revenue Commissioners with great success.  Its success could be replicated with e-conveyancing.  We would ask that the committee would do everything within its powers to speed it up.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman.  We would be happy to take any questions you may wish to put to us. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for his presentation.

From my limited experience, and the Chairman is around a lot longer than I am, I suggest that the witness set up a formalised working group and put together various sectoral interests campaigning for e-conveyancing.  It has a far better chance of progressing with the auctioneers and the Law Society and others involved.  I believe it requires this because while the Government would agree with the principle, it has a lot of other more pressing priorities.  If the Government was dealing with an umbrella group of sectoral interests the campaign would have a better chance of progressing quicker.<\/p> <p>   My other point concerns the area of gazumping.  No disrespect to the two witnesses, but auctioneers have been as responsible as anybody else for gazumping and for some of the behaviour which ended up creating and causing gazumping, particularly during the Celtic tiger period.  Would it be the view of witnesses that gazumping should be illegal and that legislation should be introduced to prevent it, as exists in other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#C00800","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Of course as an auctioneers' representative I am going to tell you that auctioneers never take part in gazumping.  It is quite easy to see why we do not take part.  Gazumping happens when a purchaser who did not get to buy a property, makes a further higher offer on the property.  Since 2012 it is against the law to not pass a bid on to a vendor if it is made after the property goes sale agreed and before the actual contracts are signed.  If I sell a property today, it goes sale agreed.  If someone else then makes a higher offer the next day or a week later, I have to go back to the vendor.  If I do not go back to the vendor, that vendor can complain to the regulatory authority and I could lose my licence.  The moral of the story is that auctioneers do not like gazumping, it is not good for us and we do not want it to be practised.<\/p> <p>   I was on the 2004 committee when the Property Services Regulatory Authority started.  I proposed there should be a sales contract for auctioneers so when we do a sale we should be able to take out a sales contract, complete it with the vendor and the purchaser and then sign it with both parties so there could be no gazumping after that.  That sales contract would put a stop to it but it would be subject to a contract completed by the Law Society or by a solicitor, a formal contract completed after that sales contract was done.  We do not like the practice, but we have to take part in it because it is the law.  We cannot do anything else only take part in it if someone makes us an offer.  Everyone is entitled to buy a property until such time as the contracts are signed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":746,"content":"<p>There are rogue auctioneers the same as there are rogue solicitors and everything else, but I do admire the tenacity of the witnesses' defence of his profession.

Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone in 1876 and to this day solicitors will not use the telephone, nor will they use e-mail.  They will write to clients.  It takes a week to write a letter and week to come back.  That is the most frustrating aspect.  There is a need to get around the table and sort things out in plain language.

Having received my warrant of appointment from the President last month, I welcome the fact that my first appearance before the Oireachtas in my capacity as Ombudsman for Children is to discuss the role and functions of the office.<\/p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children's office is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.  The office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  The one that is perhaps most familiar to the committee is the function to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children.  In carrying out this function, the office observes the fundamental principles of an ombudsman, namely, it is independent and impartial, it is neither an advocate for the complainant nor an adversary to the public body, it seeks at all times to promote the swift resolution of complaints at a local level, where possible, and it aims to achieve systemic change through its investigatory work by tackling the root causes of the complaints we receive.<\/p> <p>  However, the investigatory mandate set out in the Ombudsman for Children Act also contains a number of distinct elements derived from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, namely, the obligation to have regard to the best interests of the child and give due consideration to the wishes of the child when investigating a complaint.  My office has developed considerable expertise with respect to engaging directly with children, some of whom are very young, when examining the cases that come to us.  This aspect of accessibility has been identified by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as an essential component of the work of an ombudsman for children.<\/p><p>My office saw a significant rise in the number of complaints received in 2013 with 16% more complaints received than in 2012 and a 28% increase from 2010.  The majority of complaints are in relation to education, 43% in 2013, and a significant proportion of complaints received also relate to family support, care and protection issues, 26% in 2013.  The vast majority of complaints, 75% in 2013, are brought by parents on behalf of their children.<\/p><p>  While we work continuously to provide a high standard of service, the increasing volume and complexity of complaints is placing significant demands on our capacity to respond and I have submitted a business case to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs regarding additional resources to carry out our tasks.  I take this opportunity to commend all my staff for their efforts in this regard and must acknowledge that it has put immense pressure on the whole office.  <\/p><p>The complaints received range in levels of complexity and the issues raised are often of the most serious nature including complaints about the handling of child protection concerns, services and supports for children in care, access to education, resource allocation for children with special needs, and access to suitable housing.  The information gained through examination and investigation of complaints allows my office the opportunity to address the situation for individual children and also to look at systemic change that will improve how the public body interacts with all children and families. <\/p><p>  A dominant feature of investigations, with few exceptions, is that they highlight a lack of awareness about the impact of public administrative decision making on the lives and rights of children and their families.  Decision making that affects children directly and sometimes indirectly is often not informed by its impact on the children concerned, nor is it informed by children's rights principles.  The procedures, and in some cases those applying them, are not aware of or sensitive to the needs or rights of children or their families or the relationship between timely decision making and good administration.  At times, individual children can be largely invisible and decision making can be excessively bureaucratic and lacking in flexibility to meet the individual needs of children.  There appears to be few checks and balances in administrative decision-making processes and few mechanisms for challenging the decision or the position adopted. <\/p><p>  In addition to examining and investigating complaints, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is mandated to promote and monitor the rights of all children in Ireland.  The Oireachtas conferred a range of functions on the Ombudsman for Children under section 7 of the Act to carry out this complementary role.  These functions include advising the Government and the Oireachtas on law and policy affecting children; advising Ministers of the Government on the development and coordination of policy affecting children; promoting awareness of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including among young people; and engaging directly with children and young people to highlight issues relating to their rights that are of concern to children themselves.<\/p><p>  The different functions of the office inform and support each other.  Work undertaken in accordance with one particular statutory function may trigger complementary work under a different function.  Similarly, where there is an obstacle to tackling children's rights issues due to an exclusion to the OCO's investigatory remit, for example, we can use another function to address the problem.  An example of this concerns young people in detention.  Members of the committee may recall that prior to 2012, the Ombudsman for Children was excluded from investigating complaints from young people in prison.  In the absence of being able to receive complaints, the OCO used its statutory function to engage directly with children and young people in order to undertake a consultation with the young people detained in St. Patrick's Institution.  The purpose of this work was to give the young people in question the opportunity to highlight concerns they had regarding the institution and put forward concrete suggestions on how their situation might be improved.  My intention in setting out this example is to demonstrate that a broad mandate that blends different functions can offer a range of options to address children's rights issues.  This is a very important aspect of the strong and robust mandate that the Oireachtas has given my office.<\/p><p>  Although that mandate is strong and robust, every year since its establishment in 2004, the Ombudsman for Children's Office has identified areas in which the Ombudsman for Children Act can be further strengthened.  Of particular note in connection to this is that the Ombudsman for Children Act obliges me to monitor and review generally the operation of the Act itself and to make recommendations to the Government and to the Oireachtas for amending that legislation.  In March 2012, the OCO submitted its first review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act to the Oireachtas, in accordance with that statutory function.  The review was informed by the OCO's own experience, international best practice, and the recommendations made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to the State when it last examined Ireland in 2006.  The report prepared by the office was supplemented by concrete suggestions for amending the Act in the form of a draft Ombudsman for Children (Amendment) Bill.  I am glad to report that many of the changes sought by the OCO in its review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act were achieved through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  In particular, a number of public bodies previously excluded from the investigatory remit of the office, such as the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, became reviewable agencies.  <\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to record my office's appreciation for the efforts of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in facilitating and supporting these amendments to the Ombudsman for Children Act.  Nonetheless, a number of issues remain outstanding.  I will now set out the principal matters that are in need of further attention.<\/p><p>  The independence of my office should be enhanced.  Independence has a number of dimensions but one of the most important is having adequate resources to discharge the functions given to the office by the Oireachtas and being free from any potential political pressure that could be applied through changes to the office's financial resources.  At present, the OCO receives its funding through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In practical terms, the control of the OCO's budget by the Department has not proven to be problematic.  However, it is inappropriate for an independent human rights institution to receive its funding through a public body that it can investigate.  I believe that the situation should be remedied by providing for the OCO's funding to come directly from the Oireachtas.  This was also a recommendation made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  That UN committee will certainly raise the question once again when it examines Ireland in January 2016 regarding its compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p><p>  My office&rsquo;s investigatory remit is not as extensive as it should be.  The committee is well acquainted with the need for appropriate, independent complaint handling for protection applicants, including those currently residing in the direct provision centres.  The long-standing position of my office is that the current exclusion to the investigatory remit of the office in relation to the administration of the law regarding asylum and immigration relates only to decisions on status.  My office believes everything else, including issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaint handling, are in remit.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality does not share this understanding.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has recommended that the Oireachtas put the matter beyond doubt and provide clear, unambiguous access for protection applicants to my office.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for its attention this afternoon.  I have only had the opportunity to sketch out a number of issues in general terms.  I am happy to address any queries the committee may have in regard to them or to other aspects of my role and functions as Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426089600,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his presentation.  In relation to the issue of legal professional privilege it is most helpful that Dr. Muldoon is before us here today.  I am particularly mindful of the March 2012 report by the then ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, and it was on the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  Section 4 of that report deals with investigation of complaints procedure and access to information.  I know Dr. Muldoon does not have the report before him but I draw his attention to points 4.2 and 4.3, which state:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>An issue that has arisen in this context is access to documents in respect of which public bodies claim legal professional privilege.  It is not uncommon for this office to have difficulty obtaining documents germane to an investigation due to a claim of such privilege.  This can give rise to serious concerns if, as has been the experience of ombudsmen in other jurisdictions, such an approach is adopted primarily to frustrate an investigation.<\/blockquote>It then goes on to say:<blockquote>This is not to call into question the importance of legal professional privilege as such.  It is to advocate for its proper use.  Understanding decision-making by public bodies is the core of the Ombudsman for Children's investigation and there are instances in which much may turn on the legal advice received by a public body.  The purpose of obtaining and considering such documentation is to see what light it can cast on the administrative actions of the public body.  It should be emphasised that this relates to legal advice received by an organisation under investigation and not any given individual.<\/blockquote>I note from that report how the Australian federal ombudsman is empowered by section 9 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 to obtain such information.  How much of an issue is this for Dr. Muldoon as a new ombudsman coming in?  How does his office find or suspect that the claiming of legal professional privilege is adopted primarily to frustrate an investigation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#C00150","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426089600,"counter":815,"content":"<p>As can be seen from the 2012 report it has been an issue across the office.  It is not widespread but certainly it has happened on occasion and we have been able to negotiate our way around it up to now but we would like to put it beyond doubt.  The key role of any ombudsman is to find out how a decision was made and why people came to that decision to generate a certain action within a public body.  If legal advice guides them in a certain direction it is important that we have that access to that legal advice.  We also point out that anything that comes to our attention through an investigatory remit is confidential and so there is no issue in that regard.<\/p><p>There are no issues in this regard.

I wish to ask about the position of children in families being pushed through homeless services or having housing difficulties.  Is this a significant feature of the complaints the Ombudsman for Children receives or a general concern of his?  If it is not I strongly urge him to look at it because the situation is dire.<\/p> <p>  Many families with children, often with disabilities and special needs, arrive to local authority offices facing homelessness and are told there is nothing for them and to sleep in the car for the weekend, or they are placed in completely unsuitable environments such as hotels or emergency hostel accommodation with people with drug problems.  This week I spoke to a young woman with two young special needs children who was placed in a hotel.  After she walked through the door, she was offered heroin by the first person she met, in front of her children.  This is where the local authority put her.  It is absolutely unacceptable for children to be in this environment.  Does the Ombudsman for Children receive many complaints in this area?  Does he have concerns about it?  If so, is he making his views known?  Should I encourage people to make complaints to the Ombudsman for Children about the situation, because it needs to be dealt with urgently?<\/p> <p>  I am also greatly concerned about youth mental health services.  Does the Ombudsman for Children receive many complaints in this area and is he concerned?  The situation in this regard is also dire.  There is a lack of beds for young people with mental health problems, often who are self-harming and possibly suicidal.

My colleague, Ms O'Shea, led the investigation.  We looked at young people aged 16 or 17 coming out of the care system and getting lost and finding themselves homeless.  Over the past year or two we have found this has completely changed and the type of people becoming homeless are a different entity.<\/p><p>As the Deputy pointed out, it now affects young families who previously would have survived within the rental accommodation scheme.

I am interested in learning more about how Dr. Muldoon views his role in advising Government on policy.  We often discuss the issue of child poverty and the immediate reaction is that it is not something we want to happening.  However, we know the reality for some families.  Based on Dr. Muldoon's advisory role, is there anything in particular about Government policy that should be altered, whether in a minor or a major way, to eradicate child poverty?  I accept that is a somewhat general question.<\/p> <p>  All of us would agree that it is dreadful to have child poverty in our midst.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about the issue of homelessness and how that might enter into the equation but in certain parts of the country homelessness is not happening.<\/p><p>I am not saying that there are no difficulties with housing, but they are not to such extremes.  Anecdotally and from my dealings with families, I have often been struck by how families get the same resources from the State, such as welfare and so on, even when there is child poverty, for example, children are not brought to school on time or to medical appointments.  This would add to poverty and to poor outcomes for children, be they education, health or other outcomes.<\/p><p> This relates to another matter.  Resources and money are given.  I will call the former \"money\" as well.  We often refer to money, but it is needed to address child poverty.  I am asking the witnesses and saying something at the same time; these are just thoughts.  Is it not correct that child poverty is a complex issue?  The family's ability to support a child goes beyond the financial.  Beyond what  may term the \"political speak\" of \"child poverty\" and \"we must\", how does Government policy measure up against the policies of countries that we consider progressive?  Would the witnesses suggest any action as a particularly good one for the Government to take?

I am new to this role and have not examined the legislation in that way yet, but my initial thoughts would be that there is already an understanding of child poverty.  We have many top class agencies and individuals, including in Departments, who understand how child poverty is happening.  It is still increasing.  As far as I can tell, what is on the ground and the ability to resource are at issue.  There are many programmes, for example, the breakfast clubs run by Barnardos.  As Deputy Mulherin mentioned, funding is going to certain areas but is not necessarily being used in the best way.  No more than in the case of mental health, support needs to be given to each of these areas.  The supports and legislation have been designed, but there is not enough follow-through to prevent child poverty.  One needs to start at the earliest possible point to help a family back onto its feet and learn how to assist its children in attending school and how to provide the best possible opportunities.  We have those systems in place, but it may be a lack of resources that is the difficulty.  It is not my place to comment on where those resources should come from or go and I do not know whether legislation would help the child poverty scenario, but there are opportunities to use what is already in place, make it better and allow those families to gather the supports we have designed and access them properly and in a coherent way, which has not been the case heretofore.<\/p> <p>  The eradication of child poverty is, as the Deputy mentioned, a large task.

I am accompanied by Mr. Hugh Creegan, director of transport investment and taxi regulation at the National Transport Authority, NTA.<br\/><br\/>One the primary functions of the authority is to secure the provision of public bus passenger transport services across the State.  Public bus passenger services are provided in three forms.  The first relates to commercial public bus passenger services which are licensed by the authority under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  These services are not in receipt of a State subsidy but are available to the public.  Examples include Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services, Aircoach, Citilink, etc.  It is important to note that commercial bus service variations are entirely at the discretion of the service provider.  There is no legislative provision to enable the authority to refuse an amendment to services unless we consider the change will impact on other services locally.  Second, public bus passenger services which have a public service obligation, PSO, are provided throughout Ireland under contract to the authority, primarily by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  These services are in receipt of a State subsidy.  Third, public bus passenger services in rural areas are provided under the rural transport programme.  Many of these services are demand-responsive services, that is, the route can be varied to pick up customers.  These services are in receipt of a State subsidy.<br\/><br\/>In 2009, the authority entered into public service contracts which incorporate public service obligations with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A further direct award contract was granted to Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2014 for five years.  The new contracts contain higher performance standards for the services supplied by each operator with regard to the reliability, punctuality and quality of services provided.  The Act and the contracts allow for changes to be made to the contracts - unilaterally by the authority if necessary - to amend the specifics of the public service obligation network of services provided, the performance obligations specified and the reporting and monitoring arrangements.  Any proposed changes by the operators to the services are subject to approval by the authority before they can be implemented.<br\/><br\/>The authority is now managing the rural transport programme on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and is in contract with a large number of operators across the State providing transport services in remote rural areas.  These services are managed by the transport co-ordination units across the country as the authority's agents.  This allows the authority to examine all public bus passenger services together to ensure that the greatest coverage and efficiency is achieved across the country for the subsidies that are being paid for those services.<br\/><br\/>The authority has undertaken service reviews in a number of regions throughout the country and has implemented many changes in partnership with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In the regional cities, these changes have resulted in growth in passenger numbers and revenue in Cork and Galway in particular.  Further amendments have been made in Sligo and in the Dublin commuter belt with changes to PSO services in Kerry and Mayo being planned for implementation shortly<br\/><br\/>The licensing of commercial public bus passenger services is controlled by the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 Act.  These bus services are those that are available to members of the public on a commercial basis, that is, they do not receive any compensation from the State.  The statutory guidelines for the licensing of public bus passenger services explain how bus licence applications and amendments will be handled and the criteria under which they will be assessed in order to serve the transport customer and enable competition within a structured framework.  The guidelines are available on the authority&rsquo;s website at <i>www.nationaltransport.ie<\/i>.  Examples of commercially licensed bus services include those provided by Aircoach, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway services, Citilink, Matthews and Swords Express among others.<br\/><br\/>The economic climate over the past number of years has been challenging for passenger transport companies generally as they have been experiencing falling passenger demand resulting in reduced revenues while simultaneously experiencing increases in costs.  These conditions have begun to change with a better economic outlook, improved passenger journeys and a significant reduction in the price of oil now on the horizon.  The improvement in road infrastructure between major towns and cities has had a variety of impacts.  Car journey times between town and cities have fallen substantially and this has posed a challenge for the public transport alternatives.  A number of operators have reacted by taking greater advantage of the improved road infrastructure to reduce their journey times and offer more direct services.  This has resulted in a more attractive offer for end-to-end travellers.  However, it has also meant that some operators have sought to withdraw from locations along the route so as to keep journey times short or because the level of demand at these locations is low.<br\/><br\/>The licensing system manages the commercial responses of operators to ensure that a more comprehensive and better public transport service is created for citizens through the issuing of licences alongside the contracted and subsidised services.  This is achieved by examining services in an integrated timetable to maximise service coverage.  There is nothing to prevent any licensed operator from applying to the authority to amend the times and-or routings of commercial services.  Such amendments are considered in accordance with essentially the same criteria used for issuing licences.  Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s branded Expressway services fall into this category.  There is also nothing to prevent an operator from terminating a licensed service at any time for their own business reasons.  However, where an amendment proposal relating to a commercial service would have no impact on any other commercial or subsidised service, the current legislative provisions require the authority to grant that service amendment even if it considers that it would adversely impact the area served.  This reflects the fact that these licences are for commercial services where the operator is taking all the financial risk.  <br\/><br\/>We are acutely aware of significant concerns at the loss of certain commercial services in rural towns and villages.  In particular, the largest commercial operator, Bus &Eacute;ireann, has sought and been granted amendments to its Expressway licences throughout the country and in particular on the route 5, Wexford-Dublin, and route 7, Cork-Clonmel-Dublin services.  JJ Kavanagh through its Avalen and Kenneally companies has also sought and been granted amendments to its licences on the Waterford to Dublin corridor, which has resulted in a significant reduction in services in some towns along that route and some towns with no services.<br\/><br\/>The authority is now faced with finding some way to fill gaps in public transport at a time when the available subsidies may not be sufficient to meet the public need despite having stabilised this year after many years of reduction.  We are actively examining the re-configuration of nearby PSO services and also the services provided under the rural transport programme as an in-fill option but these possibilities all have to be within the budgets that are available.<\/p><p>We will procure services if the gaps cannot be filled by reconfiguring existing subsidised services, subject to the funding being made available.  Tender documents are being prepared in parallel to reduce the delivery time for any new services.  A working group of representatives of all the communities affected along route 7 has been set up.  The authority will actively engage with that group on any proposed replacement services.  The replacement services for route 5 have been finalised and the local representatives will be briefed in the next week on those proposals.<\/p><p> The authority is obliged to complete a review of Part 2 of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 on the licensing of public bus passenger services and related guidelines this year.  We will be seeking both the public and key stakeholders&rsquo; views prior to reporting to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p> The provision of public bus passenger services in a dynamic environment is challenging.  The authority is best placed to review all existing services and to provide an integrated bus and rail services more effectively throughout the State.  We remain committed to ensuring that State subsidies are deployed to optimal effect across the country to maintain as many services as possible and to plan for growth in those services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":871,"content":"<p>Before inviting Mr. Martin Nolan from Bus &Eacute;ireann to make his opening presentation, I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Michael Warnock-Smith from the National Transport Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":872,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to discuss the company&rsquo;s recent changes to certain interregional Expressway routes.  I am accompanied by the chairman of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Mr. Aidan Murphy, and one of our regional managers, Mr. David Lane.<br\/><br\/>As the company&rsquo;s business structure may appear complex due to the integrated network it provides, I would like to clarify the position of Expressway <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the other services we provide.  While our integrated network provides great benefit to rural communities, the company must account financially for each product on an individual basis.  Funds generated by the PSO remain within the PSO network.  Any surplus arising on school transport is ring-fenced for reinvestment in the school transport scheme and Expressway can only access funds it has generated itself.  While the company will report a surplus for 2014, Expressway itself earned less than &euro;500,000 for the year.  While this result represents a significant improvement on previous years, it still leaves much work to be done to make the product financially viable.<br\/><br\/>Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s overall strategy is focused on providing safe, value-for-money and customer centred transport services to urban and rural communities in an effective and efficient manner across three main product areas.  First, we continue to work in partnership with the National Transport Authority to negotiate and deliver the best possible public transport offering for PSO services provided under direct award contract outside the Dublin metropolitan area.  Work programmes are focused on passenger and capacity growth on the core network as the economy recovers, supported by fleet replacement, facilities and infrastructure investment.  Second, we are delivering further cost savings and efficiencies in the provision of school transport services on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Third, we continue to develop the commercial interregional Expressway brand along with network improvements for faster journey times and more competitive fares.  Despite the recent changes, Expressway continues to play a vital role in connecting local transport networks to urban centres across the country without receipt of PSO subvention. <br\/><br\/>In his presentation to this committee last July, our chairman, Mr. Aidan Murphy, pointed out that Bus &Eacute;ireann has been in survival mode in recent years.  The company worked its way out of the recession but we are conscious that there will be a restricted Exchequer purse for the foreseeable future.  Bus &Eacute;ireann remains committed to working with its stakeholders to deliver the best transport system possible in an efficient and effective manner given the funds available.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has unfortunately been required to make hard decisions to ensure financial sustainability.  We have delivered on all of our commitments to the NTA, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Education and Skills.  The ingredients for a sustainable public transport system are being delivered. <br\/><br\/>In respect of PSO services provided under contract to the NTA, we are focused on identifying the range and level of public transport services required outside the Dublin metropolitan area over the period of the five year contract to 2019.  It should be noted that as the PSO subvention has been significantly cut in recent years, the scope for maintaining local public transport services out of the existing PSO payment has been eliminated.  For the avoidance of doubt, members will appreciate that the contract with the NTA does not in any way include Expressway services.  We do not receive any PSO payment from the NTA for the delivery of our Expressway services.  These services comprise 23 interregional routes that operate across the country, linking cities and population hubs and now served by our distinctive large red and silver coaches.  Expressway must generate its own funds for investment in new coaches to survive in the long term.<br\/><br\/>I will now outline the changes that we have implemented on our commercial Expressway services over the last few years, the latest of which relate to routes 5 and  7.  The changes that we have made on Expressway services in recent years are due to competitive pressures brought about by the increased availability of commercial licences, locations being bypassed by motorways and the changing needs of our customers.  The vast majority of our Expressway customers want faster interregional journeys between the main population concentrations, where possible using the motorway.  I previously shared our concerns about the impact of the motorways on smaller towns and villages with Oireachtas committees in 2008, 2009 and 2012.  I also advised that changes to a number of our commercial Expressway intercity routes were required to ensure their survival and to protect local jobs given the increasing liberalisation of the market and what I would call cherry-picking of routes by private operators.  Nothing has changed in this regard.  Competition on Expressway routes has increased since 2012 and, unfortunately, most of what we predicted has come to pass.  As a company, if we do not make changes required by customers, Expressway will go out of business and jobs will be lost both within Bus &Eacute;ireann and among the wide range of suppliers that depend on Bus &Eacute;ireann across the country.  We cannot trade recklessly.  Expressway has to make a commercial return on its routes to enable fleet replacement because it does not receive any funding for buses or coaches on these routes.<br\/><br\/>In the past, and as part of the social dividend we returned to the State, we provided Expressway connections to many of the secondary locations that have now been bypassed as a result of the expanding motorway network.  With the increased level of licensing for direct services to and from the main population concentrations, our ability to service many of these secondary locations in a sustainable manner has been eliminated.  Since the legal changes to our roles introduced in 2009, the NTA is ultimately responsible for the transport solution for the towns affected by our recent decisions on routes 7 and 5.  The NTA's role is to determine the most efficient public transport alternative.  Funding is obviously integral to any decision it makes.  We will continue to work with the NTA to inform its decisions and we will bring our own proposals to the table.<br\/><br\/>As part of the Expressway turnaround programme in recent years, our Expressway services have had to come out of about 17% of secondary locations.  However, in most cases an alternative public transport connection exists or was made available.  Overall, there has been no widespread loss of services to rural locations as a result of the decisions we have to make, despite what some commentators have tried to suggest.  In this regard, I underline our steadfast commitment to serving rural Ireland.  As the biggest provider of rural transport in the country, almost 10,000 people help to deliver our services every day.  These people work and live throughout the towns and villages of Ireland, with their wage packets contributing to the sustenance of local economies.  We are proud and dedicated in our commitment to rural Ireland and to the provision of jobs and services in these communities.  I would like to emphasise this point given our heritage of transport service which dates back now to the 1930s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for presenting a clear picture of the role of the NTA and Expressway as a commercial service.

They are real communities and not that far from Castlecomer, County Kilkenny.  Castlecomer would have been the central point for communities living in these areas to access services.  They are real communities.  I find it extraordinary that Bus &Eacute;ireann states it is not prepared to reveal plans to withdraw services from rural areas such as these because of commercial sensitivities.  The main problem is that most people see Bus &Eacute;ireann and CIE as public service vehicles.  Its representatives may try to explain that they have a commercial non-subsidised service, but people simply see a bus that has been providing a service since the 1930s.  They find it impossible to comprehend a decision can be made without local consultation.  I pay tribute to a colleague, Councillor Pat Fitzpatrick from outside Castlecomer, who was the first person to find this out.  The chances are, as Mr. Nolan says, that he found out through some of the staff.  The rumours were then picked up by the <i>Kilkenny People<\/i>and local media and the campaign to seek clarification and retain the services started.  The same happened with the route through Bunclody and Wicklow where Councillor Barbara-Anne Murphy repeatedly tried to make contact with Mr. Nolan's office and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Eventually, some response was received.<\/p><p>The role of the NTA is crucial.  If, as we are hearing, Bus &Eacute;ireann must wash its face with the Expressway routes and will progressively withdraw services from rural towns and villages, there must be a social role the NTA should fill.  It is rather interesting that in both presentations today there were regular references to matters being subject to finance or a lack of finance.  Therefore, the question is what is the role of the Government and the Department.  Do the delegaes agree that there is a need for increased resources to ensure that when there is a withdrawal of services from rural Ireland, alternatives are put in place?  I would like them to clarify the position on route 7 out of Bunclody.  My understanding is that it does not currently operate on any motorway.  Bus &Eacute;ireann made the point that, as part of its social dividend, it provided Expressway connections to many of the secondary locations which have now been bypassed on foot of the expanding motorway network.  That might be clarified as I understand route 7 does not run along a motorway.  It provides a service for students and people attending hospital appointments and doing various other things.  What are they going to do now that the service has been withdrawn?<\/p><p>Perhaps this is a question I should direct to Ms Graham and the NTA.  What are the NTA's plans in this matter?  It states, in relation to route 7, that a working group of representatives has been established.  That is a positive development, but it should not result in hundreds of people turning up at public meetings once the news starts to break in a local community.  More than 200 people came out in Bunclody, more than 300 in Castlecomer and more than 200 in Athy.  These are people who will be adversely affected by the withdrawal of services.  What is the role of the NTA in this context?  What services is it going to provide to meet the needs of rural communities?  It states it will shortly engage actively with the group, that a replacement service has been finalised and that local representatives will be briefed in the next week on the proposals to be made.<\/p><p>Does it see a role for the extension of licences to private operators under the PSO to provide feeder services to larger communities?  Even if they were to use minibuses or small buses, that might prove viable.  <\/p><p> What is the funding mechanism for access for those with travel passes?  I understand the Department of Social Protection withdrew funding for services on PSO routes and that if it does negotiate with the NTA for a licence to operate such a service, the operator cannot pick up passengers with travel passes.  Will the delegates clarify this because I have not been able to obtain a clear answer from the Department?  How is the subsidy spent and is it true that a private operator granted a licence will not be allowed to pick up passengers with travel passes?  When one considers the demographics in rural Ireland, where there is a large number of elderly people, that seems to be counter-productive.<\/p><p> What will Mr. Nolan do about the withdrawal of services?  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann see itself as having any obligation whatsoever to provide alternative services, or is it just the case that it will operate end to end between large centres and effectively cut out the rest of rural Ireland of any transport service alternative?  Is it its role to address this, or is it the role of the NTA and, ultimately, the Government?  Is it a question of resources?  If Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA had enough money from the Exchequer, would they be able to provide alternative services in those rural areas where services are being withdrawn?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#E00700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":882,"content":"<p>To start with the question about resources, we have a current budget assigned for PSO services that has been fully allocated to our existing contracts.

We will put our proposals to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to assist us.  If we had more funding, we could provide more services.

To what does it amount?  To follow on from Senator Paschal Mooney's question, children in the Dublin metropolitan area can travel to school on Dublin Bus, DART and mainline rail services.  Why is it the case in rural Ireland that there can be four, if not five, public service buses on the same roads, on the same days and practically at the same times?  Why can children living in rural areas not travel to school on a bus bringing a pensioner to the local town?  The HSE operates a transport service, while the rural transport service is also in operation.  In some instances, two buses pull in to the side of the road at the same time to collect two people.

We have spoken at this committee before about how, as an authority, we are trying to integrate rural transport services with HSE services.  The restructuring of the rural transport programme which now has 17 transport co-ordination units is providing the framework for the integration of the HSE and rural transport programme services to have more effective service provision.  We are working to eliminate scenarios such as the one described by the Deputy, where two buses pull in at the same location.  That is not an effective use of public transport.

The bottom line here is that there is a public responsibility to give equal transport access to everybody in this country.  I wonder if we have a lack of communication and co-ordination at the moment between the National Transport Authority, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the private operators and rural community transport.  We need to maximise the benefits on a cost-benefit basis for provision of services to everybody.  There may be a need for a national review and an evaluation of where we are going.  It appears to be a bit haphazard at the moment.  We have to fair to everybody.  An excellent service is being provided by the community transport companies, which they have developed over a number of years.  They have targeted remote areas that would normally be deprived of services.  Is there a plan for co-ordinating with and feeding into the higher levels of transport, like the expressways, from the smaller communities on to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann?<\/p> <p>  What marketing and public relations work is being done for all the services?  We cannot forget our tourism product.  The tourism industry in peripheral areas such as the west and south west, where we probably have the most tourists outside Dublin, should be given a quality service.  Tourism is expected to be up 10% in 2014 and may go up again in 2015.  We need to move forward in a well-devised fashion to ensure there is good connectivity and communication with our peripheral areas.  We have a lot to work on.  The witnesses may need to be sitting around a table more often and planning their strategy properly because, as I said, there is an obligation to give everyone an equal service.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of local issues, for example, a bus going from Tralee to Ballydavid, west of Dingle, one of the greatest visitor areas in the country.  It is scheduled to go into Ballydavid village but is not doing so.  I ask that this be rectified immediately as it is depriving the local consumers as well as visitors coming into the area.  There are rumours that the Killarney to Rathmore service may be abandoned.  That is a very important route in the area which goes on into Millstreet and Macroom and also provides connectivity with Mallow and the city of Cork.

That gives us the opportunity to look across all service provision and plan the resources to ensure the links are better made between the services.  We continually review services on an area-by-area basis and just did a public consultation on services in County Mayo in respect of how we might better use the existing services there to try and meet local demand.

My second question is for Ms Graham.   From 2010 to 2014, what sort of cuts have been made to the NTA's budget?  What are the figures?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Nolan said that Bus &Eacute;ireann made a profit on the Expressway, and I would like to know what profit was made.  Anybody will know that in business you win some and lose some and you have to sort of take the good with the bad.  It is not just down to a simple matter.  Mr. Nolan spoke about different parts of rural Ireland, how Bus &Eacute;ireann is trying to help as much as it can, but he must also realise we have come through a fairly rough time, although going by the indications, there is all hope that the improvement is spreading out now.  What I get from Mr. Nolan is that Bus &Eacute;ireann is about to kill the goose that is going to lay the golden egg.  Things are starting to move on out towards different parts of rural Ireland, which had not seen an improvement up to now, and the sooner we see it the better.  Bus &Eacute;ireann may be making a decision too early.  In business as in any walk of life we have to take good and bad.  Mr. Nolan cannot give us a figure for exactly what Bus &Eacute;ireann was losing.  Overall, from what I understand, it is making a profit.  It is also making a profit on the school bus routes even though ten or 12 years ago some schools decided to amalgamate together - the goalposts have been changed in the last few years in some of that.<\/p><p>If we decide that a service will not go up a road where there is one house to deliver a letter, something is taken away.  An Post was mentioned.  Bus &Eacute;ireann seems to be taking the same attitude.  Basically, if the service is doing well, that is great, but if the service is not doing as well, it is time to say \"Goodbye\".  We welcome motorways and faster travel times but should everybody not play on a level field?  When the National Transport Authority, NTA, is giving out licences, should it not stipulate the towns to be serviced?  Anybody in a business will go for the most lucrative and shortest routes.  Should we not examine such issues?<\/p><p> Deputies Naughten and Feighan are also here.  I have spoken to people in Leitrim.  We have talked about rural transport and people trying to get to hospitals but such transport does not exist.  I welcome the comments that the witnesses will sit down with councillors and public representatives in each affected county.  There is a craving for services out there.  Meetings may help resolve the issues we have talked about today and a proper service would help to revive different towns.  We cannot just look at the short term or drop the hatchet.  The sun may be coming over the horizon but it seems people want to pull the shield down on it.  Some of these actions must be reconsidered.  People pay tax in all parts of the country and it is our taxes that subsidise what these companies are doing.  We have spoken about the routes and school runs, and taxes subsidise those services.  I am not talking about a single part of Ireland but all the country, and we deserve services in different parts of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#J00600","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":956,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation from Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA before us this morning.

Customers who wish to obtain an Expressway service need to go to Nenagh.  I have never had to avail of the service, for which I am glad, given my limited observations.  I recall being in Nenagh two years ago.  As the bus was about to leave, a woman honked her horn and flashed her lights to indicate that she had a passenger for it, but the bus pulled off.  I was going home via Birdhill, so I went that far and asked the bus driver why he had pulled off when there was obviously a passenger to be picked up.  I appreciate that it is Seachtain na Gaeilge, but the answer I received would not be readily translatable into Irish.<\/p> <p>  As a common citizen, I wrote to Bus &Eacute;ireann about this matter and received no reply.  Then I wrote as an elected representative and was assured that the matter would be investigated in the normal course of events and I would be informed of what happened.  I did not hear anything.<\/p> <p>  The next encounter I had with Bus &Eacute;ireann in Nenagh was to bring a passenger to the bus.  I arrived approximately two minutes before time.  I appreciate that perhaps I should have arrived an hour beforehand, seeing as how Mr. Nolan compared Expressway with Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  However, I arrived ahead of time, as did a group of other people.  We were told by someone else that the bus had left five minutes before time.  I was not alone in this.  I am not the only one who has had these misfortunate episodes in Nenagh while seeking to avail of an Expressway service.  I wrote to the company outlining that the bus had left at least five minutes before its scheduled time and that there was a group of people present.  I gave the company the contact details of the other people because I bothered to take them.  I am still waiting for a reply.<\/p> <p>  If Mr. Nolan wants to compare Bus &Eacute;ireann with Aer Lingus and Ryanair, he is free to do so, even though it might be a little bit ambitious, but Ryanair is learning that customer service is important.  It at least replies, albeit not very well, to some customer service queries.  I do not expect the witnesses to reply to the specifics I have raised, but is there someone among them to whom I can send all of this correspondence and expect a reply?<\/p><p>I appreciate sometimes buses can be delayed and that it is no fault of the bus driver.  Accidents happen on roads, there is extra traffic, etc.  At the very least, can we have an assurance buses will not leave earlier than they are scheduled, leaving groups of people standing in Nenagh wondering what to do for an hour while they wait for the next bus?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#L02300","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":992,"content":"<p>What are the actual figures for the amount of the PSO levy spent on the greater Dublin area and outside it?<\/p> <p>  The problem is there is a lack of joined-up thinking right across the board.  No effort is being made to make bus routes viable.  I accept the point made by Ms Graham that the PSO budget has been cut and more funding needs to put into this.  For example, Bus &Eacute;ireann announced it was a case of \"use it or lose it\" for route 21, the Westport-Athlone service.  That same week, the Department of Social Protection, which has its own budget, announced it was closing its community welfare clinic in Ballinlough, County Roscommon, and people have to access that service in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  Now people who badly need to get to the community welfare clinic in Castlerea will have to pay for a taxi to get there which will have to be funded by the Exchequer although there was a public transport service in place before.  It is the same problem for Rooskie where the Rooskie-Dromod bus service was removed last year and at the end of this month the community welfare clinic will be closed in Rooskie.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking between all of the State agencies involved.<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham needs to start banging heads together to trash out some of these issues.  I accept Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to look at the commercial test of its routes.  I know there have been huge changes because of the development of the motorways which has had an impact on services.  Ireland West Airport Knock has dramatically increased its passenger numbers with 1.1 million people going through it last year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, however, is looking at reducing services to the airport, not expanding them.  While Bus &Eacute;ireann expands services into Dublin Airport, it is withdrawing services from Knock rather than enhancing them.<\/p> <p>  The county hospital in Roscommon closed in 2011.  What discussions have taken place to date with the Health Service Executive, HSE, on this?  People in Roscommon now have to go for hospital appointments to Castlebar, Portiuncula and Galway.  A patient from Roscommon can get to Galway for an afternoon appointment but will not be able to get a bus home.  It is the same for Castlebar while one would have to wait until 4.30 p.m. for the return service from Portiuncula.<\/p> <p>  What discussions has the National Transport Authority, NTA, had with the HSE on facilitating transport to and from clinics and the timing of appointments?  For example, have the staff making appointments in each of those hospitals been given a copy of that timetable booklet produced by the NTA?  This would allow appointments to be scheduled to ensure patients, particularly older people, can get to them by accessing public transport rather than having to pay &euro;150 to &euro;200 for a taxi.  Does it not make more sense for such an integrated public transport approach rather than paying &euro;200 per taxi, some of it paid for by the State?  Providing such a transport service would also ensure people get to appointments in the first place, reduce do-not-shows, speed up access to treatment, reduce pressure on accident and emergency departments and the ambulance service and the chaos that causes, as well as reducing the financial impact these have across the operation of the health service.<\/p> <p>  It is frustrating for me that for the past 20 years we have all been talking about the need for joined-up thinking between all State and community agencies to link and maximise the use of services.  For the past 15 years, I have heard there will be co-ordination between the transport agencies and the HSE regarding hospital appointments but nothing seems to be happening.  All I see are more services reduced and, unless one is going to Dublin, one can forget about it.  There is the odd service to the likes of Galway and Sligo but forget about anywhere else.  It will not happen because it is not commercially viable even though the majority of services in the greater Dublin area are not commercially viable either.  They will continue but rural Ireland can forget about its services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#M00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":993,"content":"<p>I do not have the figures for how the PSO is split between the greater Dublin area and outside it.

That has been very successful in the regional cities where the revenue and passenger numbers have grown as a result of the changes we have made.  I agree we must do more in rural areas at making the services more efficient and to improve the integration of services to local hospitals.  The work has to happen on the ground locally to meet those demands for services.  The transport co-ordination units, formerly the rural transport groups, did try to make contacts with the HSE and local HSE services.

We hope that in time we can convince him that it might be different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#N01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>Any move towards timeliness - not just leaving late, which is to be avoided, but equally leaving early - is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#N01700","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>I agree.

I said this morning on Radio Kerry that the fact that the witnesses are coming to this meeting makes this one of the most important meetings ever held by the committee due to the importance of what we are discussing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Moynihan hit the nail on the head earlier by asking what services are being cut in Dublin and whether all of the routes in Dublin are making money.  The answer, clearly, was that Bus &Eacute;ireann is cutting nothing in Dublin.  It has loss-making routes in Dublin but it will not dare touch them.  However, the rest of the country, particularly rural Ireland, is fair game to be attacked.  It has lost its social welfare offices, Garda stations, post offices, shops and small pubs.  The next thing it is faced with is losing its bus service.  Over the last number of weeks I have been contacted by elderly people in particular, and users of the bus service in north, south, east and mid-Kerry to ask me if they will lose their bus service.  It is incumbent on the witnesses to tell us.<\/p> <p>  Our job as public representatives is to help and assist people in our communities.  We should know if services are going to be threatened, cut or reconfigured, to use the word used by the witness.  It is a word I would love to see the back of.  The HSE use it all of the time, saying it is reconfiguring its service.  Can people not just speak plain English and say they are cutting the service?  We are talking about a very important service and the people who have been in contact with me, and indeed other representatives, are deeply worried.<\/p><p>I want to know, for instance, if Bus &Eacute;ireann is looking at cutting services to Waterville, mid-Kerry and east Kerry.  I want to know in advance - as will my colleagues in Kerry, be they county councillors, Senators or TDs - what Bus &Eacute;ireann is thinking of doing and what it is proposing, because we want an opportunity to react beforehand, not afterwards.  I do not want to pick up a newspaper and read that such and such a service is cut or hear on Radio Kerry that such and such a service has been cut and the public will be let down.  We cannot have that.  It is not fair on Bus &Eacute;ireann's customers, who have relied on its service and who have been grateful for it.<\/p><p> Everybody has their own take on it.  I am not all negative.  I compliment Bus &Eacute;ireann on the service it runs.  Its representatives heard a negative story a while ago.  In my experience of Bus &Eacute;ireann's employees who drive the buses and those in Tralee who run the services, they are extremely professional, very courteous and good at their job.  I really mean that, because it is wrong to paint such a picture, although the Deputy was not doing that.  I would not want an impression to go out from here that Bus &Eacute;ireann gives a substandard service or that its drivers are not excellent, because my experience is the exact opposite, and I want to acknowledge that.<\/p><p> We have a chance to create awareness in these areas.  If this involves parts of Kerry, about which I am speaking specifically, I want to know Bus &Eacute;ireann's proposals and its representatives' thinking, because we want to save services if possible.<\/p><p> We have lost so much in rural areas over the years.  In the past there were politicians who decided it was a good idea to break up the rural rail network.  When we look back on that, it was a crazy decision.  For instance, if the railway line that went down into Cahirciveen was open today, it would change the county completely from both a tourism and a business point of view.  That happened all over Ireland at that time and it was a shame.  It should not have happened.  I do not want history to repeat itself.<\/p><p> I do not want us to lose services now because if we lose a service we will not get it back.  It is the same as the post office that closes or the pub that shuts down.  We will not get it back.  It does not work that way.  Whatever falls off the radar is gone and gone forever.  That is why we cherish and appreciate the service Bus &Eacute;ireann gives.<\/p><p> I appreciate and acknowledge the importance of commercial viability, but at the end of the day Bus &Eacute;ireann provides a public service, and we want that to continue.  The buses might not be full but the passengers who use them want that service.  They need and require it, and they rely on it.  I cannot stress enough how upsetting it would be for the passengers, not all of whom are elderly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#N02000","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>There are others waiting to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#O00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>I have been contacted by those who use the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus service for going to work and they are worried about what will happen.

I apologise for having to step out at one stage.  As a result, I missed one or two of the answers.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Graham and Mr. Nolan will be aware from our previous meetings, there are two main areas that impact on my constituents in Kildare South.  The first is Athy and the region to the north - route 7.  The other is the route along the old N7, now the R448, on which Bus &Eacute;ireann has not operated for a number of years.  J. J. Kavanagh used to operate a bus service on that route, but as of January it has withdrawn from it and now stays on the motorway.  This is a serious issue for the people of Castledermot, Moone, Timolin and Crookstown.  Those are two significant issues that need addressing.<\/p> <p>  The myth perpetrated by some commentators nationally that urban areas such as Dublin subsidise rural areas can be put to bed here, because we mentioned already how many of the routes in Dublin are public service obligations, PSO, and have their own challenges.  That argument, from commentators outside of this room, is not helpful.<\/p> <p>  My constituents are affected, particularly in the Castledermot area.  It has an impact on the young, from the point of view of students who need to get to college by travelling either south to Carlow or Waterford, or north to Dublin.  At the other end of the spectrum, older people have health appointments that need to be fulfilled.  This is also a significant issue in Athy, on route 7.<\/p> <p>  There is a sense that decisions the NTA makes do have consequences.  When the decision was made to grant Dublin Coach a licence to operate a direct route from Waterford to Dublin and then J. J. Kavanagh sought to change his licence to pull out of the Castledermot element of that route and stay on the motorway, those decisions had a knock-on effect.  I was struck by the presentation from Mr. Nolan from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There are a couple of phases that he repeats.  He talks about \"cherry-picking\" of routes and \"increased availability of commercial licences,\" and says, \"We cannot trade recklessly.\"  Decisions that are made about the liberalisation of routes have a consequence that could cost the taxpayer a fortune in increasing PSOs, because the alternative, which is not an option for anybody, is that we end up abandoning these areas.  It leaves the taxpayer with a fairly difficult decision and a growing bill for PSO, from the &euro;209 million mentioned earlier.  Will the NTA accept that decisions it makes have the knock-on effect of making certain areas not viable?  How can we avoid that in the future?<\/p> <p>  What analysis has the NTA done of options for the Castledermot route - the old N9 - and how long will it be before we have potential solutions?  This is even more time-critical than the Athy issue in that, since January last, we have lost seven or eight routes out of the Castledermot area.  Are there solutions for Athy on route 7 and how quickly will those be in place?  Perhaps the witnesses outlined that earlier, but I did not see it in the presentation.  If a PSO is the answer to route 7, will free travel pass holders be able to use them on future PSOs?<\/p> <p>  I missed the answer to Deputy Moynihan's question about the legislation stopping school transport procurement.  I concur with Deputy Denis Naughten.  I have worked closely with local rural transport in south Kildare, both in my time as a councillor and more recently, and am aware of the level of frustration experienced by some providers of rural transport in engaging with the HSE on simple matters such as co-ordinating times for a route to link in with the warfarin clinic in Naas.  Patients will be aware weeks in advance that they have an appointment at the warfarin clinic, and it is a matter of getting the times co-ordinated so that the bus can run at the same time.  Those who want to do their shopping can use that rural transport instead of incurring taxi costs, while significant costs for the taxpayer, through the HSE, for taxi bills can be avoided.  That particular matter was addressed to an extent, but not before a lot of heartache.  Leaving it to the local areas will not work.<\/p> <p>  We have been told there are difficulties with the legislation pertaining to school transport, and we need to know what those are.  As far as I know, everyone in this House would wish to maximise the use of school buses, which always do half their run empty.  Everyone in this House would wish to see maximum engagement, with Departments talking to each other in order to ensure that HSE does not spend millions of euro on needless taxi bills when there is a rural transport network that needs bums on seats to survive and that is quite flexible, in as far as it can be, in adapting.  If the NTA will not lead the charge on that, then I do not know who will.  The NTA should come back and tell us if the HSE is not giving it the information or if other State bodies are not doing so.  We are depending on the NTA to take the lead on this because we need to see improvements on that.<\/p> <p>  The solution here is not PSOs that will cost hundreds of thousands of euro.  We could cover the country in PSOs and have buses travelling half-empty much of the time.  We need to think bigger than that.  The impact on tourism and other sectors is key.  Those are my main points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#O00400","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late, as I had other business to attend to.<\/p> <p>  My concern centres on Laois and south Kildare.<\/p><p>Laois and south Kildare have been abandoned by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The old N8 route through Abbeyleix, Durrow, Cullahill and south of Abbeyleix is now not served, and that applies all the way down into County Kilkenny.  The old N7 route of Mountrath, Castletown and Borris-in-Ossory, which was then the Pike of Rushall and Borris-in-Ossory route is now gone.  The N78 route comprises Athy, Ballylinan, Pedigree Corner, Doonane, Crettyard and Castlecomer.  That service was due to go this month.  We held some meetings in Athy, including one that Ms Graham and Mr. Nolan attended the other night, where agreement was reached that Bus &Eacute;ireann would stay on the route until 31 June.  After that, the buses use the motorways and almost all the geographical area of the county and a huge tract of south Kildare will be left without any bus service.  That is unacceptable.  The towns and villages in the region have been abandoned.  The remaining few on the N78 route of Athy, Ballylinan, Pedigree Corner, Doonane, Crettyard and Castlecomer are about to be abandoned.<\/p><p> We must organise a public transport system that works.  I recognise one cannot run a bus up every boreen and that one cannot have the same level of service in a rural area as one does for a busy urban route.  That said, it should not be beyond us to provide a basic bus service to run along the main arteries and to connect people from local villages with urban locations for their hospital appointments, work, college and whatever else.  We must have an integrated approach and link up services while taking account of HSE hospitals appointments, working hours, etc.  We also need an integrated approach to building a bus service.  If we stick a plaster on the problem, all we will do is limp from one crisis to another.  A service will be provided for a while but when it is discovered that it does not work, the service will stop.  Therefore, we need to plan strategic routes and use them strategically in terms of times and so on.<\/p><p> Promotional work must also be done.  I am sure Mr. Martin Nolan of Bus &Eacute;ireann will tell me differently and that it has spent a certain amount on advertising.  Local advertising of a bus service has not been done.  I have not seen it done but perhaps it has passed me by.  I suggest that bus timetables and routes be published in parish newsletters.<\/p><p> We need bus stops because there is often only three bus stops every 15 to 20 miles of road.  We need secondary bus stops at places like Pedigree Corner and along such routes, and the same applies for Pike of Rushall and all of those areas.<\/p><p> We need bus shelters.  It rained very heavily as I travelled here this morning.  I have noticed that the bus shelters in Dublin are state of the art.  I argue that rural Ireland should get small areas where a bus can pull into and bus shelters can be located.  I visited the North last weekend and little perspex shelters have been erected all along the roadway of rural routes.  We must provide the same in the South or people will not use the bus service.  We need to have a planned integrated service.  <\/p><p> The immediate issue in County Laois is that it is not served by public transport.  The immediate threat is to the bus service on the N78 route and, therefore, we need a plan.  I understand, from what the National Transport Authority said that its main remit is licensing.  Somebody must solve this problem.  The Department will not do it or cannot do it and civil servants do not see it as a job for them.  We need to plan strategic routes which I see as a key job for the NTA.  If the NTA does not have the resources to do so, then it is up to us, in these Houses, to give resources to the authority.  That is the most important task.  We must also knock heads together to get a co-ordinated approach.  <\/p><p> I have questions for each organisation.  What subvention does Bus &Eacute;ireann receive?  It gets subvention for social welfare passes, and rightly so.  How much direct subvention does the organisation receive from the Government?<\/p><p> My next questions are for the National Transport Authority.  Its role is licensing, but what else does it do?  What has it planned for County Laois and south Kildare?  The issue of the N78 route must be addressed urgently.  We must retain the service and the witnesses know that from their attendance at the public meeting in Athy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#O00500","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late but I was in the Chamber participating in the marriage equality debate.  The use of Facebook, Twitter and similar outlets present a huge advertising opportunity for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I suggest such advertisements should be county specific.  A lot of people are unaware of services and such advertising would highlight routes and existing services.  The bus stops outside my office in Castlemaine and people often come into my office seeking information on bus timetables and services, which we provide.  There is a great opportunity to advertise for free, which we should avail of, and also to provide information on a county basis.  I suggest that before routes are axed, Bus &Eacute;ireann should make an effort to maximise the number of people using those routes.<\/p> <p>  There is technology available now to conserve fuel.  I know of a company in south Kerry that manufactures a device that reduces fuel consumption, a matter which I have raised at committee level.  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann, in an effort to reduce costs, explored reducing fuel costs?  Will it do so?  The price of fuel has reduced recently.  I have raised this issue by tabling a parliamentary question and I have received an answer from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Unfortunately, the price of fuel has increased again.

We have carried out a review of services in Kerry.  We are working closely with Bus &Eacute;ireann to deliver what we would hope would be an improved service in Kerry.  Prior to us implementing the initiative, Members will have the details beforehand.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the decisions that we make and the knock-on consequences of licensing decisions that Deputy Heydon mentioned, and in terms of looking at licences and licence applications, we want to provide an increased and better service for public transport customers.  We also want to grow public transport numbers.  By looking at the services in that way, we have had to refuse licences in some cases where we felt it could undermine the provision of services between those licensed services.  We feel it is not a consequence of the number of licences, more a consequence of the roads structure and infrastructure and also the demand by customers for quicker end-to-end journeys.  That is what has influenced the types of licence applications we have received and the types of decisions we have had to make.  As a result, Bus &Eacute;ireann has had to review the provision of its licensed services to respond to those changes.  It is our responsibility to see what is needed if there are places left without a public transport service.  While we have a responsibility in regulating licences, we also have a responsibility to see if there is a public service obligation in an area that requires to be met by a public transport service.<\/p> <p>  As we have indicated before, we have been limited by our level of funding in delivering more services.<\/p><p>We are grateful that the level of funding has stabilised in terms of the subsidy going into services.  We would like to see this increasing in order that we might start to fill the gaps and grow public transport services throughout the country.  It is this for which we need to plan.<\/p><p> In the context of what Deputy Stanley stated, our role involves bringing forward a plan for the putting in place of strategic routes throughout the country.  We have commenced work in this regard and we would like to put forward a general plan in respect of how Ireland is served by its main public transport services.<\/p><p> Deputy Heydon referred to HSE services.  As he is aware, it has been difficult, even locally, to integrate HSE and rural transport services.  However, we will continue to try to do this locally.  In addition, we will do whatever we can nationally in order to try to ensure that public transport services meet the needs of those of our customers with health issues.<\/p><p> When we draw up plans in respect of a replacement service for route 7, we will implement them as soon as possible.  A meeting of the working group is due to take place in the next week and we will be attending that.  A date for that meeting has not yet been decided upon but I am sure this will be done in the next couple of days.  We will bring forward our proposals at the meeting in question.  We must also be aware that there may be changes to the commercial services - even beyond those already planned - which we will also be obliged to consider in the context of what we will put in place.  However, we are actively drawing up plans and we will be ready to meet the working group in the coming days.  We hope that we will be in a position to put in place whatever solutions are agreed.  Again, this will be subject to the necessary funding being made available.  We will try to put the solutions to which I refer in place as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> On the question of what happens if free travel pass holders avail of what might be replacement services, the answer is that it would depend on the nature of those services.  As I indicated earlier, a cap has been put in place in respect of the free travel scheme and any new services cannot avail of a subsidy from the scheme in order to allow holders of the pass to travel for free.  Unfortunately, in certain instances where we have put in place some replacement PSO services, we have been obliged to charge concessionary fares.  Whether we will be obliged to do that in this case, we are not yet sure but it might be part of the consideration in terms of replacement PSO services along route 7.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley referred to having an integrated approach.  We want to bring such an approach to bear in the context of planning for services.  We are of the view that we are the only authority which can do so.  We want to continue to work on trying to integrate existing services and on using our resources more effectively.  In addition, we also want to plan for areas where we may need to deliver additional services.<\/p><p> In the context of infrastructure, we are aware that we need to put in place further bus stops and shelters.  However, we are limited in this regard in terms of the level of funding available and we must prioritise in the context of where we can deliver these infrastructure items.  We will be undertaking a process of putting in place new bus stops - at which integrated information will be available - throughout the country.  We are also working towards trying to integrate the stops as well in order that all providers will use the same stops.  This will, however, take a number of years to roll out.  In the context of bus shelters, we are similarly constrained by the level of resources available.  Again, we have been obliged to prioritise where we use those resources in order to put new shelter infrastructure in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>Ms Graham stated that the company is going to improve bus services in Kerry.

However, the most one would ever see at such stops is one, two or three individuals.  What are needed at bus stops in rural areas are simple structures that would perhaps be one quarter the size of those currently being erected.  These shelters should face away from the road in order that people would be protected from the spray caused by trucks, etc.  I saw one such structure when passing through Strabane in recent days and all it involves is a few upright sheets of Perspex with a small, slanted roof on top.  In addition, the shelter in question faces away from the road.  The entire structure was not much more than 1 m in length by 0.5 m in depth and I am sure the cost relating to it was extremely low.  I stopped to inspect it and discovered that information relating to all bus services on the route was provided on the sign attached to it.  The shelter is small and was obviously cheap to construct.<\/p> <p>  Some of the shelters built by Adshel in this jurisdiction are extremely big.  I accept that these are required in places such as Monasterevin because there could be 20 or 30 people queuing for a bus at any given time.  In some rural areas, however, one might only see one, two or three people queuing at bus stops.  All that would be needed at such stops is simple structure that would prevent the spray from lorries from hitting people in the queue.  If a shelter faces out into the road, people can often be splashed by spray from passing vehicles.  If the back of the shelter faces outward, however, protection is provided.  I reiterate my point that all that is required at bus stops in many rural areas is a simple structure with a small, tilted roof on top.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#Q01300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, the free travel scheme has been capped for the past number of years.  If a new commercial operator comes in to operate a service, it cannot currently avail of a payment under the scheme.  The operator would be obliged to make a decision as to whether it will allow pass holders to travel for free or whether it will be obliged to charge them the full fare.  That is a commercial decision which it must make.  In the context of replacement services in circumstances where we are providing a subsidised, PSO-contracted service, as the Deputy is aware, we were not able to avail of any subsidy under the free travel scheme in respect of the service we provided between Cashel and Portlaoise.  In order to make the service as viable as possible, we were obliged to charge a concessionary fare - half the normal adult fare - in respect of free travel pass holders.  It would depend on what services are being proposed in the context of replacement services.  We may be faced with the same kind of decision if we cannot access a subsidy under the free travel scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#Q01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>On any services we provide or are contracted to provide, we will accept DSP passes.

We must look at the work we have for the bus for a week.  If it is going to get a couple of big loads in the week, that is what is carrying it through the week.  As Ms Graham said, Bus &Eacute;ireann hires thousands of buses every day and we use the appropriate bus.<\/p> <p>  The major issue with regard to fuel economy is the driver.  One driver can be 20% more expensive than other.  We have telematics, engine cut-off at lights if the engine is idling, and defensive driving programmes.  We are looking at systems all the time.  The new Euro 6 engines are related more to emissions as they use as much fuel as the old buses.  They are not fuel economic.  We also have spill-free systems going into depots so we are conscious of that end of things.  Any systems members mention, we examine.<\/p> <p>  The real-time passenger information is not on the bus stop outside a business but on the app.  It was not perfect but is improving all the time.  With regard to marketing, Facebook and Twitter, the chairman said that customer service is the big aim this year.  We grew revenue by 6% or 7% last year and we need to go further on the customer service end.<\/p> <p>  This brings us back to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's question about staff.  Some 80% of our staff are customer facing and they are the biggest marketing tool we have.  They have had not had as rough a time as others have had but they have not had an easy time.  We are very conscious of that and we are grateful.

Some 94% of roads in the country are rural roads, which is nearly the highest in Europe.  It is a large investment programme but I take the point about it being smaller and spreading it more.  The Laois and south Kildare area always had private bus companies and we ran expressway buses through the area.  It has been the hardest hit area since commercialisation happened.  It brings us back to the point made by Deputy Martin Heyden that, with competitors, we are in a totally different place to where we were ten years ago from the revenue and cost base points of view.
