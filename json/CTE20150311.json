During our sessions this week, we will hear from a number of witnesses on the theme of relationships between state authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  Later this morning, we will hear from Professor Niamh Hardiman on systems of governance.  However, at our first session this morning, we will hear from Professor David Farrell, a professor of politics at UCD, to discuss the issue of public policy in parliamentary democracies.  He is a member of the Royal Irish Academy and a specialist in the study of parties, elections, electoral systems and Members of Parliament.  His current research focuses on the role of deliberation in constitutional reform processes.  In 2012, he was elected as president of the Political Studies Association of Ireland.  In 2013, he was elected as speaker of the council of the European Consortium for Political Research.  He is founding co-editor of the publication <i>Party Politics<\/i>.  Prior to his move to Dublin, he was professor and head of social sciences at the University of Manchester.  He is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As the witness has been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I invite Professor Farrell to make his opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#A00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426032000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak to the committee.  I have been invited to speak about the role of parliament in scrutinising government.  My paper has been circulated.  I propose to pick out some of the main features of the paper, if that is acceptable, and I will try to keep to time.  I apologise in advance if I inadvertently offend anyone in anything I say.  I am not a specialist in parliamentary procedure.  The members are and all of them know how this Parliament operates.  I am just an academic, a theoretician.  I have some knowledge of how the systems work in other countries, and that is the main reason I have been invited to contribute to the discussions.  If I make mistakes in what I say about the way in which the Oireachtas operates, I apologise.<\/p>  <p>  In my comments, I want to observe a general consensus, which is that the Parliament in Ireland is weaker than in most other countries.  That is the context for my paper.  What I want to addresses is the question of whether this might have contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the banking crisis.  I have framed the note in two parts.  I want to start by giving some general ideas on what we might consider to be an \"effective parliamentary democracy\".  I will set out the three main features of an effective parliamentary democracy and then address each of them in regard to the Irish case.  <\/p>  <p>         Starting with an effective parliamentary democracy, we might reasonably expect it to consist of three factors.  First, the parliament should be organisationally and structurally suited to fulfilling its scrutiny role over government.  What I mean is that we should see some appropriate structure both in its plenary sessions and in its committee structures.  In terms of its plenary sessions, among the things one gets from the literature is that the parliament should be able to determine its own agenda, to varying degrees in collaboration with the government.  However, the parliament has a big say over its own agenda.  At the heart of this is a chair of the parliament who is elected by the Members of the parliament, MPs.  In virtually all of the other European cases it is by a secret ballot of the MPs.  Regarding the committee structure, one should see that the committees have a very major role in the legislative process.  That would include, among other things, sufficient time for committee work.  The features I pick out include the proportional allocation of chair positions among the parties; the election of the chairs by secret ballot of the members of the parliament; the notion that committee membership is not a right but a privilege; the notion of a well staffed and well resourced committee structure.  These would be the main features of what we might expect of a well structured parliament.<br\/><br\/>Second, it is one thing to think about the parliament having control over its own agenda, but if we are to see it also operating effectively we must also think about the culture of the parliament and how it is attuned to its role as a more equal player <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the government.  The second main factor of an effective parliamentary democracy is a culture of effective parliamentary scrutiny.  How this plays out in parliaments today, particularly in the last part of the last century and the first part of this century, is through its committee structure.  We should see an effective use of the committee structure as the core to this.  In those parliaments with effective committees there is a tendency for many of the members of those committees to take their committee role very seriously.  Some even see the committee as an alternative career route to ministerial office.  We see committees that follow a tight schedule of policy scrutiny, with meticulous attention to tracking the detail of the policy process, careful background research, well structured interviewing of witnesses and a philosophy of operation that specifically eschews ambulance chasing.<br\/><br\/>There is a third feature of an effective parliament.  One might have a parliament that is well structured and a parliament whose members take their role very seriously, but the third link in the chain is a culture of open and transparent government.  This obviously relates to a robust freedom of information regime, whistleblower legislation and the like.  However, it also relates to how the government interfaces with parliament.  The government and its agencies must be prepared to work with parliament in providing access to information and to key officials.  Of particular relevance to the work of this committee, I would argue, is an open budgetary process and the right for parliamentarians to quiz heads of agencies and senior civil servants on policy and operational matters.<br\/><br\/>Those are the three main features of an effective parliamentary democracy.  How does the Irish Parliament relate to that?  As I said earlier, the first point relates to the strength of the parliament.  The consensus among academics is that the Irish Parliament is one of the weakest in Europe.  It is not just the academics who say it, the politicians also say it.  Look at what happened in the most recent election in 2011.  Every political party represented here put parliamentary reform very high on the agenda in their manifestos, so it is clear that the politicians think this.  A key feature of the programme for Government of this Government is a commitment to deal with parliamentary reform.  D&aacute;il reform was also a topic that was taken up by the Constitutional Convention as one of the agenda items it chose to examine.<br\/><br\/>It is the weakness of the Oireachtas that explains why so little attention is paid to it in the three reports we have had to date on the banking crisis.  Having read through the three reports in preparation for my presentation today, I was struck by the absence of attention to the Oireachtas.  The only thing I could find was in the most recent, 2011, commission of investigation report which says, in passing, that one of the causes of a systemic financial crisis is likely to include a parliament that remains unaware of the mounting problems.  That is the only reference I could find to the Oireachtas.  Given the recent flurry of interest in D&aacute;il reform, it would be nice to think that this issue has been resolved.  There is not too much evidence that the issue of a weak D&aacute;il has been resolved to this date, and I will be happy to discuss that matter in further detail during the questions and answers.<br\/><br\/>The second feature is the question of whether there has been sufficient scrutiny by the Oireachtas.  It is one thing to talk about the weakness of the Oireachtas, which I have just outlined, but it is quite another to see to what extent the Oireachtas has been making use of its existing powers.  As I outline in my document, committees already have quite substantial powers.  I list them on page 4.  The question is whether the committees were prepared to make sufficient use of those powers to test the veracity of the Government and other regulatory offices that were suggesting things were fine in the lead-up to the banking crisis.  The second point is the lack of scrutiny by the Oireachtas and whether a culture shift is required by the Oireachtas to address that.<br\/><br\/>The third feature of an effective parliamentary democracy is open government.  That relates to active engagement by the government with the parliament of the day, or Oireachtas in this case.  As I set out in my report, as a Westminster democracy we follow what is found in Westminster democracies.  First, there is a very tightly controlled, highly secretive budgetary process with a fixation on budgetary secrecy.  That question was meant to be addressed.  In the programme for Government in 2011 the Government talked about how it could open up the budget process to the full glare of public scrutiny.  We have yet to see that.<br\/><br\/>The second feature in the open government agenda is the issue of the ability to question senior civil servants.  The protocol followed in this country is that the Minister's word is final.  Any advice that might have been provided in conflict with the decision of a Minister is not divulged, and certainly not divulged to the Parliament.  In a context in which we know now, from the reports, that there were differences of opinion between Government Departments over the direction of economic policy leading up to the banking crisis, it should be possible for a senior civil servant to provide additional information to an Oireachtas committee on the different scenarios that might have been explored in the lead up to a decision.  Arguably, it should even be permissible for a civil servant to inform the committee of areas where he or she may have been in disagreement with their Minister.  That issue was raised in the Labour Party manifesto of 2011 and was included in the programme for Government: &quot;Restrictions on the nature and extent of evidence by civil servants to Oireachtas committees will be scrapped, and replaced with new guidelines for civil servants that reflect the reality of authority delegated to them, and their personal accountability for the way it is exercised&quot;.  I would hazard the argument that we get to see that.<br\/><br\/>In my main conclusion, what I draw from all of this in the period under scrutiny is that the Irish Parliament performed poorly.  It lacked sufficient organisational and structural fire power to provide effective scrutiny.  It lacked the political will to use what powers it did have, indicating what I call cultural shortcomings, and it was hindered by a governmental system that places great emphasis on secrecy, particularly in its dealings regarding budgetary matters.  There is little evidence to this day that those matters have been resolved.  My overall argument is that if the Parliament has sinned in any regard relating to the origins of the banking inquiry, it is more in respect of sins of omission than sins of commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you.

It is only by way of a fundamental overhaul that a cultural shift might be realised.  If only one or two things are changed, the culture of how the process operates will not change.  There is a need to change how the whole system operates.  In effect, I am suggesting issues such as what it is that motivates a Member of Parliament to be an active member of a committee need to be examined.  There is no doubt that this committee is a model of good practice and that its members take their role very seriously, for understandable reasons, given the subject matter of its deliberations.  Having appeared before and observed other committees, I argue that, in comparison with committees I have observed in other countries, there is a need for reflection on how committee work in this system is done.  While it is largely about changing the structures, it is also about changing how members treat their committee role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor David Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Pearse Doherty, in his written opening statement and oral commentary to the committee Professor Farrell said the failures of parliamentary practice in terms of oversight were more sins of omission.

There is a failure on the part of successive Governments, the current one included, to address a serious shortcoming in how government systems operate and that is the weakness of our Parliament.  There has been much talk about D&aacute;il reform, but we have yet to see serious D&aacute;il reform.  With the singular exception of pre-legislative scrutiny, there has not been serious engagement by this or previous Governments with D&aacute;il reform.  What many of us have been arguing for in terms of parliamentary reform - as I set out in passing in part of my paper - is a secretly elected Ceann Comhairle and a clear agenda for root and branch reform of how the D&aacute;il operates, with an equivalent exercise being undertaken in the Seanad at the same time.  There is a need to look at how the D&aacute;il can have a much greater say in setting its own agenda and the allocation of its own resources, with other reforms relating to how committees are formed, including the notion that committee membership is more a privilege than a right.  It should be the case, perhaps, that a Member would be appointed to no more than one committee and that committee work is viewed as a serious part of a Member's parliamentary work.  There should be committee weeks in order that committee members would have the scope to get on with their committee work, quite apart from any other legislative work.  There should be proper resourcing of committees and proper resourcing of the parliamentary function rather than the resourcing of individual parliamentarians.  I could go on, but these are the sorts of thing that have been mentioned and bandied about and on which we have yet to see any serious engagement.

They have a parliamentary role to play and should be serviced in that role.  If we were starting with a blank sheet, what I would be advising - others would agree with me on this - is that resources should be given to committees.  I can see that this committee is well resourced, but that should be the norm rather than the exception.  The library and information service should be better resourced than is the case.

All of this needs to change.  We need to move more towards a continental European consensus approach.

That is one of the abiding features of the consensus parliaments of continental Europe - a coalition accommodating an inclusive notion of government.  A coalition government is comprised of several parties, hence the need to co-operate and work well.  There is also a notion that at any given time one party might be in or out of government.  That means there is not an adversarial us versus them.  It is quite a different culture.  <\/p>  <p>         There is no particular reason we have to be like this.  All that is required is for one of the leaders of the parties represented here to make an undertaking in a manifesto for the next election that the first acts of his or her party if it is elected to Government would be to introduce a secret ballot to elect the Ceann Comhairle and to ask the new Ceann Comhairle to examine and change the Standing Orders for the D&aacute;il.

Professor Hardiman is associate professor of political science and public policy.  She has studied at UCD and Nuffield College, Oxford, and worked for a time at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.  For several years, she was a fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, where she was the tutor in politics before moving to the school of politics and international relations in UCD, where she is director of graduate studies and director of the interdisciplinary public policy programme.  Her research interests centre on the political economy and public policy.  She is interested in the politics underlying policy outcomes, the politics of how public policy priorities are formed and implemented, the implications of institutional design for good governance and the political economy of growth, distribution and redistribution.  Among her recent papers are work on comparative fiscal responses to crises, methodological challenges arising from analysis of fiscal policy choices, the political economy of housing bubbles, new approaches to thinking about the European periphery, the effects of crisis on State structures, the implications of State structures for vulnerability to crisis and the fiscal foundations of the State.  Professor Hardiman is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>Before I begin, I wish to advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As she has been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I have been invited to talk about governance practice in Ireland.  I think that the broad outlines of the banking crisis are familiar enough.  We know that the banks borrowed too much, they made too many risky loans and too little heed was taken of the growing property price bubble.  So, from a political science perspective, some of the key weaknesses that stand out for me are, first, there was too little oversight and accountability going on in the Irish political system.  The banks, we now know, were too lightly regulated, but in political life, too, the powers of Parliament to scrutinise policy were, in my view, too limited.  There was not enough accountability for things that go wrong, so it was often hard to learn the right lessons for the next time, or even better so there would not be a next time.<\/p>  <p>  Second, politicians and key public officials in some respects may have had too little distance from powerful private sector interests.  Third, there was too much consensus over policy priorities and critical views were marginalised.  There was too little specialised knowledge in the public service and there was a resistance to using expertise effectively.  Each of these features of the political system is in conflict with principles of good governance.  I would like to sketch in some of the institutional weaknesses that made these kinds of problem possible.<\/p>  <p>  For a political scientist, institutions are important because institutions that work well are crucial for good political outcomes.  They create the framework for people's interactions with one another.  That is what an institution is.  However, even good institutions can end up being run badly or operating badly, so there is always a need to have appropriate incentives to keep good standards of conduct going.<\/p>  <p>  When we are thinking about good governance, there is not actually any single agreed definition.  It is always something that is under debate, but there is an influential contribution to this debate developed by the Quality of Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, which says that good governance depends on what it calls the impartiality of institutions that exercise government authority.  In this sense, there are two aspects of impartiality in the way that the State relates to its citizens.  One concerns what I might say is the input side of things, that is, who gets access to public authority.  The principle here is that privileged groups should not be able to gain preferential access to decision making in ways that would distort considerations of public interest.  The other side of things is what I might call the output side of things, the outputs of political decision making, that is, the way political authority is exercised.  This means that procedural rules and guidelines should always be respected and no individual or group should be either favoured or discriminated against.<\/p>  <p>  So far, so good.  We might say \"relatively uncontroversial\", because these formal principles are well represented in Irish public life, but if we think about the Irish experience, we can see that there are a number of weaknesses in institutional design and in actual political practices.  I want to identify three areas that correspond with the three sets of problem that I mentioned just a moment ago.  These are about, first of all, political oversight and accountability; second, the relationships between political actors and private interests; and, third, the contestation of ideas.<\/p>  <p>  First, thinking about political oversight and accountability, governments have to manage public affairs, but policy also needs to be challenged and government needs to be held to account.  We have a power dimension, one might say, of the exercise of public power and also a legitimacy dimension.  It is more difficult in Ireland than elsewhere to scrutinise and amend legislative proposals and more difficult to hold the Government to account.  <\/p>  <p>         I believe this was the subject of discussions the committee held with Professor David Farrell in the last session.  His, and other research, indicates that the Irish Legislature is still a bit of an outlier in comparative perspective on these indicators.  Accountability within the public service is also a problem.  We are not always good at learning from mistakes when things go wrong in the public service.  Too often we are inclined to say that the system is to blame and we leave it at that.  All this is in the process of change at the moment.  The Civil Service renewal plans are aimed at reforming the ways the Civil Service functions and includes procedures to improve and strengthen accountability.  This is all very much a work in progress.  <\/p> <p>  My second point is about privileged access to decision making.  There should be distance in the relationship between private interests and public authority in both input and output.  We know there were close relationships between banks, builders, developers and political leaders during the years of the boom.  This is potentially a problem on the input side of things.  It may present a problem for Government's ability to take a measured view of its policy options or to establish enough distance and aggregate all the preferences it is exposed to in a public interest perspective.  We have legislation on standards in public office, regulation of political donations and freedom of information legislation, all of which really do help to reduce the incidence of inappropriate access and influence - but poor practices may be harder to control or eliminate.  Our ethics legislation dates from 1995 and 2001 and I do not think many people would suggest there were no problems at all in the years that followed.  Making sure that legislation has the desired effect may not be quite so straightforward.  <\/p> <p>  One way of having strong accountability in other European countries involves the strong role of parliamentary committees, but this is an area where there have been some weaknesses.  When we think of regulation in the financial sector there is also a gap between what the formal rules say and the way informal practices actually play out.  The powers that were available to the financial regulator before the crash were, as I understand, not excessively weak, but enforcing an effective regulatory regime is another matter.  The Irish form of light touch regulation was never going to get full disclosure of risks and liabilities on the part of the financial institutions.  Ireland was not the only country to commit taxpayers' money to providing guarantees to the financial sector, but there are a couple of things that stand out about the Irish experience.  Policymakers had fairly limited access to any kind of accurate information about the true state of the banks before the guarantee was extended.  This is a problem which goes back well beyond 2008.  It is a clear failure of the regulatory regime.  <\/p> <p>  Although large guarantees were extended in other countries, they did not necessarily have to put them into practice.  The difference lies in the organisation of the banking sector itself and the links they had with each other.  Denmark for example committed 259% of GDP to guaranteeing its banks and Ireland committed 232% - similar orders of magnitude.  While the Danish taxpayers were eventually liable for something like 1% of GDP, in 2012 it was estimated that the direct cost of the guarantee to the State was around &euro;64 billion, which is 41% of GDP.  It seems that the Government in Denmark was able to negotiate a sector wide rescue scheme which involved a lot of participation by the financial industry itself.<\/p> <p>  I am not saying that the Danish experience is directly translatable to Ireland, there are many problems in trying to translate practices from one country to another, but what it does illuminate is that the Government seemed to have very little insight into what was going on until it was too late.  As one analyst said it was \"torn between denial and panic\" when it was too late to do anything other than step into the breach with large guarantees. One might well think that in a small country like Ireland it is quite difficult to maintain appropriate distance between the regulator and those who are regulated, or between the powerful, wealthy business interests and the politicians.  Many of these people come from similar backgrounds.  They went to the same schools and may even be related to one another.  All of this plays a role in lowering the boundaries between the personal and the official political roles.  However, Denmark is also very small and socially interlinked.  Institutions need to be well designed and appropriate incentives and sanctions should encourage good practices to try to avoid the worst happening in the first place.  This involves informal practices as well as the formal rules and sanctions.<\/p> <p>  My third point is about groupthink and critical evaluation, groupthink meaning when critical judgment is not properly exercised.  Peoples' opinions converge on what is perceived as general wisdom without subjecting it to too much criticism.   Many people have commented on the scale of groupthink during the boom and this was clearly a problem, not just in the case of bank risk, but in macroeconomic policy more generally.  Ireland was far from unique in this naive faith in the self regulating market and the ideas that property prices were going to rise forever, there was going to be a soft landing and that this time is different.  This time is never different.  However, at the same time there were dissenting voices - people sounding the necessary warnings.  There were those who were uneasy about bank risk and the sustainability of the property boom.  Sometimes these people may have lacked the confidence to speak out too loudly, but there were enough who raised their doubts and their warnings.  For the most part they were criticised or even ridiculed.  The question now is how to create a space for those people who offer an alternative point of view, even though it is unpopular, so they get taken seriously and that countervailing opinion gets factored into the discussions, perspectives and anticipations?<\/p> <p>  Among the safeguards against groupthink in public life there has to be: high quality information available; a public service that can use the information well; practices such as having open environment for debate; critical engagement with different points of view in different fora; and encouragement of contestation over ideas in the policy process.  Open debate is the basis for informed analysis and good policy formation.  Developing the policy capacity of the public service was not very high on the list of political priorities during the boom.  Indeed, during those years there was a proliferation of new agencies.  Why were they created?  It was because often it was easier to do new things by adding on new skills outside the existing public bureaucracy.  We now have a lot of State agencies and there is a clear rationale for many of them.  Agencies which operate at arms length from Government can serve a valuable purpose.  In other cases one might have expected these new positions to be created inside Government departments themselves but instead we have this agency proliferation.  In 2008 the OECD commented, not favourably, on what it called the \"organisational zoo\" of Irish State agencies. <\/p> <p>  Good policy making also needs access to good technical skills of all sorts and these are improving now.  We have the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, but there are other areas where there are skills and competence deficits.  There have been questions, for example, about the management skills of the senior civil service.  Reform is under way in these areas, but it is still very much a work in progress.  We want the public service to act as a guardian of the public interest.  To do this it needs to maintain a culture of independence from political influence.  In formal terms that is well established in Ireland, but we sometimes hear it said that some senior civil servants may be less willing now than in the past to challenge Government ministers' points of view.  There may be a number of reasons for this.  In other countries, when a government is in power for a long period of time, civil servants may be more likely to align themselves with Government preferences.  The way we organise career promotions may encourage anticipatory adjustments.  It may be that civil servants are under a lot of day-to-day pressure to protect their Minister from criticism and from bad publicity in what is an intensely media saturated policy process.  <\/p>  <p>         Until quite recently, if individuals wanted to expose things that have gone wrong they could expect very little protection.  We now have The Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  That goes a good way towards remedying this, both in the private and the in the public sectors.  Here again if we want the legislation to have the effect that we want more is likely to be needed.  There has to be a culture of encouraging critical engagement.  The most effective way of doing this is to develop an environment in which debate and disagreement is normal, where discussion is not shut down too quickly in the interests of getting a decision, where people do not feel that their right to speak out is determined by their place in the hierarchy.  <br\/><br\/>Critical analysis is exactly what universities do.  We engage in information, research, evidence and so on.  Some progress has been made in engaging the universities in critical debate about public policy and public sector reform, but I think more could usefully be done.  We can also think about the role that civil society organisations may play, an active role as watchdogs over the public interest, over regulatory and other bodies.<br\/><br\/>Inside the banks themselves we can now see that there were weaknesses in corporate governance to do with this phenomenon of group think.  Banks engaged in very risky lending practices not least because their own shareholders put pressure on the directors to match the performance of the most profitable institutions, which were also the most risky.  No bank can grow its profits at the extraordinary rates that we saw during the boom, in a safe manner.  The brakes were off inside the high street banks too in terms of internal vigilance.  It might be useful in this regard to think about the differences in the governance of the Irish and the Canadian banking sectors.  The Canadian banks did not suffer systemic crisis this time around.  One contrast between the two systems is the fact that the Canadian financial regulator played a very strong role.  Bank directors expected rigorous and even painful scrutiny by the regulator and they internalised that expectation in the way that they conducted their own directorial responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>Inside the banks, the way the banks functioned also shows some interesting differences.  As I understand it, directors can influence board decisions and bank outcomes through very much the same sort of practice that I mentioned a moment ago, good information, good preparation, an ability to ask hard and unexpected questions, a willingness to be critical and challenging towards management and to hold them to account effectively.  In Canada, some of the corporate practices provided a stronger framework than may have been in existence in Ireland for encouraging these behaviours.  For example, Canadian directors often, it seems, hold <i>in camera<\/i>sessions without management present.  This lets them test ideas and build support among colleagues.  This seems to have helped the non-executive directors to avoid excessive deference towards managers and it strengthened the independent and challenging voices on corporate boards.  <br\/><br\/>In conclusion and in summary, I think what I have been focusing on is this feature of good governance centring on the idea of impartiality.  Good institutional design is vital, but so too are the practices that make institutions work effectively.  In the Irish case, this has implications in three areas that I have outlined.  My first point was about political accountability.  I noticed a relatively weak capacity to subject the Executive to scrutiny.  Improving accountability is still in its early stages. The second point is about the relationship between private interests and public office holders and this needs to be constantly monitored.  My third point is about the risk of group think and this persists as long as there is too little respect for informed critical opinion, too little willingness to look for high quality information and too little openness to debating and contesting ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Niamh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Hardiman for her opening statement.

Ireland and Britain stand out as having particularly weakly developed powers available to the legislature.  This is usually measured in terms of the powers and competences available to parliamentary committees, powers of compellability of witnesses, powers to command papers, but also agenda setting of the work of the parliament itself, the time-tabling within committees, the ability to get amendments accepted inside committees, the degree to which committees work along party political lines, the ending of debate and the guillotining of debates in committees.  All those indicators suggest that in Ireland and Britain the parliamentary committees have a weaker scope of powers available to them.  Many continental European countries have stronger powers.  The strongest of all are in Scandinavian countries, it seems, and in the Netherlands where committees have extensive powers to set agendas and so on.<br\/><br\/>To what degree is this influenced by the electoral system?  There is extensive debate about the Irish electoral system and electoral system reform is the first answer whenever anything goes wrong.  I am not so convinced.  Practices and expectations might not necessarily be changed by having, for example, a list PR system.  One of the things that is encouraged in continental European systems by having a list system, is the ability to prioritise getting people elected on account of their policy competence but there is a price to be paid for that and that is that they get onto party lists without necessarily having to have a very close association with their constituency base, with their electorate.  I do not have to tell that to people here.  You are all elected politicians.  You know much better than I do what it takes to get elected.The very strong features of the Irish electoral system are that it enables a strong connection with the local electoral base and to have a strong sense of responsiveness to civil society.

In the context of the banking crisis things did go wrong in the banking sector before.  There was a financial sector collapse in 1984 and I wonder if the right sort of lessons were learnt about risk that can happen inside financial institutions and the sort of oversight that may be required at that point.  We know, for example, that Pat Gallagher was subject to criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland and many commentators have asked why that was or why these were not pursued in the Republic.  <\/p>  <p>         I do not know the answer to that question.  There were questions about the financial sector in the past and questions were raised during the 2000s.  The Comptroller and Auditor General raised questions about the functioning of the regulator's office during that period.  German financial regulators suggested more vigilant oversight might have been desirable in the mid-2000s, but somehow these warnings and lessons were not taken on board or absorbed into a type of critical reflective practice in order that, in anticipation of things happening, measures might have been put in place ahead of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Niamh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Hardiman.

During the 1990s growth in productivity and adding new resources to the economy were generating a strong export performance and a strong performance in traded services.  After 2000 there was a shift towards investment in capital stock, most of which was going into construction, especially housing.  There are many reasons for this.  The Irish population was growing and there was a housing shortage; perhaps the early indicators of the housing bubble that were first explored in the late 1990s did not necessarily see the full magnitude of what was coming along.  The context had changed a great deal, of course.  By 1999-2000 we were living in the eurozone and very cheap credit was available.  We now see the fiscal incentives to facilitate additional economic activity in the area of construction were misplaced in terms of generating a long-term sustainable growth model.  They were also unwise in a context where it was becoming very much cheaper to borrow and use money in the banking sector.

As there is very little scope for evening out the economic cycle, corrective measures are introduced at a time when they are most difficult.  One of the corrective measures is the type of thing that has been put in place in recent years in the form of the Fiscal Advisory Council, to have an independent advisory body to provide information and expert and informed commentary on Government spending plans.  It would not stop the Government.  Irish Ministers for Finance have a tremendous amount of discretion when it comes to devising and implementing fiscal policy.  The good side of that is that when a quick turn around in policy is needed, as we saw in response to the crisis, Irish Governments, in the context that they have good networked governance in the wider society, which we can discuss as well, have the capacity to make policy and implement it quite well through a very effective public administration system.  They can turn around quite quickly.  The balance side of it is that if disadvantageous or perhaps unwise fiscal policy is being pursued, there is very little friction in the system.

Among the principles of good regulation are two essentials, the first of which is expertise.  It is important to ensure the regulatory system has strong expertise in the area it is trying to oversee because regulators are there to stop people from doing things they want to do.  When people want to do things, they will try to find ways around the rules.  Recently in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>, for example, Gillian Tett commented on the fact that the stress tests for American banks were possibly too lenient even still because the regulatory system was imposing stress tests that were too predictable.

They were of the view that, in the absence of a transfer union, a banking union, debt resolution and all of the things we have now learned as so important, it would prove somewhat problematic.  Maintaining an independent exchange rate regime was very challenging for Ireland at the time.  On the whole, compliance with the requirements to join EMU worked well for Irish economic performance in terms of the policy process.  In the early stages, most people expected that upside would be very strong and that integration with the wider European economy would be facilitated by the single currency, that trade would improve, that our export links with other eurozone countries would be intensified and so on.  Adaptation to the new policy regime, whereby there was no control over exchange rates and monetary policy, was probably slow in coming because it attached new importance to the domestic capacity to manage by using just cost-containing mechanisms, fiscal policy, etc.  What people did not realise was all the perverse incentives that would spill out from having such low interest rates.  <\/p>  <p>         That was a shock that was genuinely hard to manage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#Y01900","nonspeaker":"Professor Niamh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The new, ethical and open complex that the professor has described to us sounds most interesting.

At the time I am speaking about, some banks were growing profits at a rate that most expert commentators would have thought to be unwise.  There would have been a question about the riskiness of the business model they had been pursuing.  If there was nothing illegal about what they were doing and if they were not constrained by regulation from what they were doing, there was nothing in essence to stop them other than what their own internal audit or risk management might have suggested.<\/p>  <p>  My observation is about the pressure this puts on other financial institutions that are also responsive to their own shareholders.  When an economy is in this exuberant state, people expect their investments to yield a good return.  My comment is that people should be sceptical about the durability of the business model that their money is tied up in.  The economist, Hyman Minsky, is often cited nowadays because a long time ago he developed a model whereby he predicted that crashes were inevitable, that financial crises will recur and will happen for different reasons next time, but they will happen.  They can be worse or less damaging, but they will be driven by the acceleration of expectations that there is money to be made.

In my letter of 12 February, I sought to clarify parts of my evidence to the inquiry on 15 January.  I have prepared these short introductory remarks on the presumption that the inquiry has invited me back on this occasion to amplify my views on the alternative courses of action that might have been taken by the Government at the end of September 2008.  Perhaps I should recall explicitly that I myself had no involvement in the guarantee decision, so my views are based on what I learnt from preparing my May 2010 Report on Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy, as well as on many conversations with other experts and on my general knowledge of banking crises in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with a critique of the decisions of end-September 2008.  There are several features of the decisions at end-September that can be criticised even allowing for the limited information then available to the decision makers.  The first was the guaranteeing of some of the subordinated debt.  Providing an explicit guarantee to subordinated debt holders is not only potentially costly to the State, but undermines the rationale for allowing banks to meet part of their regulatory capital with subordinated debt.  This was a definite design flaw in my opinion.  True, thanks to steps subsequently taken, the pay-out to subordinated debt holders of Anglo in the end was a small proportion of the total fiscal cost; however, that pay-out was not negligible.<\/p>  <p>  The second was guaranteeing existing outstanding debt, namely, senior bonds and term deposits, was not necessary to underpin the banks' continuing access to funds.  Nor did the government guarantees introduced by other countries in 2008 offer any significant backward-looking protection in this way.  It is true that imposing losses on such bondholders would have had a damaging reputational effect on Ireland as a whole, as well as impacting local holders of such bonds; but that is a different question.  The decision to impose such losses could not have been lightly taken; but offering a pre-emptive guarantee on already outstanding or what I call \"old\" debt ahead of a full assessment of what it might cost was essentially gratuitous.  Furthermore, because much of this debt entitled the holders to immediate accelerated repayment in what is called \"an event of default\", the Government was effectively precluded from liquidating or extensively restructuring the guaranteed institutions because it would have to repay the guaranteed debt forthwith, which it would have been unable to do because of the sums being so large.  This effectively postponed the drastic restructuring action that was needed until the end of the initial guarantee period, by which time the Government's entry into the EU-IMF programme was actually imminent.<\/p>  <p>  The third was failure to consult.  The Irish decision to provide a blanket guarantee without prior consultation triggered immense pressure for guarantees all over Europe.  Other governments resented the Irish action and this has made it difficult for the Government to make its case for burden sharing with Europe.  <\/p>  <p>         The fourth was the failure to seize immediate control over the management of Anglo Irish Bank.  It should be assumed that the existing management of a bank whose business model has lost the confidence of the market and which has run out of cash has neither the expertise nor the incentive to recover the situation safely.  The public authorities should have intervened immediately to take control of the bank, for which nationalisation was the available tool in Ireland.  Fortunately, nationalisation did follow in January 2009 without evident value destruction having taken place in the intervening period. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>How much does this matter?  Having made these criticisms, it is important to keep the scale in perspective.  The decisions on the night of the guarantee had consequences for Ireland but there has been a tendency to overstate the extent of the impact of that night's decisions on the subsequent welfare of the nation.  It would be hard to deny that most of the overall hardship that followed the bursting of the bubble was already inescapably embedded in the situation.  I will be put a number on this because quantification is important.  While it is not a precise figure, I would hazard that at least between 80% and 90% of the overall hardship was already inescapably embedded in the situation, albeit unbeknownst to the decision makers that night.<br\/><br\/>The damage had been made unavoidable by the unrestrained credit and property boom.  The fiscal austerity measures that had to be taken were not just due to the &euro;40 billion or so in additional net debt that can be linked to the guarantee, which I mentioned the last time I came before the committee, but also reflect the far larger impact of the ending of the construction boom on the Government's tax revenue and spending needs.  The fiscal costs are only one aspect of the total damage to Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In my letter to the inquiry of 12 February, I distinguished between a hypothetical hindsight scenario in which the Government would have been convincingly advised of the actual likely magnitude of the cost of a guarantee and the actual scenario with only the information available at the time.  In the actual case, the Government had no information at hand indicating that any of the banks were about to experience losses far in excess of their capital reserves.  What I have suggested as the best course of action, given the lack of such information in scenario 2, namely, buying time for negotiation with partners, seizing control over the two failing banks and limiting the scope of the guarantee, could hardly, unless the negotiations had proved remarkably successful, have reduced the direct fiscal bill by more than a few billion.  While this is not an insignificant sum, it is a fraction of the actual damage. <br\/><br\/>The alternative under the hindsight scenario of bailing in some of the bondholders and depositors of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS would have imposed additional disruption to economic activity and capital formation, which would have offset much of the savings to the State from not paying the creditors.  This point is made in the report of May 2010.  I conclude that the need for austerity measures - the scale of tax increases and expenditure reductions that have proved necessary since - could have been reduced somewhat but not all that much by anything done at the end of September 2008.  <br\/><br\/>It is important to maintain perspective and I would like to bring to your attention and call to mind some points of balance and perspective.  First, as I remarked recently in an article in a newspaper, the boom and bust both damaged our economy.  The boom and the decisions taken during it meant Ireland had to adjust down from living standards that could never have been sustained, with sizeable and capricious shifts in the distribution of wealth.<br\/><br\/>Second, the style of banking in Ireland, its regulation and broader economic policy were strongly influenced by comparable styles adopted at that time in countries often used as exemplars for Irish decision makers, in particular the United States and United Kingdom.  This was not a solo run but the scale of the excesses in Ireland put its banking crisis in a different league, although they were not as bad as in Iceland. <br\/><br\/>The third point of balance is that the extent and nature of the guarantee decision frustrated subsequent efforts to minimise the costs and speed the recovery.  However, the bulk of these costs could not have been avoided by a different course of action on the night of the guarantee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Honohan.

It is important that people are clear on that.<\/p>  <p>  The legal opinion is that there are two particular legislative provisions that are very relevant here and give the Governor power to step into a situation which should be managed by the Financial Regulator.  When I refer to the Financial Regulator, I am not talking about one person but a whole section of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of the time.  Section 23 of the Central Bank Act 1971 is a very old provision.  In fact, I think it is a slightly modified version of the provision in the 1942 Act.  It is a general power to require banks or a particular bank to maintain specific ratios.  However, as it does not say what these ratios are, it means any ratios in principle.  This is a very wide and old-fashioned type of power, which effectively says, \"We trust you to establish ratios which are for the safe conduct of banking\".  These powers are embodied in the Central Bank board and delegated to the Governor.  They are, therefore, wide but general types of powers.  That is one thing he could have used.  He could have said, \"Look, the situation is very bad and I am going to appeal to the 1971 Act, intervene and require the banks to have a ration of not more than 20% of their assets in this type of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Could that include credit concentration limits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426032000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Yes, it could.<br\/><br\/>Turning the clock back ten years or so, the legal opinion in the Central Bank would have been that this was mainly used for the purpose of liquidity ratios and it was not ever used in a precautionary way for the balance sheet risks on the loan side.  It is clear, however, that the power was there.  <br\/><br\/>The members, as legislators, are aware that when one introduces new and very specific powers, it very often weakens the old, general powers because some bank might challenge them by saying, &quot;You are imposing this power under the 1971 Act but I cannot see why you are doing that because clearly the legislator has decided that there are some specific powers&quot;.  However, the advice is that those powers were there and could have been used. <br\/><br\/>The other provision gives the Governor, having regard to his European responsibilities in the European System of Central Banks or the board of the bank in relation to its objectives, particularly financial stability objectives, the power to issue guidelines to the Financial Regulator as to the principles and policies that it was required to implement in performing functions.  That is a different type of action.  I think that would have been the first course of action.  If the Governor felt he wanted to intervene and change the way the Financial Regulator was doing things, he would have probably used that guidance power, which would amount to a significant interference with the functioning of the Financial Regulator, before using the first power that I mentioned.  <br\/><br\/>I am saying this very much <i>ex post<\/i>.  People at the time never imagined the Governor doing these sorts of things, although it is mentioned in an analysis by the ECB, which was required to opine on central bank legislation.  The analysis highlighted the importance of this power but I believe it was thinking primarily of the power in connection with the European functions of the Governor and not in relation to concentration ratios or whatever. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031100002#NN00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426032000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Honohan.

First, as we said, it might be &euro;40 billion that was taken over.  The other losses to the Exchequer - the revenue losses and the other costs - were much larger than that so even if they had found a way, on 29 September, of saying, \"&euro;40 billion - magic it away to zero\" they would still have all those other losses of tax revenue.  The collapse of the property bubble created costs to the State which were much larger.  That does not mean the &euro;40 billion was not important.  It was.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the hindsight scenario I outlined was that they would have decided they were not going to pay for this, that it was too big and certainly not worth &euro;35 billion or &euro;40 billion.  That would have had its costs as well because we know how disruptive it is to proceed to a liquidation and eventually to a bail in of depositors and bondholders, as we have seen in Cyprus.

At the outset I think it is important to put on the record that RGDATA members are and always have been very strong supporters of the national lottery in Ireland.  Our members are the owners of around 4,000 shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets, the majority of which are national lottery agents.  They have helped to build the national lottery to the successful national brand that it is today.  The partnership with the national lottery is important to our members' businesses.  The presence of a national lottery terminal and scratch card games in a shop helps attract footfall and encourages customers to the premises.  In addition, as owners of businesses that are rooted in their communities, our members recognise that the national lottery plays and important role in contributing to good causes locally and, as community-based retailers, local shop owners also share in the development and support of community facilities established with national lottery funding.<\/p> <p>   My members operate in a fast, demanding and extremely competitive and customer-focused environment.  They are used to change and innovation and work hard to ensure that their customers are satisfied with the service that they receive.  They work hard to get customers into their shops and try to ensure that they have a pleasant shopping experience each time.  My members are also adept at embracing new technology and are happy to work with suppliers to ensure that the latest systems are introduced and applied effectively and efficiently.<\/p> <p>   When the Government announced that it was preparing to sell the national lottery licence, RGDATA campaigned to ensure that the retail agents' margin was ring-fenced in any licence agreement.  I am happy to say that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and many Members of this House supported us in this cause and the Minister recognised the importance that the modest margin made to local shops and he agreed to our request.<\/p> <p>   When Premier Lotteries Ireland, the new operator of the national lottery, was appointed, retailers were ready and prepared to work with it to ensure that the fine reputation of the national lottery established over 29 years was maintained and grown.  They have been willing to embrace new technology and have been assured that the new operator was committed to the retail channel and would be investing in in-store service for retail agents and the many lotto customers who like to purchase national lottery products in shops.  <\/p> <p>   There were indications of some teething problems around the end of 2014 when the new ticket terminals went live.  Retailers were generally prepared to be patient with the operator to see if these problems could be resolved.  However, the scale of the problems that have emerged since have been significant and the initial response of the national lottery to address these genuine problems raised by retailers was poor.  Earlier this year when RGDATA circulated the results of a members' survey that clearly highlighted retailers' concerns, instead of accepting the deficiencies in the service and addressing them in an upfront fashion, the national lottery seemed to be more interested in denying the problems and shooting the messenger.<\/p><p>I am happy to say that situation has changed and a lot has been done since then.  We believe we need to work hard together to restore customer confidence.<\/p><p> What lies at the core of the retailer frustration in regard to the national lottery is some very poor communication by the lottery with both retailers and customers.  This poor communication has compounded and fuelled dissatisfaction over repeated technical issues that have emerged and led to a lack of confidence on the part of retailers about the new operator's approach to customer service and technical competence.  We want to rebuild that confidence.<\/p><p> I want to give the joint committee a flavour of what RGDATA members have been saying about the national lottery.  This is from the full gamut of RGDATA members who cover symbol group stores and independent, non-aligned retailers.  All of our members have experienced technical issues with the new terminals.  These include problems with the operation of the new machines, the sensitivity of the scanning system, and the system constantly freezing and having to be rebooted.<\/p><p> They have also had complaints from customers about the new playslips being difficult to read.  Retailers have complained about the surface on some of the scratch cards that the scanner will not read.  The absence of self-service ticket checkers has proven to be a significant irritation both to lotto customers and retail agents.  It means that customers are unable to check if they have a winning ticket and are dependent on the retailer to scan the ticket.  When the retailer's scanner is not working this leads to real customer frustration, queues and anger.  Retailers are getting the blame for these queues and delays, not the national lottery.  One retailer was told by a customer that if he paid his Internet bills on time he would not get cut off.<\/p><p> There have also been problems with outages with the services.  There have been a number of outages with the ticket terminals, where machines have crashed for significant periods of time.  As members of the committee know, this led in one instance to the postponement of a national lottery draw for the first time.  Even yesterday, members we spoke to said they were still experiencing stoppages and having to reboot terminals.<\/p><p> We have also received complaints about plasma screens that are not working.  These big, 42-inch plasma screens are in a prominent position by the till to advertise new draws, big jackpots and provide countdowns to draws.  For example, a screen in one member's shop in Kerry has been out of commission since last November.  He is obviously frustrated at the lack of response to his telephone calls to the national lottery asking it to deal with the issue.  Another member in Cork says his screen is down and there is no word on when it will be back in service.<\/p><p> We have also had complaints about poor customer service and responsiveness.  My understanding is that may be improving but I am telling the committee about the experience of retailers since the changeover occurred.  RGDATA members who have contacted the national lottery customer service desk by telephone have been frustrated by calls ringing out, no call-backs, and inadequate information being provided to retailers.  We will be seeking reassurances that the national lottery has staffed up the customer service line and will be dealing with these issues.<\/p><p> Another issue that has arisen for our members-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I am sorry but Ms Buckley's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#E00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":738,"content":"<p>That is fine but may I finish what I was saying?

The CSNA represents over 1,200 individuals in 1,500 stores throughout the Republic of Ireland.  The vast majority of these stores are agents of the national lottery. <br\/><br\/>When the Government announced its intention to offer the operation to license the national lottery for a 20-year period, we engaged the services of Mr. Anthony Foley of DCU's economics department to prepare a submission for the association to assist us in our attempts to ensure that the existing commissions earned by our members were maintained at the levels enjoyed under the licences held by An Post &ndash; The National Lottery, levels that were not fixed in the original legislation setting up the national lottery.  Both Mr. Foley and the association attended meetings with the team that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, had assembled to oversee the process.  We were pleased to secure the commitment of the Minister that the retailers' commission would be safeguarded and maintained at the existing 6% level.<br\/><br\/>The association met with the national lottery and Camelot on a number of occasions to discuss matters of vital importance to our members in advance of the tender process.  While we were prepared to deal with any of the prospective owners, we made it clear to the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that our working relationship with the management of An Post - The National Lottery was very strong and we would be best pleased to continue working with them after the new owners took over.<br\/><br\/>Our relationship with the national lottery is over 27 years old.  We have taken part in assisting new applicants to familiarise themselves with the licensing process and the day-to-day accounting requirements to prevent, or minimise, internal and external fraud.  We were responsible for promoting the idea of a lottery agents' council to Malachy Moynihan and Ray Bates, taking a leaf from <i>Crowning the Customer<\/i>, the book by Senator Feargal Quinn who is a strong advocate of listening to the customer.<br\/><br\/>The agents' council has been responsible for many years for teasing out various initiatives that have been to the benefit of the playing public.  We can say with certainty that each of the CSNA representatives on the agents' council has been diligent in informing the association on the deliberations and decisions being considered.  My colleague, Joe Tierney, is a member of the CSNA national executive and is on the national lottery agents' council.  He will be able to address any questions regarding the present level of communication and actions that both the CSNA and the Lottery have engaged in over the past six months in the lead-in to, and during, the transition.<br\/><br\/>As chief executive, I had five high-level meetings with senior management in the lottery to discuss various commercial options that needed to be considered when the financial aspects of the licence moved from the Department of Finance into that of a private company.  These included the migration of direct debits, the standing of existing securities or guarantees, the transitional periods' accounting processes, and the extinguishing of liabilities due to the old company.<br\/><br\/>We were at all times briefed by the national lottery on the transitional roll-out, both directly and via the agents' council representatives, and provided updated information to all our members through our weekly e-zine.  The date for the changeover was in doubt up until the final few days, as the lottery was awaiting final checks from its software providers that the system was good to go.  We had discussions with the lottery on the merits and detractions in deferring the roll-out until after Christmas and told them that if the roll-out was deferred, they would need to reconvene the training sessions that had previously been held, as the time-lag would be too great for retailers and their staff to retain information given to them at a distance of more than two months.  We had no reason to believe that there were any problems beneath the surface.<br\/><br\/>The roll-out was the largest single logistical operation in our FMCG sector since the advent of the euro.  Every detail had been considered and checked.  Those areas affecting retailers were advised to the council and they expressed themselves to be satisfied with the process as planned.  Planning and attention to detail was not the problem.<br\/><br\/>The teams assembled by the national lottery worked diligently and methodically to achieve a seamless transition of the product from the old to the new.  It may have been considered that the advent of a new operator would wish to change the logo or signage in our stores, but such was the level of belief in the brand that there was no determination to change.<br\/><br\/>It is our belief that there are two central criticisms that need to be addressed.  The first is the decision to move from a primarily broadband-connected service to one that relies upon wireless free.  The second criticism is the lack of communication with the public both on the transition and the difficulties being experienced in accessing products and services that the public had become accustomed to using.  Retailers are agents of the national lottery but were not given timely information on difficulties being experienced.  Nor were they the recipients of any posters or leaflets for display until CSNA demanded that they be printed and forwarded explaining that certain delays and faults were at lottery-level and not the fault of any individual retailer.<br\/><br\/>Only the  national lottery can answer why it moved from broadband and whether the decision to install a certain type of terminal was the correct option, or the least expensive one.  There are concerns within our industry that such choices may not have been made if the old An Post - The National Lottery company was making that decision.  We represent members that rely significantly upon the direct and indirect income derived from the sale of national lottery products.  We do not wish to drag either PLI or any of their shareholders or staff into areas that would injure the brand, given the importance that we attach to selling a unique and hitherto blemish-free product.<br\/><br\/>We acknowledge the desire of the committee to consider what, if any, systemic problems may be present in the current set-up.  We respectfully suggest, however, that it does nothing that would further damage the level of trust the public has with a product designed to promote good causes, and which brings a little joy into all of our lives.<br\/><br\/>The national executive of CSNA endorses the unanimous affirmation given by the agents' council to continue to work with the lottery to resolve all outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":741,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Sean Fleming who has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#E00600","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses here today.

It reflected badly on the retailers and I can understand that from the witnesses' viewpoint.  When somebody goes to a shop, having bought a national lottery ticket, and sees that the ticket-checking machine does not work, they begin to wonder about the retailer.  They eventually realise, however, that it is not the retailer's fault.  I sympathise with front-line staff who have taken unnecessary flak on behalf of the national lottery.<\/p><p>The reason we are here is that the Government decided to privatise the national lottery licence.  It has been implied that some of these problems might not have happened under the former management regime when broadband was used. <\/p><p> I have a number of brief questions arising from the decision to raise money by privatising the licence.  I know An Post has a 20% stake in the new franchise but it is very much a small player.  Those who have studied the change will know that the problem has arisen because of the move from broadband to one that relies on wireless free service.  To most people that sounds like a backwards not a forwards step.  I propose to raise this issue with the national lottery operators when they come before the committee.<\/p><p> Will the witnesses outline the impact that has had on shops?  We know that wireless free signal even in the long term is not always secure as local outages can easily happen.  I also know that things can happen with broadband but the wireless free system is not as reliable as broadband. <\/p><p> The national lottery had a blemish-free record and I worry about its future record.  Perhaps we are only seeing the tip of the icebergs in the problems that might arise.  I know that the new equipment will be honky dory by the end of the month.  We have been hearing that assurance for a while.  <\/p><p> The witness have suggested that the move to the wireless free service may have been a cheaper option, and I am beginning to consider that was a reason for taking that route, but will they outline the implications of moving from a broadband connected service to a wireless free service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#E00900","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I will pass that question to a retailer, Mr. Joe Tierney, the man who relied on the national lottery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":747,"content":"<p>As a retailer-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Tierney"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":748,"content":"<p>Where is Mr. Tierney's business based?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#F00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I have a newsagents, Tierney's Newsagents in Navan.  We are the oldest family newsagents in the country.  We have been proud national lottery agents since the inception of the national lottery some 28 years ago.  The outage of service last month was the first time that had happened in 28 years.  It has been well documented that this was the first time the national lottery had to cancel a draw.  The old regime used broadband and we had no issues.<\/p> <p>  The national lottery has full confidence in the wireless free system as a suitable system and that it moves from the strongest signal each time.  The national lottery, however, had the perfect storm of a new system, machines and terminals that the agents and staff were not familiar with and an outage of Telef&oacute;nica in Spain that brought down all of the wireless system in Spain for two hours.  The national lottery delegates will explain when they come before the joint committee why it took nine hours rather than two hours for our terminals to work.  This led to major issues in stores with people having to come back a few times.  Eventually the lottery took the correct decision to move the draw to the following day and give everybody a second bite of the cherry or to those people who had not got a chance to buy a ticket.  <\/p> <p>  There is no question but that there are current teething issues with the new system but after 27 years of the one system and 20,000 parts that have gone into 3,800 stores across the county that would be expected.  The main time we would have expected a problem was on 30 November when the changeover happened, but that was pretty much a seamless operation.  Since that there have been a number of outages, each for different reasons and the lottery said as recently as last week that other issues may come down the line and that they cannot categorically state they will not be other issues.  Part of the problem is down to the newness of the system and the adaptability of being able to fix it as quickly as they would have been to fix the broadband service.  Change brings its own problems.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jennings alluded to the National Lottery Users Council, a council that was set up 15 years ago, which invites two members from the CSNA, NFRN, RGDATA and the Postmasters' Union to meet with the lottery on at least three occasions a year.  Since the advent of the changeover we have met monthly for the past seven months.  At all times the national lottery has kept us very well informed of the procedure on a month by month basis, have come back and asked us for our views and in most cases have implemented what we as agents and those operating the machines are observing and would like to see changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Tierney"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

A date had been picked for the launch and the national lottery were trying to make certain, as far as it was concerned, that everything was right.  There had been a delay and it was going down to the wire.  Obviously we needed to know so that our staff would know the style of play tickets and which terminal to use, as we had both terminals side by side.  Literally three or four days beforehand, we knew it was all go.  It was not that we had highlighted a difficulty but the lottery when it was doing its systems processes, needed to be absolutely certain.<\/p> <p>  In hindsight it may have been better from a sales point of view for the changeover not to have taken place in December because we lost a number of sales opportunities that traditionally would happen throughout the Christmas period but as one knows, from having a family business, when one loses on one thing one pulls up some bit on another.  <\/p> <p>  I will allude to the issue of compensation.  If my newspaper distributor chooses not to deliver papers to me today because it is snowing I cannot get compensation.  There are many unfair practices levelled against retailers and small businesses.  Compensation did not form part of our thought process.  In a 20 year time span with thousands of sales, all we wanted to do was to ensure that we had the system we were hoping to have.  We are not jumping up and down looking for compensation.  All we want is to be able to sell the product, sell as much of it as possible quickly and efficiently.  As it so happened the day following the outage, our sales were more or less at the same level if not better than they would have been.  We did not lose out.  We are not crying for compensation.

I might add that the national lottery has an incredibly good sales force but I refer to a time when one has fewer people and encounters a real problem, when every call is now taking twice and thrice as long as it had previously and one has people frustrated because no answers are forthcoming.  As a representative association, the CSNA sent out text messages and e-zines to contact our members.  We had no difficulty with doing the work that perhaps was a shared job or a job of the lottery.  However, it is very difficult when one cannot get information in those crucial times and when one knows that somebody else who should be there is being paid to do it.

If the media can get a scandal, it circulates.<\/p><p> At shop floor level we have had some hassle and some problems.  The biggest problem is with the ticket checker.  One never realises how much one uses something until it is gone.  If any of us were to have our mobile telephone take from us today we would feel like our left hand had been taken away.  The ticket checker worked well.  It allowed people to find out quickly whether they had a winning ticket or not.  Now, counter staff have to check the tickets and tell people whether or not they have winning tickets.  The national lottery direction is that we give tickets back to people.  However, many people ask us to tear them up.  Sometimes people come back saying they believe the ticket they were told was not a winning ticket was in fact a winning ticket, which is unsavoury.  We only discovered in September-October last that the ticket checkers put in place under the old regime were not going to be compatible with the new system and that there would be a period during which they would be inoperable.  That was a big shock to everybody, not least the national lottery itself.  Why it took so long for it to realise is a question that will have to be raised with it.<\/p><p> From that point on national lottery sales became a hassle in the shops.  Did it lose credibility for the lottery?  I am not sure.  Are tickets sales down?  I do not think so.  The national lottery reading last week, based on its projections for the year, is that lottery sales are up by 0.02%.  The number of outlets now licensed as lottery agents has increased by 300 under the new agreement.  In regard to whether people are no longer playing the lottery because of the recent fiascoes, the answer is that is not the case.  Jackpots are reaching the same levels as before and people are playing the lottery.  Some shops say that they are not selling as many tickets but according to the national lottery, sales have increased. <\/p><p> Another urban myth is that prizes have decreased.  The percentage of prizes is copperfastened.  That is the information from the national lottery.  We have no reason not to believe what we are being told by the national lottery.

I am glad to see it is bringing other business into shops.<\/p> <p>  What is the end game?  Why would an organisation buy a national lottery licence and then allow it to become damaged?  From a business perspective, that does not make any sense.  Why was there a need for a new terminal?  Was proper training in that regard provided?  In regard to the lack of staff, is that a savings issue?  I understand that there would be long queues when a machine breaks down and so on.  Do the contracts with the new agent differ significantly from the old ones?  Is the sales margin still worthwhile?  When the national lottery was first introduced we did not have ticket checkers.  There are many ways people can check their tickets.  Has the unavailability of ticket checkers in shops contributed to the increase in unclaimed prizes?  It was recently reported that a large sum of money had not been claimed.  Are people moving to euromillions or other foreign lotteries and are lottery agents' margins in respect of the national lottery being reduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#J00700","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":813,"content":"<p>Our margin remains at the 6% we have always enjoyed.  The contract has changed slightly but remains fair to the agent.  There are now two types of contracts in place.  A new agent is required to pay a &euro;5,000 bond.  Previously, a new agent had to pay a &euro;10,000 bond.  The second contract previously provided that an existing agent pay a deposit equal to two and a half times the average based over ten weeks but under the new contract this has been reduced to one and a half times the average over ten weeks.  The week now starts on a Sunday morning and ends on a Saturday.  While the cash flow does not remain with the store for too long, it reduces the amount on which the bond would be based.<\/p> <p>  Training in relation to the new terminals was very comprehensive.  Every agent was requested to attend one of the 17 training venues.  Those who could not attend were provided with one-on-one training by lottery representatives.  The biggest problem when the system went live was the number of people contacting the help-desk for activation codes.  Despite all of the preparation in this regard some issues arose on the morning in question.  The national lottery had engaged with other lottery agents worldwide and knew what to expect and had extra people in place in the early days.  The real grievance was that when the crash occurred there did not appear to be enough people manning the help desk and enough information was not getting out.  The CSNA had sent a text message to all its members based on the most up-to-date information from the lottery, which was that the system was back up and running.  Unfortunately, as soon as we had done that the system crashed again.  All credibility in terms of sending out further texts was minimised at that stage.  <\/p> <p>  I have had the privilege of being a member of the lottery users council.  I know how difficult it was for the national lottery when as the numbers appeared online again, the system crashed again.  I understand that a decision was made about 4 p.m. on the day to roll-over that game to the next day, if the system and regulator so permitted.  I am privileged in that I have this information having been a member of the National Lottery Users Council.

I am Dermot Griffin, CEO of Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, the new lottery operator.  Prior to this role, I served as chief executive of An Post National Lottery Company for eight years from 2006 to 2014.  I welcome today&rsquo;s opportunity to brief the committee on the new operations of the lottery.  I would also like to outline the approach we adopted to achieve a successful transition from the previous licence.  I wish to update on our business performance to date where we have over 99% systems availability on the retail network and the central gaming systems.  We have exceeded our sales expectations to date which means increased funds for good causes.<br\/><br\/>I also want to address the recent technology and telecommunications issues which I feel were misconstrued.  I would like to take the opportunity to outline the real impact they had and corrective actions we have in progress.  To be clear, this was the largest roll-out in the 28-year history of the national lottery and the largest ever in Irish retail.<br\/><br\/>Premier Lotteries Ireland is an Irish incorporated company with a separate board made up of five directors from our shareholders, An Post and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, OTPP.  Following a competitive tender process, Premier Lotteries Ireland was awarded the licence to operate the national lottery in February 2014.  PLI commenced operation on 30 November 2014 and has operated the lottery since that date with in excess of 72 million transactions taking place on our new systems.  Since then, all 417 draws have been completed successfully.<br\/><br\/>We believe that PLI represents the best in lottery expertise globally and is uniquely positioned to grow the lottery in a responsible manner over the coming 20 years for the benefit of future generations in Ireland.  As with any lottery of a similar size and scale, there are a number of technological, operational and logistical complexities to its successful running.  To support PLI with the running of the lottery, we have five suppliers in place.  Intralot<b><\/b>is the lottery system technology partner of PLI.  Intralot provides the set-up, maintenance and support of new lottery software platforms and shop terminals.  Intralot is one of the top three lottery technology providers worldwide and we believe the right supplier for the Irish market.  Intralot is the first international vendor in the gaming sector that has been certified according to the World Lottery Association security control standard and the highest standards of the industry.  Intralot technology is used in 57 jurisdictions worldwide.<\/p><p>Camelot Global worked with the national lottery and Intralot to deliver the technical and business transition programme.  Camelot Global draws on its experience from the UK, where it supports Europe&rsquo;s largest interactive lottery.  Westbase Technology is a managed telecoms provider contracting 3G services from Telef&oacute;nica-O2 Ireland, now Three, and broadband from Eircom for our retail communications network.  Pollard Banknote provides security printing services to PLI and has been the scratch card supplier to the national lottery for more than 20 years.  KPMG continues to provide independent observer services to the national lottery.  Moreover, I am supported by the existing national lottery team of more than 90 lottery professionals who have a combined experience of 1,200 years working for the lottery, many of them from the start of the business.  To date, I am pleased and proud to say the national lottery has raised in excess of &euro;4.5 billion for good causes, delivered more than &euro;7.5 billion in prizes and created more than 450 millionaires in the process.<br\/><br\/>As the former CEO of An Post National Lottery Company and CEO of PLI, I look forward to working with this group to continue to grow and build on our legacy.  PLI is regulated by the new national lottery regulator, Liam Sloyan.  We will work with Mr. Sloyan and his office to ensure the national lottery continues to operate to the highest standards in all respects.<br\/><br\/>In terms of our licence obligations, there were some key requirements which included a substantial upfront payment of &euro;405 million from the new operator to fund the new children&rsquo;s hospital and many other community projects.  Another key requirement was an ongoing annual contribution to good causes set at 65% of gross gaming revenues, which is sales minus prizes, incentivising PLI to grow the lottery and maximise returns to good causes over the 20-year licence term.  There was also a requirement to replace all core systems, ensuring that the new operator utilises the latest technology.<br\/><br\/>We heard earlier from retailer groups.  Retailers are and will remain the key point of sale for the lottery and a key objective for PLI is to grow this retail channel.  It is important, however, to address some inaccurate information and to provide some context as to the scale of what has been achieved to date in retail.  On cut-over, on 30 November 2014, PLI successfully connected almost 20,000 pieces of equipment in 3,700 retail outlets throughout the country.  All central and telecommunications systems were replaced and PLI also introduced a new website and online gaming platform.  In excess of 72 million plays have taken place on the new Intralot systems.  Some 98% of all transactions are completed within three seconds.  The network has been live 99.1% of the time and the central systems 99.97% of the time.  This was the largest technology roll-out in the history of the national lottery and the largest ever in Irish retail.<br\/><br\/>To deliver this, we co-ordinated 44 retailer briefing seminars throughout the country last September and October.  We achieved more than 90% participation, with some 3,000 retailers attending the sessions.  These sessions outlined the unique logistical challenges of this project and what to expect.  We sent our sales representatives to visit anyone who did not attend the training seminars to give them training in their stores.  At these seminars, retail agents were informed, among other issues, of the temporary non-availability of the ticket checking service for tickets sold from the new Intralot terminals.  As a matter of best practice, we have provided detailed briefs on how to operate the new technology and issued a regular newsletter, <i>Transition Times<\/i>, updating all retailers on the next steps for transition and what they need to do.  PLI also met and continues to meet its agent council, on which representatives from the two retail groups represented here today &ndash; CSNA and RGDATA &ndash; sit, as well as wider retail representatives.  Throughout transition, a dedicated project team of 50 developers and testers has been working to ensure that any technical issues are addressed as swiftly as possible.  In advance of the roll-out and during transition to date, we have undertaken rigorous system testing to ensure that all equipment is fully compliant with World Lottery Association standards.<br\/><br\/>User acceptance testing involved the execution of approximately 2,800 test cases and included performance testing of the terminal to the central system.  With regard to the supplier testing on the new terminals and related systems, data migration and interfaces, this involved the execution of more than 1,800 test cases.  As I am sure the committee will understand, this has all been an enormous undertaking.  There have been a number of temporary outages across parts of the retail network, but we remain committed to completing our transition and, from there, to growing our national lottery into the future.<br\/><br\/>I wish to address the events of 4 February, when we experienced major disruption due to a core failure on the Telef&oacute;nica Spanish network which took down the 3G telecommunications data infrastructure and affected more than 3,500 national lottery agents for several hours.  Under these circumstances and wishing that all our customers could have the opportunity to play, we made the decision to defer the draw.  The regulator was made aware of our decision.  The decision ensured that everyone won.  The players were able to purchase their tickets for the draw, retailers were able to sell their tickets and, more important, the returns to good causes were not impacted.  This was the right and only decision that could have been made.  In excess of 400,000 people bought lotto tickets on Thursday, 5 February and the draw went ahead successfully that evening with one lucky winner of the &euro;10 million jackpot.<br\/><br\/>We have received a report from Westbase Technology which outlines the problem that occurred, how the problem affected our lottery retail estate and how we can prevent this from happening again in the future.  This report and reports from other outages were sent to the regulator and we are confident we can take positive learning from the experience, put appropriate contingencies in place and prevent a reoccurrence.  Premier Lotteries Ireland has operated the national lottery for just over three months, having successfully completed 72 million transactions with over 99% system availability.  All 417 draws were completed, sales are exceeding expectations and we are ahead of plan to grow funds for good causes which benefit the whole of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss the operation of the national lottery under the new licence.  I hope the committee will understand that I will be limited at times in my presentation with respect to what I can say on specific matters.  This is because, like other regulators, I have to protect confidential and commercially sensitive information and also follow due process with respect to any review I am undertaking.<\/p> <p>  It may be useful for me to begin by giving some background information on myself and the new office of regulator of the national lottery.  My background is that I am an actuary who started his career in the private sector in the insurance and pensions industry.  I worked mainly in finance, compliance and risk management.  Prior to taking up my current role, I was chief executive of the Health Insurance Authority.  This is a statutory regulator of the private health insurance market.  The office of the regulator of the national lottery was established by the National Lottery Act 2013 and I was appointed as the first regulator on 17 November 2014.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware, and many people have referred to it already today, of the very significant contribution that the national lottery has made to society over the past 28 years.  For this period, it has been enjoyed regularly by almost half the population and occasionally by two thirds.  It has raised &euro;4.5 billion for the good causes it supports.  A new lottery regime began from 30 November 2014.  Under the new regime, the licence to operate the national lottery is held by Premier Lotteries Ireland which is responsible for operating the lottery in accordance with the legislation and the licence.  The office of the regulator has functions relating to managing the national lottery fund, overseeing and investigating the operation of the lottery, approving certain matters and enforcing compliance.  The office has funding of &euro;1.5 million per annum and sanction for ten staff.<\/p> <p>  Under the legislation, the office of the regulator carries out its functions in the manner considered most likely to ensure that there continues to be a properly run, sustainable and safe national lottery and that, subject to these requirements, funds for good causes are maximised.  A properly run lottery is one in which there are processes in place and these are adhered to in order that the national lottery functions, from televised draws to the ways players and the national lottery fund are paid sums due, are carried out with all due propriety and in accordance with the legislation and the licence.<\/p><p>Public confidence is essential to the national lottery and, accordingly, the aim of ensuring sustainability includes protecting the reputation of the lottery in order that the community continues to have confidence in it.  A safe lottery means a lottery in which the interests of participants are protected, which includes the availability of clear information for consumers, having appropriate measures in place to protect against under age and excessive play, and having fair rules and procedures for each game.  Securing the greatest possible returns to good causes includes aligning the interests of good causes with those of the operator through the licence, monitoring the performance of the operator, and ensuring the allocated funds go to the right place at the right time and in the right amounts.  I note that, under the legislation, the objective of maximising funds for good causes is subject to the other three objectives.<\/p><p> We carry out this work through the statutory powers and functions assigned to us by the Oireachtas.  I will expand briefly on our primary powers and functions and work done in the context of each since the establishment of the office.  The office of regulator is responsible for managing and controlling the national lottery fund.  Over the first three months of the new licence, &euro;48 million has been allocated to good causes, or &euro;3.7 million per week.  We are required to approve games and some other aspects of the licensee&rsquo;s operations.  Since the commencement of the new licence, there have been five requests for approvals from the licensee.  As part of the process of review, we queried the original requests and nine further submissions were received, including amended requests.  To date, of the five requests for approval, one request has been approved, one request was subsequently withdrawn and three requests are under consideration.  Under these reviews we are concerned that risks to the objectives of the regulator have been identified and are being appropriately addressed by the operator.  These objectives concern probity, sustainability, player protection and maximising funds for good causes.<\/p><p> With regard to the function of the regulator&rsquo;s office to oversee PLI&rsquo;s operations, this involves seeking and reviewing records and reports from the operator and reviewing these documents as well as on-site visits.  In the context of the recent operational difficulties, we have required the operator to provide full reports on the outages, detailing the issues that arose, the reasons they arose, the extent to which they have been addressed to avoid a recurrence, the length of time taken to address them, matters outstanding and how long it will take to address those matters.  A number of reports have been received and they are being reviewed.<\/p><p> Oversight of the operator also involves reviewing the systems and procedures in place as well as other aspects of its operations.  This will involve themed reviews taking place from time to time, including on-site visits.  For example, a review of the risk management systems and procedures in place at PLI against best practice standards is taking place.  The office of regulator also has enforcement powers, ranging from issuing a direction to revoking the licence and including powers in relation to financial sanctions.  The legislation provides for financial sanctions of up to &euro;500,000 through application to the High Court or up to &euro;250,000 if the operator agrees that the matter be dealt with by the regulator.<\/p><p> The committee will see that while PLI is responsible for operating the national lottery, the office of the regulator has important statutory functions, including overseeing the operation of the lottery, holding the operator to account and enforcing compliance with the licence and the legislation.  We are determined to carry out these functions diligently in order that a safe, properly run, sustainable national lottery continues to be enjoyed by the people and, subject to this, that revenues for good causes are maximised.  I hope this presentation has been useful in informing the committee on the role of the office of the regulator of the national lottery and I look forward to answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Sloyan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  This is probably the first time in the 28 years of the lottery that we have had to bring people connected with the national lottery before the committee.  This has happened as a result of the decision to privatise the lottery licence and pass it on to a new operator following a competitive tender which secured money for the State.<\/p><p>I have a question for both organisations.  On the technology side, a decision was taken to move from DSL broadband and to replace it with 3G.  I believe there is a connection with Three and the SIM card in the shops will hunt for another mobile network if there is a partnership agreement.  4G has been excluded, which is a better system than 3G.  Most people would consider going from broadband back to a wireless system to be a retrograde step.  Premier Lotteries Ireland is the first business of which I have heard that is going backwards in technology rather than forward.  I can only presume that is a cost-saving measure.<\/p><p>Could the witnesses talk to me about the role of Camelot Global Services?  I understand that Camelot, which is wholly owned by the company that runs the lottery, uses satellite in the United Kingdom and only uses the 3G licence for scratch cards in the UK.  Could someone outline what the company&rsquo;s website in the UK does for it?  It was said that what happened with Telef&oacute;nica-O2 Ireland was a freak occurrence.  Could a representative of PLI outline the contingency plans in place?<\/p><p>Is the holding company of the operator&rsquo;s licence resident in Ireland for corporation tax purposes?  We raised the matter when the legislation was going through the Oireachtas.  I tabled a specific amendment to the effect that the operator should be resident in the State, but the Minister rejected it.  What is the residency status of the company to which the profits accrue?  In what jurisdiction is it subject to corporation tax?<\/p><p>What is the situation regarding unclaimed prizes?  I recently heard it suggested that there was change in the licence clause to allow the operator to hold on to some of the unclaimed prizes.  If that is the case, the operator might have a vested interest in unclaimed prizes, which could amount to hundreds of millions over the 20-year lifespan of the licence.<\/p><p>It was said that the company wants to increase online business from 3% to 18%.  What is the minimum price at which people can purchase tickets?  I have received correspondence from people who are dissatisfied with the new approach to accounts and the priorities in that regard.<\/p><p>I will ask all of my questions now because I know other speakers will wish to speak.  If there is insufficient time for all the information to be put on the record, it can be sent by way of correspondence in a few days time.<\/p><p>Mr. Sloyan is also welcome to the meeting.  Could he tell us about his powers and sanctions as they seem very light?  I am concerned about what I have heard.  It appears that the lottery does its business and if something goes wrong, the regulator will ask for a report.  That does not sound very proactive.  In the past ten to 15 years the country has been bedevilled by regulators who have been at best asleep at the wheel.  I hope Mr. Sloyan is at least in the car.  Given what he said, I am concerned because his role seems to be to ask for a report if something goes wrong.  What was Mr. Sloyan&rsquo;s role on the day the major draw was cancelled?  Did he sanction the decision?  Can the operator cancel a draw without reference to the regulator?  Was he notified after the decision was made?  Whose call was it to cancel the draw?  What was Mr. Sloyan&rsquo;s involvement?  Could he outline the ability of his staff to be in a position to manage and regulate an organisation which has a turnover of &euro;1 billion?<\/p><p>My next question to the regulator relates to section 24 of the legislation, which deals with the levy.  The regulator sends a bill to the operator each year and it pays a levy.  To me, that means the regulator&rsquo;s office is a little bit subservient.  I do not mean that in a personal way but in the sense that, in simple English, the operator pays the wages of the regulator.  I consider the office of the regulator to be in a compromised position.  Section 28 states &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsection (3)<\/i>, the Regulator shall publish details of a licence or a code of practice&quot;.  Has the regulator published the licence and, if not, how soon will he do it?  I understand subsection (3) deals with matters of commercial sensitivity.  That is a standard procedure.  Given that the organisation has a monopoly for the next 20 years, no competition issues arise in terms of commercial sensitivity.  We asked for the regulator&rsquo;s office to be included under freedom of information legislation but the Minister did not accept the amendment on the basis that the freedom of information legislation he introduced last year captures all new organisations.<\/p><p>Is the regulator subject to the Freedom of Information Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#M00200","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":831,"content":"<p>I will address the questions on the telecommunications contract.  We set out our requirements for modern telecommunications, and what we wanted was a telecommunications service that was fit for purpose in a modern network.  In the past, we had issues with the DSL broadband network, and local outages occurred where a wire or cable was cut and agents in the locality went down.  A physical repair is needed to restore this type of outage.  While there have not been any national issues with the broadband service, local issues arise with it.  We set out our requirements, went to tender and received a number of tenders.  We used a specialist telecommunications consultant company, Analysys Mason, to assist us with the evaluation of the tenders.  We have a very modern and advanced telecoms solution based on a roaming SIM card.  What this means is that when these roaming SIM cards are installed in the retail terminals, it gives us the ability to utilise all the Irish mobile phone networks - Vodafone, O2 Ireland, Three and Meteor.  We can then choose the strongest signal.  This gives us a very high percentage coverage on the 3G network.  We also have DSL broadband in the mix, because 3G is not available in certain locations and broadband is a better solution than 3G at certain sites.  This has been implemented in the network.  Over time, we will optimise the two technologies to ensure that where a site does not perform well on one or other of them, we can move to the second option, or, as coverage improves or broadband is rolled out further, we can optimise our telecommunications network.<\/p> <p>  The solution, the programme provided by Telef&oacute;nica Spain, is utilised by 1,500 different corporate customers, including Sony, Amazon, Volkswagen and Garmin.  As such, major international multinational companies use this solution for machine-to-machine communications.  Over time, we intend to migrate the technology we have adopted to 4G, which is, as Deputy Fleming noted, the way to go.  We took the view that current coverage was not sufficient to give us enough capability to cover an adequate area of the country.  The solution we chose has the ability to evolve into a 4G solution over the lifetime of the licence.  We view this matter from the perspective of the long-term licence and not only in the short term.  <\/p> <p>  That is the background to the decision to go with 3G.  For the information of members, we also have a limited number of satellite outlets in locations where broadband and 3G are not available.  Satellites also have problems, as planning permission is required and other matters must be dealt with.  Based on our evaluation, the best technology for us was a mix of 3G and some broadband.<\/p> <p>  On the role of Camelot Global Services Ireland, this operation has been provided to assist in the technical operation.  It is a team that will assist on the helpdesk side dealing with the agents, and is headed up by a former employee of Eircom.  As a specialist team, it will operate the technical side and helpdesk and assist us online.  It will also be able to tap into our sister Camelot company in the United Kingdom to adopt best practice and avail of economies of scale in online games and so forth.  <\/p> <p>  Westbase Technology is a telecommunications management provider which won the contract for the 3G and broadband service.  It manages the network for us.  Given that our competency is not in telecommunications, we contracted this end of the business to Westbase Technology, which will manage it on our behalf.  <\/p> <p>  On the registration of Premier Lotteries Ireland, we are an Irish-incorporated company, which means we will pay Irish corporation tax and all other taxes. <\/p> <p>  The requirement on unclaimed prizes is that they be utilised for the promotion of the national lottery.  This means, for example, that it can be used when we do top-ups and specials.  In the past, we have sponsored the fireworks for St. Patrick's Day.  It will be for that sort of activity.<\/p> <p>  I believe the Deputy asked what would be the minimum price point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I was referring to the minimum online purchasing cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#N00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":833,"content":"<p>A lotto or EuroMillions ticket is the same price online as it is in a retail outlet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":834,"content":"<p>What is the minimum price for the online games?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#N00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":835,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time has concluded.

Why did the national lottery release on the network new technology which is clearly unreliable and vulnerable to breakdown, and do so without any backup in place?  Should the technology not have been properly tested before going live?  Why was there such a hurry to rush out the new national lottery terminals without first ensuring the ticket self-scanners were functioning?  Does the national lottery accept that the decision to roll out the machines without putting scanners in place was a mistake?  Most customers believe it was a fundamental error.  When will each shop have a ticket self-scanner?<\/p> <p>  Retailers have complained about poor customer service from the national lottery, and this is adding to their frustration because they bear the brunt of customer anger.  Why has there been such a deterioration in service since the switch-over to the new operator?  Where are the customer services operations based?  Have they been outsourced? <\/p> <p>  There are two elements to complaints about the national lottery in recent months, namely, the deterioration in the technology offering underpinning the service and the lapse in communications with customers and retailers.  Why is the new technology offering creating so many problems?  The lottery operated for 26 years without one outage, yet in the three months since the new technology was introduced, we have had at least three breakdowns, including one postponed draw.  There is clearly a problem.  What is it?  The outage on 3 February last was allegedly caused by a snowstorm in Spain.  How could a snowstorm in Spain cause a lottery terminal in Killarney to no longer function? <\/p> <p>  It has been suggested that the new operator has cut back on costs as part of a measure to recoup the &euro;405 million it paid for the lottery licence.  Are the technology costs associated with the new national lottery operator lower than those incurred by the previous operator?  Is the national lottery planning to increase the price of playing the lotto or add new numbers to the prize draw?  If so, when will such changes take place?<\/p> <p>  Did the national lottery seek the approval of the lottery regulator before postponing the draw on 3 February?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#N00700","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":837,"content":"<p>Would the Senator like answers to his questions today, or would he like them to be provided after the meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#N00800","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I will take them as soon as I can get them.

I will give an outline of what was involved in the changeover.  The challenge the national lottery faced, which no other business faces, is that it operates with particular technology and systems and processes and, overnight, had to switch over to new technology and systems and keep the business running right through to operate a draw that evening.  We had to run the An Post national lottery company up to 29 November, when we had a lotto draw.  On Sunday 30 November we had to turn on new systems, a new Internet system and a new website, and take ticket sales from 8.15 that morning.  We had to do this with the assistance of our agents, who had a great deal to do.  We had to take all the An Post national lottery company scratch cards out of the retail network and load in new scratch cards and sell them.  We held our first draw, our Daily Million draw, on that Sunday night.  We did that successfully.<\/p> <p>  A requirement of the licence was to ensure that for 90 days from the ending of the An Post national lottery company we had a facility to allow players claim any outstanding prizes they had on their An Post national lottery company tickets and claim them in the retail network for a further 90 days.  We had to install the new systems and co-locate them in retail outlets with the existing system.  There is limited space in a typical retail outlet.  We had to put in plinths to make it possible for the agent to use one machine to cash prizes from the old licence and a new machine to produce tickets and validate payments from the new licence.  That is a big logistical exercise, hence the 20,000 pieces of equipment that had to be co-ordinated.  To facilitate the claiming of prizes, the ticket checkers, which are independent pieces of equipment, were connected to the old GTech terminals.  We had to facilitate the payments by leaving them in place.<\/p> <p>  Another challenge we faced in the transition - this was clear from the retailers, and we took it on board - was that the Christmas period is the most important time for retailers, and we had to minimise any disruption to our retailers over that Christmas period.  That is why we placed so much emphasis on the planning and training, and we involved the agent council in that because we knew it was a big exercise.  After 90 days of that new operation, we have completed 72 million transactions successfully.  The systems have been available more than 99% of the time.  We then had to collect the old An Post national lottery company scratch cards.  We have collected millions of them and had to decommission them and credit the agents.<\/p> <p>  Over the past few months the management and staff of the national lottery have been, in effect, running down one company and running another one.  We flagged up in advance that this would be a challenging period.  No other business would change all its systems overnight.  They might change the terminal and then separately change the mainframe and then the telecommunications.  The requirement of the licence was to change everything in one go.  We achieved that.  There have been some outages, and some of these were out of our control because the Telef&oacute;nica network in Spain fell over and brought down its backup.  That was a once-in-a-lifetime event.  Companies such as Sony and Amazon do not use a service such as that if it is not reliable and dependable.  A storm affected the network there.  It brought down the link between the primary system and the backup system in Spain and, in the attempt to re-route traffic so that the backup would still be in place, an erroneous code was sent to the primary system, which brought that down too.  That was the problem in Spain, a really rare event for a big telecommunications operator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":847,"content":"<p>Can I ask the regulator a few questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#O00800","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":848,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#O00900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Before the witnesses appeared before the committee, Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, CSNA, and the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association, RGDATA, came in.

There had been 2,800 test cases and 1,800 supplier tests before we cut over.  What is key from my point of view is that the core gaming system has not been compromised in any way.  We introduced the gaming system and have a separate gaming system off site.  We run both systems in duplicate and also have an independent control system that takes the transactions from the terminals separately.  It gives us a separate control system against which to cross check the central system.  We must ensure they are in balance, to the cent, before we have the draw.  We spent a great deal of time in making sure all of these controls were in place.  Also, our EuroMillions partners had to conduct tests on our system because we utilise our system for entries in the EuroMillions system.  They sent an IT team to carry out their checks on our system before we cut over.

We certainly ask for reports when things go wrong.  However, we do not just leave it at that.  The reports we receive are reviewed and we go back to ensure whatever went wrong is being addressed properly.<\/p> <p>  Outside that area, there are some reviews we carry out on our own intiative such as the review currently taking place of the risk management processes and structures within PLI, which I consider to be proactive.  We also look rigorously at requests for approvals that we receive from the operator.  When we receive these requests, we make sure they address the issues we must have addressed.  At times amendments are required to address these issues.  I assure the committee that we are proactive in our work.<\/p> <p>  Another question was about our involvement in the decision to postpone the draw.  The rules for the lotto provide for the operator postponing the draw in given circumstances and these circumstances arose on that day.  As such, it was a decision purely for the operator under the rules that had been approved and the operator made that decision.  I was informed beforehand, but the decision was the operator's.<\/p> <p>  Regarding whether I think the regulator is adequately resourced, we have an income of &euro;1.5 million per annum and resources for ten staff.  I consider this to be adequate.  If my views change at any time I will bring this to the attention of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  There was a suggestion that because the levy came from the operator, it might compromise the office in some way.  I do not accept this.  The net ticket sale receipts are transferred to the lottery fund.  At that point it is under my control and I take out the levy.  There is no question of PLI deciding that it does not like how I do my job and that it will not pay me this quarter or month.  There is no question of any element of compromise.<\/p> <p>  On publication of the licence, this is important.  It is something on which we are focused and to which we will be turning shortly.

It is a very successful programme that has stood the test of time.  The game show is an important property for us and will remain so but we need to look at new games as well.  Working in conjunction with RTE, we devised \"The Million Euro Challenge\".  It is a different type of game and is probably targeted at a slightly different audience level.  In terms of the excitement of TV, it is built around producing a millionaire and features slightly more complicated games than simplistic games.  It has a new presenter and a new set.  We decided with RTE that we would start the year with \"The Million Euro Challenge\".  For a programme that is just starting off, it has audiences of over 264,000 on a Saturday night.  It is certainly the top programme in its slot compared to other programmes on at that time.  We will run that for a series and bring back \"Winning Streak\" in the summer.  \"Winning Streak\" will come back afresh and we will then be able to offer a new combination of game shows.  We have done that in the past.  We have had \"Fame and Fortune\", \"Trump Card\" and \"Big Money\".  One just mixes it around a bit and refreshes things as one goes along.  Rest assured that \"Winning Streak\" will be back with Marty Whelan.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the relationship with our agents and retailers, the Deputy put her finger on it when she mentioned change.  It is a period of change for the national lottery.  Things are different, particularly over the past three months.  We have flagged and communicated this.  It is a period during which they must operate two systems.  They must run down the old An Post system and run the new system.  There have been some teething problems which we will get over.  I think the business demonstrates that the systems work 99% of the time and we will improve on that.  The relationship will more forward quite quickly, as it has done in the past, because we will sit down with our retailers and work through any outstanding issues they may have.  The ticket checkers will be out in early April and I think it will get back to business as usual for the national lottery quite quickly, which is what we want to do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1426083300,"counter":995,"content":"<p>The delegation is very welcome.

It was not just a fall of snow in Spain; something else must also have happened.<\/p> <p>  My questions are for the regulator as much as for Premier Lotteries Ireland.  Is there a problem with the system itself or somewhere else that we should know about?  I will not get into the other arguments that have been made because I am sure if I gave the witnesses sufficient time to respond they could debunk all of them but nobody has yet explained to me why we had three outages and what has gone wrong.  What are we going to do about it in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#V00300","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>We have put together a technical summary of the outages which outlines the causes.  Some were related in terms of telecommunications issues but others were not.  We also outlined the actions we have taken and the preventative steps we intend to take to ensure it will not happen again.  The issue pertaining to Telef&oacute;nica in Spain, which received extensive coverage and which required us to defer the draw, was a highly unusual event affecting 1,500 corporate customers around the world.  It is highly unlikely to recur.  Having said that, measures have already been put in place by Telef&oacute;nica to build resilience against such problems.  This system has been available 99.1% of the time.<\/p> <p>  There was a Meteor outage arising from a problem on the Meteor network.  Approximately 800 sites were on the Meteor network at that stage.  The roaming solution allowed us to move these sites from the Meteor network to other networks.  We were successful in doing that but there are lessons from the outage in the sense that we can improve the time it takes us to move from a network that has gone down to a new network.  We have put in an additional feature whereby the lottery terminal will send a signal every three minutes to confirm that it is connected to the host system.  If it finds it is not connected it will automatically switch to another network.  This means that if one network goes down we can switch quickly to other mobile networks to reestablish the service.  Even under the old system we needed to continually test back-up facilities and resilience.  We will continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015031100002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Griffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426083300,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>The technical summary and what Mr. Griffin has said reflects the reports that were submitted to me.

That is very much appreciated by the Government, my Department and me.  In that context I very much welcome the opportunity to address the committee on the recent developments at the Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p> <p>  My statement will focus on the regular, formal Foreign Affairs Council meetings held in December, January and February, along with an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting also in January.  I will also look ahead to the Council meeting later this month.<\/p> <p>  I propose to address the key issues which have been discussed at the Council as follows: Ukraine, Russia, the southern neighbourhood, counter-terrorism, climate change, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ebola.  I will look ahead to the topics to be discussed at the March Council, namely, Africa, migration and the Eastern Partnership.<\/p> <p>  I understand members may wish me to refer to issues outside the Foreign Affairs Council agenda and I would be happy to do so on the basis that there are a number of issues of importance pertaining to the committee upon which I may be in a position to provide an update or indeed take the committee's advice and guidance.<\/p> <p>  In my closing I propose to update the committee briefly on the recent launch of the foreign policy review, a publication in which I know the committee has taken a strong interest.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their input in shaping the form of the final document.  I would be happy to address any questions members might have.<\/p> <p>  Since I last appeared before the committee to discuss the business of the Foreign Affairs Council, the conflict in eastern Ukraine has taken a number of turns.  The lead-up to Christmas saw a lull in fighting which raised hopes that progress could be made in the search for a sustainable political solution.  However, in January, the Russian-backed rebels launched a series of offences aimed at pushing back Ukrainian forces and seizing additional areas of territory over which to exercise control.  The intensification in fighting led to a dramatic increase in the number of casualties, particularly among the civilian population in eastern Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  In light of this rapidly deteriorating situation, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande undertook a diplomatic initiative involving President Poroschenko and President Putin.  Their efforts culminated in a summit meeting of the four leaders in Minsk on 12 February at which the parties to the conflict signed an agreement undertaking to fully implement the Minsk agreements of the previous September.  This deal provided for a ceasefire which came into effect on 14 February and committed both sides to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line.<\/p> <p>  After a troubled start, the 14 February ceasefire appears to have taken hold.  Both sides have begun withdrawing heavy weapons and prisoner exchanges have also taken place.  Despite these positive developments the situation is fragile and concerns remain in the Ukrainian Government that pro-Russian rebels are using the truce to regroup for new attacks on government positions.<\/p> <p>  The European Union has responded appropriately to these developments.  At the December Foreign Affairs Council, Ministers confirmed their agreement in principle to the imposition of additional sanctions on investment, services and trade with Crimea in a further tightening of the EU&rsquo;s policy of non-recognition of the annexation of Crimea.  These measures were endorsed by the European Council on 18 December and entered into force on 20 December.<\/p> <p>  In response to the dramatic surge in violence during January, High Representative Mogherini called an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council on 29 January at which Ministers agreed to extend the existing list of individuals and entities subject to European Union visa bans and asset freezes to September 2015.  In addition, the Council approved a proposal to work up additional listings against separatists in eastern Ukraine and their supporters in Russia which were approved at the subsequent February Council meeting, although implementation of this decision was temporarily deferred to allow space for the aforementioned diplomatic efforts that were in train at the time.<\/p> <p>  The European External Action Service and the Commission were also tasked to undertake further preparatory work on &ldquo;any appropriate action\" which may include further economic sanctions to ensure the rapid and comprehensive implementation of the September Minsk agreements.  This work is ongoing and is expected to be ready in advance of the European Council on 19 and 20 March where European Union leaders will have a detailed discussion on EU relations with Russia and the situation in Ukraine.  The question of further economic measures against Russia will be a feature of the discussion.  The conclusions of the December European Council meeting delivered a clear message that, regarding Ukraine, the EU would stay the course and stood ready to take further steps if necessary and appropriate.<\/p> <p>  The discussion on additional measures is expected to be largely influenced by developments on the ground in the period leading up to the European Council meeting and will determine the further steps the European Union will take.  While recent developments on the ceasefire, including weapons withdrawal and prisoner exchanges, are a positive sign, the true test of the accord reached on 12 February will be in its full implementation.<\/p> <p>  At the January Foreign Affairs Council meeting a strategic discussion was held on the EU&rsquo;s overall relations with Russia.  This discussion sought to look beyond the Ukraine crisis, the prism through which our relations with Russia has been almost exclusively viewed for most of the past year, and to consider areas of shared interest and potential engagement.  Ministers agreed on the advantages that lay in maintaining co-operation on important global and regional foreign policy issues such as Syria, Libya, and Iran, where engagement with Russia is considered desirable and on occasion necessary if progress is to be made in tackling these major challenges.  It was also agreed that options for sectoral dialogues with Russia could also be explored at technical level in a limited number of areas, such as energy.<\/p> <p>  Ministers, however, made it very clear that this reflection on our relations with Russia should not be interpreted as a return to business as usual and that any resumption of dialogue with Russia would be selective, gradual and conditional.  There was also a wide acceptance that any change in the current course of our relations with Russia could only come about if Russia altered its behaviour towards Ukraine and fully implemented its commitments under the September Minsk agreements.<\/p> <p>  I wish now to turn to the southern neighbourhood.  At the December Council meeting the Council was joined by the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General for the Syria crisis, Mr. Staffan di Mistura, who outlined his proposals on a graduated de-escalation of the conflict.  Ministers gave him full support in his efforts and discussed possible EU measures to support implementation of his plan.  Conclusions were also adopted which made public full EU backing for his plan.<\/p> <p>  We also reiterated the European Union&rsquo;s support for a political end to the conflict based on the Geneva principles, condemned regime and terrorist atrocities and crimes against civilians, urged full compliance by Syria with the chemical weapons convention, and called for all parties to respect and implement international humanitarian law and UN Security Council resolutions 2139 and 2165.  The conclusions also pledged the European Union&rsquo;s continued support for humanitarian efforts for the victims of the conflict and committed the European Union to supporting Syria&rsquo;s neighbours in meeting the exceptional challenges posed by the massive inflow of refugees fleeing the violence in Syria.<\/p> <p>  The February Foreign Affairs Council also took note of a proposed European Commission communication on a regional strategy for Syria and Iraq, which it is expected will be formally adopted at our next Council meeting in March.<\/p><p>We also discussed the political and security crisis in Yemen in light of the 22 January resignation of President Hadi, along with Prime Minister Bahah and his Cabinet.  We adopted conclusions which expressed deep concern about terrorist attacks and violent incidents and urged all parties in Yemen to work towards a political framework through which the legitimate aspirations of the Yemeni people can be attained and realised.<\/p><p> Libya is another country paralysed by a political and security crisis, and it was discussed at the February Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  We agreed conclusions which welcomed the convening of the United Nations-facilitated political dialogue and underlined our continuing support for the efforts of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, UNSMIL.  We restated our view that there is no military solution to the Libyan crisis.  Only a political settlement can achieve peace and stability for Libya and its people.  The situation in Libya is expected to feature again at the March Foreign Affairs Council meeting, when we will review the situation and assess the progress of the United Nations-facilitated talks.<\/p><p> There has been a renewed and necessary focus on counter-terrorism in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris and more recently in Copenhagen.  The January Foreign Affairs Council saw Ministers reiterate the need to co-ordinate internal and external measures and to step up efforts to prevent and counter the threat from international terrorism.  Internal strategies are the preserve of the Minister for Justice and Equality and her counterparts, while foreign Ministers take the lead on external measures.  In that regard I have had a number of meetings with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in order to ensure that matters internally and externally are co-ordinated in an appropriate manner.<\/p><p> The January Foreign Affairs Council also reaffirmed the need to intensify and accelerate implementation of the EU&rsquo;s counter-terrorism and foreign fighters strategy on Syria and Iraq, which was agreed on 20 October 2014.  This strategy is an integral contribution to the international effort to tackle the threat emanating from ISIL.  It is one element of our wider foreign and security policy approach towards both Iraq and Syria which is situated within the larger political and regional context and includes support to the moderate Syrian opposition, while working with Iraq to ensure a more inclusive system of governance and addressing the humanitarian crisis.<\/p><p> Discussion on these issues continued at the February Foreign Affairs Council, at which Council conclusions were agreed, including on the need to mainstream counter-terrorism into foreign policy in full compliance with international law, fundamental values and international human rights standards.  Measures envisaged within this framework include enhanced co-operation with and support for capacity-building in third countries to prevent radicalisation, the promotion of a counter narrative and the strengthening of legal and security measures, as well as a recognition of the need to address underlying factors, in particular the ongoing conflicts in Europe's southern neighbourhood.<\/p><p> The issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina was discussed at the December Foreign Affairs Council meeting following a visit to Bosnia by High Representative Mogherini and the European Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement, Johannes Hahn.  During this visit, they met senior politicians and representatives of civil society in Bosnia to discuss ways of injecting new momentum into the stalled reform process in order to help Bosnia advance on its EU accession path.<\/p><p> The Council agreed conclusions which called on Bosnia&rsquo;s leaders to make a written commitment on a reform agenda.  This includes socio-economic reforms such as the 2013 compact for growth and jobs as well as reforms relating to the rule of law and good governance.  This agenda also aims to address functionality issues, including the EU co-ordination mechanism, and the implementation of the 2009 Sedjic-Finci ruling of the European Court of Human Rights.  Upon receipt of the written commitment, the Foreign Affairs Council will then decide on the entry into force of Bosnia&rsquo;s stabilisation and association agreement with the EU.  Following meaningful progress on the implementation of this reform agenda, Bosnia&rsquo;s application to join the European Union would then be further considered.<\/p><p> In response, on 29 January, Bosnia&rsquo;s tripartite presidency agreed and signed a joint declaration expressing their readiness to pursue the EU reform agenda.  Bosnia&rsquo;s Parliament endorsed the declaration on 23 February.  High Representative Mogherini attended the session and welcomed the move as \"a historical moment and a starting point\" for the key issue of implementing reforms.  Bosnia and Herzegovina will be discussed again by the Foreign Affairs Council in the near future to decide on the next steps, including the entry into force of Bosnia&rsquo;s stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union.  Ireland has long been a strong supporter of Bosnia and Herzegovina and I look forward to further reports on developments of a positive nature from High Representative Mogherini in that regard.<\/p><p> Ebola was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in December.  With the support of the international community, the efforts of the three countries most affected by Ebola - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - are finally beginning to show progress as transmission rates for this terrible disease show an overall rate of decline.  Ireland has played a full role in the international response to the crisis through the work on the ground of our embassy in Sierra Leone, our significant financial support and the active and positive contribution of our non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  It is important, however, that we see the crisis through to the end.  We have the strategies to defeat Ebola and we need to focus on and implement them until the job has been completed to the satisfaction of everyone in the region and beyond.  To do so, we must ensure we maintain the high level of resources which have been built up in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  That will be particularly important for Sierra Leone where transmission rates have, regrettably, begun to rise again.<\/p><p> A high-level international conference on Ebola was held in Brussels on 3 March.  This focused both on short-term needs and on longer-term recovery and development.  Ireland was represented by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  The European Union and its member states have so far committed more than &euro;1.2 billion to the Ebola response.  In 2014, Ireland provided more than &euro;18 million, directly and through NGOs, to the most affected countries.  This included &euro;10 million through our annual development programmes in our partner countries, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have a particular focus on strengthening their national health systems.  We have provided more than &euro;5.6 million specifically for Ebola treatment facilities and for work on contact tracing, community mobilisation and child nutrition programmes, among other activities.  We will maintain this strong focus throughout 2015.<\/p><p> Climate change was discussed at the January Foreign Affairs Council.  As The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World highlights, climate change is one of the biggest global challenges of this century and demands a co-ordinated response at both national and international level.  We are now at an important juncture in the run-up to the conference of parties of the United Nations framework convention on climate change taking place in Paris at the end of this year.  At the Foreign Affairs Council in January, I joined my fellow Ministers in adopting an EU action plan for climate diplomacy which will use the collective leverage of member states and the EU institutions to work towards an ambitious climate change agreement in Paris this December.  In support of the action plan for climate diplomacy, Ireland will prioritise engagement with the least developed countries through our mission network.  We will also continue to support the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Climate Change, our own Mary Robinson, in her outreach to countries before the Paris negotiations.  If you did not have an opportunity already, Chairman, I hope you will invite Mrs. Robinson to join the committee in its discussions on this important issue.<\/p><p> The March Foreign Affairs Council, at which Ireland will be represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will see a strategic discussion on EU relations with Africa, which I very much welcome.  It is my hope that this discussion will go beyond the traditional narratives of security and development aid and also address the interlinked issues of peace, prosperity and partnerships.  Sustainable prosperity will not be achieved without peace, and peace itself is best achieved through partnerships that achieve a shared prosperity.  Ireland has already taken steps to better integrate our political, development and economic relations with Africa through the Africa Strategy, launched in 2011.  The strategy recognises that the African continent is undergoing an enormous economic and social transformation with average growth rates of 5% over the past ten years.<\/p><p>However, poverty persists and inequality is growing, creating the conditions for conflict, criminality and terrorism.  Development aid alone cannot address these problems, more and better investments both public and private are required.  From all of my contacts with African Ministers and officials, one message stands out, that Africa seeks to be fully and fairly integrated into the global economy so that sustainable domestic economic growth can overcome poverty and conflict. <\/p><p> I also hope the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will have the opportunity to update our colleagues on Ireland&rsquo;s role, together with Kenya, as a co-facilitator of the post-2015 discussions at the United Nations, where both Europe and Africa have a critical role to play in ensuring that we adopt a transformative framework which can address sustainable and inclusive economic growth, eliminate global hunger and ensure a peaceful and dignified life for everybody on our planet.<\/p><p> The EU&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership policy will be discussed at the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council and European Council in preparation for the Eastern Partnership Summit which will take place in Riga, Latvia, on 21-22 May.  The summit will be an opportunity to take stock of the Eastern Partnership process, and developments since the last summit in Vilnius in 2013.  It will set the path for the partnership for the next two years.  In particular, it will be an opportunity to assess initial progress by Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in the implementation of their EU association agreements, with assistance from the European Union. <\/p><p> Members will recall that these agreements were approved by the D&aacute;il in January, after their consideration by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and a debate in the D&aacute;il.  This paves the way for their ratification by Ireland, which will be completed before the Riga Summit in May.  Once again I thank the Chairman and members of the Select Committee for their valuable contributions during our discussions on the agreements.  These agreements are fundamental for the three countries concerned because they provide a long-term and comprehensive framework for their relations with the European Union.  Their citizens will also benefit from the wide-ranging reforms which are embodied in these agreements.  The Riga Summit should also seek to confirm that the Eastern Partnership is as relevant for those partner countries that did not conclude association agreements with the European Union.  <\/p><p> In advancing the European Union&rsquo;s partnership with these eastern neighbours, the Riga Summit should convey clearly the important message that the Eastern Partnership is not directed against any third parties nor does it seek to create new dividing lines in Europe.<\/p><p> The March Foreign Affairs Council is also expected to have a discussion on migration.  The ongoing tragedy in the Mediterranean, where thousands of would-be migrants to Europe have lost their lives at sea in recent years and months, highlights the importance of ensuring that the European Union integrates questions of migration and displacement into its external and development policies.  Much work has been done on developing a European Union approach to migration that recognises not only the reality that people are moving on an unprecedented scale today but also that migration has the potential to be a positive force for global development, in both rich and poor countries.  Only last week I had the opportunity to spend a day in Geneva where the matter of international migration was very much on the agenda.  I would be happy to provide the committee with a written note on my discussions in that regard at an early date.<\/p><p> Ireland is fully supportive of the European Union&rsquo;s global approach to migration and mobility and we recognise the absolute importance of addressing the challenges of migration in a spirit of partnership between receiving and sending countries.  Historically, we are a country of emigration that has only become a country of immigration in our very recent past.  We are confident that our experience, particularly our experience in engaging with communities and individuals of Irish origin abroad, can help us to make a meaningful contribution to tapping the positive potential of migration.<\/p><p> I wish to avail of the opportunity to refer briefly to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy which the Taoiseach and I launched in January.  This review entitled, The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World, is the culmination of a wide-ranging process of consultation conducted by my Department involving civil society and members of the public as well as other Departments and Members of the Oireachtas.  I believe that it offers a progressive and forward-looking vision of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and Ireland's place in the wider world.<\/p><p> The review identifies our key goals under a number of broad themes.  Through its focus on &ldquo;our people&rdquo;, the review takes stock of the ongoing work in pursuit of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland, as well as the provision of support for Irish citizens travelling, living and working abroad, our growing engagement with the Irish diaspora, and the promotion of Irish culture abroad.  In addressing &ldquo;our values&rdquo;, the review sets out Ireland&rsquo;s support for a fairer, more just, more secure and more sustainable world through our development programme, human rights policies, peacekeeping, disarmament and security policies and growing engagement with global issues such as climate change, while also considering the role of the European Union and United Nations in amplifying Ireland&rsquo;s voice and extending its influence. <\/p><p> In relation to &ldquo;our prosperity&rdquo; the review considers the global economic background to the ongoing efforts in support of recovery, growth and job creation, in particular through trade, tourism, education, investment and the enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad.  It is a good story that we need to tell and tell in a positive manner.  The review also considers the fundamental importance for Ireland of our place in Europe and how the Government engages across the broad agenda of EU decision-making to safeguard and promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests and to shape the European Union and its ongoing global engagement. <\/p><p>In addition, it considers how Ireland can use its influence and leverage the resources available to secure the maximum benefit for the Irish people from Ireland&rsquo;s international engagement.  It sets out the context for the Government&rsquo;s international engagement, and in particular the work of my Department and of Ireland&rsquo;s embassy network, 80 missions abroad, in the years ahead, all actively pursuing a positive agenda now in the years ahead.<\/p><p> The Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Niall Burgess, may meet with the committee in the near future, with the permission of the Chairman, to discuss the process leading to the &ldquo;The Global Island&rdquo; policy document.  My primary concern of course is to ensure that the review is followed by concrete actions in the form of implementation in each of the five aforementioned strands.  Some such actions are already under way.  Last month I announced plans for a new passport card which will mark a significant enhancement for Irish citizens travelling overseas.  <\/p><p> Last week I joined with the Taoiseach, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, in launching the first ever comprehensive policy for engagement with our diaspora.  Work on further practical measures is ongoing and I would welcome a future opportunity to brief the committee on these issues at some point in the near future.  <\/p><p> In the meantime I take this opportunity to thank the committee for its engagement with the development of the foreign policy review and for the considerable inputs it has provided.  I always welcome the committee's views, input, advice, guidance and contribution.  <\/p><p>I am happy to address any questions Members may have and look forward to hearing their own perspectives on these issues and others which they might wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#B00200","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for such a comprehensive report on issues at home and abroad.

Her appearance before the committee will be very important as she was on the ground with all the main players looking at it first hand.<\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to Deputy Brendan Smith, I ask the Minister to give the committee an up date on the situation of Mr. Ibrahim Halawa, a matter in which the committee has taken a keen interest and which will probably be raised by all Members.  I met the Egyptian charg&eacute; d'affaires yesterday.  He is prohibited from giving an update on the welfare of Mr. Halawa given that Mr. Halawa is an Irish citizen.

I thank the Chair and acknowledge the role of this committee in respect of its sustained interest and constructive engagement on the matter.  Since the committee's last briefing on the case, I met last week in Geneva with the Egyptian deputy foreign Minister.  I emphasised Ireland's continued concerns regarding the detention of Mr. Halawa.  Minister Badr undertook to convey the Irish position to his Government, which he duly did.  I am also due to speak again with foreign Minister Shoukry and I will take the opportunity to stress Ireland's ongoing concerns on this case.  I met with Minister Shoukry personally on two occasions and spoke to him directly on the phone with others with the Halawa family on 12 February.  My officials remain in ongoing contact with him and had a meeting with him as recently as 26 February.<\/p> <p>  Embassy officials in Cairo met with Mr. Halawa most recently last Sunday.  It remains unclear whether the Egyptian authorities regard Ibrahim Halawa as eligible for release under the recently-announced presidential decree.  Contacts are ongoing with the Egyptian authorities on this important point.  Our ambassador in Cairo recently met with the Egyptian Prosecutor General to discuss this case and we are informed that the Office of the Prosecutor General is currently examining an application made under the presidential decree.  While it must be stressed that this is only one of many ongoing and difficult consular cases in my Department, one of more than 1,600 that we dealt with last year, I assure the committee that this case and the ongoing detention of Ibrahim Halawa is a priority for me and my Department.  However, it is a particularly complex case.  As the Chair will appreciate given his own international engagement and travel, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I simply cannot get Irish citizens released from foreign prisons.  The decision is for the Egyptians to make, but I can certainly influence and advocate and this is a case I have been making over many months.  It is an exceptional case and I will continue to ensure sustained high-level contacts with the Egyptian authorities.  We will continue to take all appropriate action to ensure the release of Ibrahim Halawa and in the meantime to ensure his health and welfare are adequately catered for.  We are seeking a review of the case.  I am seeking his release.  I am seeking a return of Ibrahim Halawa to Dublin, to his studies, to his place of education and to his family.  I am happy to continue to highlight the case in every way possible.  I acknowledge the Chairman's recent initiative and thank him for his own contribution in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Comparisons have been made to an international case involving a journalist.  Some unfair comparisons have been made.  Direct comparisons cannot be made between how the Egyptians acted in the case of Peter Greste and how they will act in the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  Mr. Greste did not have Egyptian citizenship.  He had already been sentenced at the time he was released: his case had taken place, due process had been facilitated and the sentence had been handed down.  In this case, however unacceptable it might be, we are still awaiting trial, although charges have been laid.  It should also be noted that the type of charges Mr. Greste faced were fundamentally different from those faced by Ibrahim Halawa.  Having made that comparison, I assure the Chairman that we will continue at every level to prioritise this case and call for this man's return.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#E00100","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed outline of the issues discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council.  With regard to the Ebola outbreak, I want to put on the record our recognition of the important role played by officials in the Minister's Department and by Irish NGOs.  Both Ireland and the EU have been substantial donors in regard to dealing with this outbreak.  Does the Minister know what percentage of the pledges made by the international community have been honoured or realised to date in this fight against Ebola?  Similarly, what percentage of such pledges of humanitarian aid for Syria has been honoured?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred, understandably, to the terrorist attacks in Paris and elsewhere.  It is important that the European Union gives out a clear message that we will not allow terrorist attacks to undermine our commitment and our resolve to guarantee freedom of speech and all liberties associated with liberal democracies.  Member states of the EU must be very clear and must do all they can to resist political and religious extremism in all its forms, whether it comes in the guise of far-left or far-right policies or from people of whatever belief.<\/p> <p>  We spoke at this committee previously about the need for a better working-out of the Eastern Partnership.  The Minister referred in his contribution to consideration being given to the overall relations with Russia.  Does the Minister think an escalation or a lessening of the sanctions against Russia is being considered in the short term?  It is important that the European Union has a united response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine.  Initially, the European Union response was all over the place.  The High Representative was going to table a plan to normalise working relations.  That was not appropriate and better counsel prevailed in the European Commission and at the council.  We should also recognise that it is the far left and far right who are the loudest voices against sanctions and in defence of Russia.  It is important that we also recognise that there is a threat to the European Union from a neighbouring state that clearly has a policy of trying to undermine not only those who aspire to European Union membership but also some current member states.  As a country that fought so long for independence and that holds dearly the idea of sovereignty,  Ireland should stand strong and united against the bullying and neo-imperialist behaviour shown by Russia.  There are many other EU member states with very chequered histories on self-determination which would share our view.  As a country, we should be strong in that opinion because it comes from our experience of a hard struggle to win independence.  We also suffered from an imposed partition, so we should appreciate the difficulties and the reprehensible behaviour of any major state in annexing part of another country.<\/p> <p>  The Minister did not mention the Middle East in his contribution.  I welcome his visit to the region and some of the commentary attributed to him while he was there.  When he was in Israel, he said the EU needed to up its game in regard to the Middle East peace process.  Does he intend to bring forward at forthcoming council meetings specific measures that he thinks could help to advance the proposed peace process for that region?  He will have seen at first hand the significant effects of the blockade on Gaza on the people of that area.  The humanitarian crisis has been exacerbated by the continuation of that blockade.  Some months ago the Minister attended a conference at which he made a commitment on behalf of the Irish people in regard to some very substantial funds towards the rebuilding of Gaza.<\/p><p>My understanding is this rebuilding has not commenced and that the humanitarian aid pledged is not reaching the places where it is needed.  I read some commentary recently that at the rate the building materials were reaching Gaza, it would take more than 100 years to carry out the rebuilding programme.  Surely that is utterly reprehensible.  If the international community is serious about helping people affected by huge humanitarian disasters to live normal lives, if at all possible, it must find the means to honour pledges when they are made to improve the lives of people in affected areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#E00200","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his address and, in particular, compliment him on the launch of the foreign policy review, to which the committee contributed.  I have no doubt that it will set a very useful benchmark for Irish foreign policy.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure whether the European Union is sufficiently respected for its genuine interest in neighbourhood countries such as Ukraine.  It appears Russia has taken the attitude that it will ignore the views of the Union and the United Nations and any other commentary and is hellbent on pursuing its own objectives, whatever they may be.  We have read in recent times about allegations about Russian aircraft flying in airspace close to our territory.  To what extent is the European Union conscious of what appears to be another Cold War developing?  Have adequate steps been taken to address these issues?  What steps can be taken to address them other than by imposing sanctions?  How successful are sanctions likely to be?  Will they lead to the Russian authorities becoming even more determined?  It is fair to say they are certainly not in pursuit of democracy.  The point I am emphasising is that the European Union has a huge population, as does Russia, but the diplomatic influence of and weight of opinion within the Union are not sufficiently respected, certainly not by the Russians.  <\/p> <p>  The situation in the Middle East has been referred to.  It is sad to see that the peace process has stalled.  As far as I can see, there is no chance of anything happening.  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, has referred to the rebuilding programme in Gaza, but it is never likely to succeed because it will take at least 20 years to complete, given the current rate of progress.  The question then arises as to the extent to which the European Union can influence the Israeli authorities with a view to trying to establish some normal relations and a peace process in which the various bodies involved can make their case and have it dealt with.<\/p> <p>  My next point concerns the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I am glad to note that some attention has been paid to this issue in recent times.  When attention is divided, as is the case throughout Europe, there are many competing issues, one of which is the possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, which is a distraction.  Another is the wars in several countries surrounding Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The international environment in which the European Union plays a major role is another issue to be examined.  All of these issues are distractions that divert attention from the very important matter of what is happening internally in the European Union, particularly in the western Balkans.  Will the Minister tell me whether it is recognised that it is necessary to continue to concentrate on ensuring the European Union we thought we knew we had in recent times is still being pursued as an objective and whether we can look forward to some progress being made in that regard?<\/p> <p>  My next point concerns the situation in Africa.  I do not know whether we are achieving any progress in a series of wars which have resulted in hardship, genocide and starvation.  I refer, in particular, to the activities of Boko Haram in Nigeria and the extent to which it seems to have total disregard for opinion worldwide.  Global opinion does not count.  We hear about young women being captured and imprisoned and it seems no action can deter this activity, which is an outrage in the modern world and a global community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#F00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome his statement on Ibrahim Halawa, which was very forthright.  He said he would continue to advocate and try to influence circumstances to bring about his release, which was a priority for his Department.  Again, I express our collective thanks to the Irish Embassy in Cairo for its interest and advocacy on behalf of Mr. Halawa.  The Minister says the eligibility of Mr. Halawa for release under a presidential decree is unclear.  When will the position become a little clearer?  I have a difficulty about the system of due process in Egypt.  I do not think people get a fair trial when there is a mass trial, but I am not expecting the Minister to respond to this.  However, I welcome his statement and hope he will use the forthcoming meeting to inform his colleagues and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, about the case.<\/p> <p>  I raised the matter of the situation in Ukraine with the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, yesterday.  We know that the United Nations has stated 5,600 people have been killed, but the number is possibly far higher.  There is, however, potential to find a pathway to peace.  Some civic society representatives and parliamentarians visited Ireland to look at the Irish peace process.  Is there anything this committee can do in that regard?  We have said one of our priorities should be examining the situation in Ukraine.  Would it be helpful for the committee to visit the region to give an Irish perspective on how it might be possible to move forward?  One of the dangers is that military offensives in the area have always happened during the spring.  The British Government has stated it will send 76 troops to train Ukrainian personnel, while the United States has spoken about sending a battalion.  The lesson we have learned in Ireland is that we need demilitarisation of a conflict rather than militarisation.  What is the Irish position on EU countries supporting Ukraine militarily?<\/p><p>We all condemn Russia's military involvement, but direct military intervention, particularly by NATO states, is counterproductive.  I refer to a statement from the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, that the EU should establish its own army to show Russia that it is serious about defending European values.   I do not think this is helpful to the situation.  The German defence Minister stated that there would be a European army in the future.  Does the Minister agree with the wishes of Mr. Juncker, or has Ireland a different view?  During the discussion on Russia at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting, will the Minister affirm Ireland's opposition to joining any EU army?<\/p><p> I welcome the Minister's visit to Gaza and the Middle East.  Not one single house has been rebuilt.  I recently met a woman who has been traumatised by her visits to the region.  She spoke about the health situation resulting from the conflict.  For example, unknown microbes have been identified in people's bodies and people were dying from simple cuts.  She had seen people who had lost limbs who could not reach their apartments on upper floors.  The most basic elements are not available, such as electricity for the lifts or wheelchairs.  Electricity is only available for four hours a day.  There is a lack of clean water and there are food shortages.  The people have no work and there is a lack of hope.  The Minister said the EU must step up to the plate and make concrete proposals.  I ask him to outline Ireland's proposals for resolving the conflict and lifting the siege on the people of Gaza.  The main concern for many of us is that the conflict will resume.  The basic requirements such as food are not getting into Gaza.  There is nothing happening to arrive at a peace agreement on this side of the elections.  The situation in the region is getting worse.<\/p><p> The motion to recognise Palestine was passed in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Will the Minister bring this suggestion to his colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council?  I refer to the ban on goods from the illegal settlements, but these goods are coming to the EU.  In our view, such a ban could provide the potential for movement in the area.  New settlements are being proposed and constructed in the occupied territories.<\/p><p> I welcome the announcement of &euro;18 million in direct and indirect aid to be provided to deal with Ebola.  The crisis seems to be under some form of control but the big worry is food insecurity.  Is the Department monitoring this situation?  I refer to newspaper reports about food shortages resulting from the fact that people are unable to go to the fields to cultivate crops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#F00300","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1061,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I echo the remarks by other Deputies about the blockade in Gaza.  The problem in the Middle East is so intractable that it is easy to despair and for a certain ennui to set in.  We should not be blind to the situation.  I know the Minister was shocked when he visited Gaza at the nature and extent of the humanitarian crisis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will raise the issue of the blockade at European level in an effort to get the blockade eased if not lifted.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of migration in particular, because the Minister has dealt comprehensively with the majority of the issues.  The Minister referred to Africa and the importance of integrating the African countries into the global economy.  He highlighted the fact that many African countries are experiencing phenomenal growth rates but there has been an increase in the number of conflicts, in the levels of poverty and in population numbers.  The vast majority of the expected increase in population over the next 20 to 25 years will be in Africa.  Migration is a fact and it will become a more significant issue, but Europe is not dealing with it.  I refer to the daily catastrophic deaths of people who are trying to cross the Mediterranean.  Thousands of people are dying every year.  The Mare Nostrum programme has been abandoned for various reasons, partly because the burden on Italy and Malta was so great, and as a result of the British claims that the programme was in some way increasing the number of immigrants because it was saving lives.  The programme was definitely incentivising the traffickers to dump people into the sea in the expectation that they would be rescued.  For whatever reason, the programme has ceased, and it has been replaced by a more modest Frontex programme called the Trident programme.  I understand this programme only covers an area up to 30 miles from the Italian coast, so it is not comprehensive.  The result has been more deaths in the sea.<\/p> <p>  I have heard of a suggestion that may have emanated from the Commission that all European countries should share the burden and that they should use their embassies in the countries of origin or in the transit countries in Africa to process applications by asylum seekers or others.  Will this approach be discussed at the Council?  What is Ireland's view on this suggestion?  I am not sure what the approach would achieve, but it may prevent people from being drowned in the sea.  It is not a solution to migration but it may be a solution to the drownings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#G00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I was in Abuja in Nigeria.

We have a commitment to take in 300 refugees, which is much better than some other EU countries.  The EU has taken in 1000% fewer refugees than Lebanon.  Can the Minister push the EU to do more?  What is the progress on taking in the 300 refugees?<\/p> <p>  The Chairman and I visited the area of the Turkish border with Syria.  We saw extremely poor Syrian refugees.  Do those people get a look in when it comes to countries taking in refugees or are the better off or more educated people considered first?<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the humanitarian summit.<\/p><p>How are we going to ensure a role for the private sector?  Its role in western Africa and Siberia has been negligible.  Can we pursue that at the humanitarian summit?<\/p><p> At the last periodic review at the United Nations Human Rights Council on Iran, a number of recommendations regarding human rights were made.  More than 12 countries at the meeting referred to state-led pressure on the 300,000 Baha'i people in Iran.  The head of the Iranian delegation sought to make out that there were no problems for the Baha'i in Iran.  This is an issue that we brought up when we were in that country.  Independent reports tell us that there is persecution of Baha'i in Iran due to their religion, including reports from the Secretary General of the UN and the UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Iran.  I ask that Ireland pursue this matter and raise questions at the upcoming periodic review of Iran.<\/p><p> We had a recent event with the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa  on tax evasion in Africa.  We discussed a recent African Union report claiming that some &euro;60 billion is lost to African countries annually due to very pressurised lobbying by financial institutions.  Liberalised capital flows, debt conditionalities and tax breaks for multinationals are issues that are being highlighted and pursued by development campaigners, but they are way down the agenda.  I have tried to ask the Minister about this in the D&aacute;il but I keep being pushed to the Minister for Finance.  If we are talking about development aid and the effects of these tax issues for developing countries, why does the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade not have a more proactive role?  What is its role?  We talk about policy coherence, but I have to wonder - and I mean no disrespect to the Minster of State, Deputy Dara Murphy - why the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, is not attending.  If we are concerned about sustainable development, attending would have come under the latter's role, especially with the Addis Ababa conference coming up.<\/p><p> I will not repeat what other people have said but I share their concerns about Gaza, the lack of reconstruction and the continuing building of settlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#G00400","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1065,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his report.  The integrity of borders, particularly the Ukrainian border, is something Irish people strongly support, given our own sad history.  Our own borders were breached and they still are breached.  I was recently at a dinner in Dushanbe with a member of the Duma whom I know.  He provided an interesting perspective on Ukraine.  We talked about it and he agreed it was a pity the February agreement was not honoured.  It was a major mistake on the part of the EU to fail to bring much more pressure to bear once the protest morphed into anarchy and the President was overthrown, given that an election was already agreed for November.  That mistake should be acknowledged and recognised; otherwise, it will be repeated.  The member talked about his grandparents who were reared and lived near Kiev and of the connection between his family and Ukraine.  He is only one of many Russians who have a connection with Ukraine.  The connection between Ukraine and Russia raises a question as to why this whole issue was not anticipated.  There is a very close connection.  He spoke about Crimea, and I did not get any sense that Crimea will be handed back by the Russians any time soon.  That is one perspective I relate to the Minister.<\/p><p>The next perspective relates to the fact that Tajikistan has suffered economically as a consequence of the sanctions.  While I support the sanctions, as it is necessary to take some peaceful action to have issues redressed, 30% of that country's income comes from its emigrants.  Is there a recognition at EU level that many of these former Soviet states, some of which, including Tajikistan, are quite poor, are suffering as a consequence of this?  Is there an effort to at least have dialogue and see what can be done to alleviate the particular and indirect consequences for them of what is going on?<\/p><p>I refer to the displacement of 10 million Syrians, which is an alarming situation.  The Minister has been to the region, as have many members of the committee, and seen the direct consequences of displacement in refugee camps.  I noted a couple of months ago that the UN World Food Programme's food voucher scheme, directly targeting a couple of million Syrians, was suspended due to lack of funds.  The Minister might comment on that.  This is the type of thing it is important to anticipate and avoid if at all possible.  I noted an article in <i>Forbes<\/i>magazine which estimated that ISIS had an income in the region of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion.  That can only help it to export its terror across the globe.  In his consultations and dialogue with the US and UK authorities, has the Minister got a sense that they accept some responsibility for creating the climate in which this was allowed to happen in the Middle East because of the invasion of Iraq?  If there is such a recognition, what specifically do they see themselves doing to remedy what now looks like a disastrous consequence of an error of judgment?<\/p><p>While I am referring to the Middle East, I note the sense of abandonment Christians there in particular feel from the Western world.  There is a whole litany of things that have happened, including the recent discovery of mass graves of Yazidi people by Kurds and Iraqis, which demonstrates the inhumanity of ISIS terrorist groups and the number of people who have been killed.  We can only make conservative estimates as to how many at the moment.  Assyrian Christians have been taken hostage, with the consequent effects on them.  I understand from reports by Aid to the Church in Need a few weeks ago that up to 15 Assyrian Christians have been murdered.  There is the question of Coptic Christians being beheaded in Libya.  In the towns of Al-Shaddadeh and Al-Hasakah, 30 young Christian women were taken by ISIS with the intention of distributing them as concubines to serve the terrorists.  I note from <i>www.walkfree.org<\/i>, which campaigns on this issue, specific instances of families which have been affected by captivity and sexual slavery.  It is campaigning at UN Security Council level and targeting in particular Spain and New Zealand, which are new members.  What are we doing specifically at the UN to raise awareness and ensure the most effective action is taken to tackle, to coin a phrase of the Minister's predecessor but without making the superficial comparison he did, the human rights issue of our day - the persecution of Christians and others across that region?  It is absolutely appalling to any right-thinking person.<\/p><p>On 10 December 2014, the D&aacute;il passed a motion similar to the one passed by the Seanad on 26 October 2014 on the recognition of Palestine based on the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital.  Will the Government act on these motions, which were passed unanimously in both Houses, and will Ireland recognise the state of Palestine in the near future?  I join with my colleague Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe in his comments on imports from Israeli settlement areas.  The committee asked for those to be banned quite some time ago.  Many of us would welcome action on that.<\/p><p> Are efforts being made to persuade Egypt to reduce its restrictions on Gaza?  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, raised the issue of what was happening in Gaza.  These are fertile breeding grounds for the terrorists of the future, unless we address the issues arising.<\/p><p> It is sad that 17 years after the Good Friday Agreement was signed we are still seeing political manoeuvring and game playing in Northern Ireland.  The issue is too important for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#H00200","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>We are discussing the Foreign Affairs Council, not the situation in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#J00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I have spoken to the Minister about this subject.

It has been referred to as an historical starting point and I hope we will see significant movement towards a stabilisation and association agreement between Bosnia and the European Union.<\/p><p>The situation in Syria is an ongoing source of concern for the committee.  Prior to Christmas the Minister wrote an excellent piece for the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>on the terrorism and violence that threatened Syria and the Middle East, in which he called for an end to the Syrian conflict and a political transition to end President Assad's reign of terror.  Is there any indication that a political solution is likely to be found to end this reign of terror?  Hopes are being placed in a proposed peace plan, but any potential solution is jeopardised by the fact that the Assad regime continues to barrel bomb innocent people with impunity.  The conflict will hit its fourth anniversary on 15 March.  Given the number of people who have been displaced, I support Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's suggestions on Ireland taking in more refugees or doing more in this area.  Too many innocent children are being starved or bombed.  Are there discussions taking place at EU level on war crimes and the apparent immunity the Assad regime appears to enjoy?  What is the United Nations doing to charge some of the people involved with war crimes?  Ireland has been generous in the humanitarian aid we have contributed, but reports on the ground indicate that organisations which are trying to deliver aid to the worst affected areas are being prevented from doing so.  We need to highlight this problem at every opportunity.  Given the numbers displaced and the level of poverty evident on the ground, this must be the worst humanitarian crisis of our times.  Politicians need to redouble their efforts at national, European and international level to bring the Syrian conflict to an end at the earliest date.  I ask the Minister to comment on the issues of refugees and the delivery aid to the worst affected areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#J00500","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I will allow Senator Mark Daly to make a brief intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#J00600","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for updating us on the case of Ibrahim Halawa.

I hope the Minister will make a clear statement at the Council that the President's comment was disgraceful.  The suggestion was made by somebody from Luxembourg.  If there was an EU army, there would not be many people from that country in it.  For Germany to row in behind such a proposal is a step in the wrong direction.  I recently attended a foreign affairs meeting in Rome at which the Italians stated they wanted to see the European Union replace the Americans in spheres of influence on our borders.  Ireland and other neutral states need to be forceful on this issue.  When we see a slow but incremental drift towards an EU army by bigger states which want to save money by pooling resources and dragging the rest of us along, we should reiterate our opposition at every step.  If the President of the European Commission can suggest an EU army would be a solution to a problem, he obviously does not know what the problem is.

Senator Mark Daly should note that I have been in direct contact with EU colleagues.  I spoke to High Representative Catherine Ashton during the course of her tenure and renewed very strong representations to High Representative Mogherini during the course of the winter.  I also spoke to the chairman of the influential Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament.  I am familiar with the work of the Chairman of this committee.  We are all most concerned about the issue and anxious that there be a satisfactory resolution.  The only outcome that will be satisfactory will be the return home, at a very early date, of the teenager involved.  With my officials, both here and in Cairo, I will continue to prioritise the case and make representations at every level to achieve a successful outcome.  I will continue to keep the Chairman informed in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith referred to Ebola, as did others.  Ireland has delivered in full on its pledges, in addition on its pledges regarding the situation in Syria.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, is due to attend the next Syria pledging conference in Kuwait in March.  We have provided in excess of &euro;30 million since 2011.  The European Union is also continuing to deliver on its pledges to deal with the issue of Ebola.  The onus is on all donors to deliver because we still have a strong programme to complete.  Also to be considered are the delivery of humanitarian aid in the form of monetary donations and the purchase of humanitarian aid relief materials.  We have a very strong presence on the ground, not just in our full-time embassy in Freetown.  I am very pleased about the meeting held with the ambassador.  Members of the Defence Forces are assisting and will continue to assist.  That is acknowledged here in Ireland and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  I want to deal with the situation in the Middle East.  I thank Deputies Brendan Smith and Se&aacute;n Crowe, Senator Mark Daly and others for their ongoing interest in this issue.  I was very pleased to have an opportunity to visit the region some weeks ago.  My objective was not so much to engage in detailed political talks but to hear from all sides and see what was happening.  I did this and recounted some of my meetings in the D&aacute;il.  I met Foreign Minister Lieberman, President Abbas, Prime Minister Hamdallah and Labour Party leader Mr. Isaac Herzog.  I visited Gaza and the West Bank.  I share the concern of members about the circumstances in Gaza and the unacceptable humanitarian crisis that continues to obtain there.  There is a sense of hopelessness among the people.  I urged everybody involved in the region to help to relieve what was a most difficult crisis.<\/p> <p>  I also visited various villages in the neighbourhood of Gaza. I noted at first hand that the people faced daily the continuing Hamas threat from within.  In the circumstances, this is most unhelpful.  I agree with Senator Jim Walsh and Deputy Brendan Smith that the European Union should play a greater role in supporting the peace process.  That is a reason I visited.  The reason I did not make reference to this in my opening address was that it had not been discussed in any meaningful way at Foreign Affairs Council level in recent times.  I regret this.  I am satisfied, however, that High Representative Mogherini has prioritised the issue and I expect a comprehensive debate on it in the near future.  There is much more the European Union could do to influence and assist in what will have to be a negotiated settlement.  Obviously, there is an election campaign in the region and I do not expect dramatic initiatives of a political nature during the course of an election campaign.<\/p> <p>  I raised the issue of the blockade directly with Foreign Minister Lieberman.  I visited the settlements and expressed my dissatisfaction at them.  I believe I was representing the strong views of the Irish people in that regard.  The United Nations has advised that some reconstruction materials are getting through and that some work has been done.  There have been reports on materials, particularly construction materials such as concrete and cement, being diverted for tunnel activity.  I certainly understand the concerns of the Israelis in that regard, but I would like to see more progress being made on the ground.  People need houses and shelter.  I had the opportunity to say this directly to Foreign Minister Lieberman.  I hope circumstances can be improved in so far as the transmission of aid in the form of reconstruction materials can be facilitated by Israel, in particular.  I acknowledge the role played by the United Nations.<\/p> <p>  Let me respond to Deputy Brendan Smith.  In Cairo in October we pledged the sum of &euro;2.5 million in immediate aid.  It is disappointing that there has not been progress on reconstruction work.  I hope it will be prioritised, particularly after the Israeli elections.  There are elections also due to be held in the Palestinian territories.  I had an opportunity to discuss this issue directly with President Abbas and Prime Minister Hamdallah.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe referred to the settlements.  I saw at first hand the plans and the ground being prepared for construction following clearance.  The settlements continue to represent a major barrier to peace in the region.  Their ongoing expansion is incompatible with a genuine commitment towards a peaceful resolution and a viable two-state solution.  This continues to represent a main plank of Irish policy.  I take the points made by Senator Jim Walsh and Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe about settlement products.  The real problem, of course, is the settlements and their expansion and that will continue to be the major focus.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that in 2014 Ireland and other EU countries published advice warning citizens against investing in the settlements.  That advice continues to obtain.  I certainly foresee circumstances in which, in the context of further initiatives on the part of the European Union, both the settlements and our attitude to settlement products will be very much on the agenda.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the matter of recognition, raised by Senators Mark Daly and Jim Walsh and Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe and Brendan Smith, among others.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the vote of the Seanad and of the D&aacute;il in that regard and I wish to reiterate that for many years Ireland has supported the full achievement of the Palestinian state.  We said that we believed it should happen, but we want it to be achieved in reality, not just in theory and not just on paper.  I believe our view is that a formal recognition of a Palestinian state should come about as a comprehensive peace agreement.  This remains the position of the Government and it also remains the position of almost all our European Union partners.  Sweden is taking a different view and I have discussed the matter with my European colleagues and with the Swedish foreign minister.  EU foreign ministers will continue to exchange views on this issue, as we do on a very regular basis, so this matter will be advanced up the EU foreign affairs council agenda.  There is an election currently in Israel and it is generally held, and it is my view, that it would be impractical to pursue this matter further until after the forthcoming election and until there is an opportunity for the new government in Israel to bed down.<\/p><p>  I will turn to Ukraine and Russia.  Let me assure Deputy Durkan that Ireland fully supports the right of independent countries to decide freely on their policies and their external relationships.  This was something we discussed in the context of the association agreements and on the matter of Ukraine and its territory and its sovereignty.  I agree with Deputy Crowe and Senator Mullins when they speak about lethal weapons being provided to Ukraine.  Ireland seeks a non-military solution to this crisis and we are engaging at both political and diplomatic levels with our EU partners and beyond to ensure the crisis can be resolved without resorting to a military solution.  We do not believe that would be in the best interests of anybody in the region.  Providing lethal military equipment to Ukraine actually risks undermining the political and diplomatic efforts which are under way.  <\/p><p>  This brings me to Senator Walsh's, Senator Daly's and Deputy Crowe's points about the European army.  I read the views of President Juncker in his interview over the weekend.  There is no European army chair, as members well know, nor are there any plans for one.  We have only to look back to the Lisbon treaty and our protocol which clearly states that the Lisbon treaty does not provide for the creation of a European army.  There has been no discussion on this at foreign affairs level.  Ireland pursues a policy of military neutrality which I believe is quite clear.  It is in accordance with the wishes of the Parliament, the Government and the people.  It has most recently been highlighted in our foreign policy review update.  Ireland's participation in European common defence is prohibited by our Constitution, Articles 29 and 49 in particular, which position is reinforced by the Irish protocol to the Lisbon treaty.  Any change in that position can only take place with the approval of the people in a referendum.  While a number of referenda are planned during the tenure of this Government, let me assure the committee that this is most definitely not one of them.  Deputy Durkan made specific reference to the Russian overflight, but as he is not here I will communicate directly with him.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Mitchell, and others, raised the important issue of the EU migration policy, with particular reference to the very challenging situation in the Mediterranean.  The European Union is focused on the matter of the Mediterranean where there have been a number of tragic incidents.  Migrants seeking to enter Europe by sea have lost their lives and have been abandoned to their fates by unscrupulous dealers and human traffickers from the region and beyond.  We recognise however that the matter of illegal migration can only be tackled successfully by moving beyond border control issues and into partnerships for development to address the root causes of irregular and illegal migration.  I acknowledge the contribution of Deputy O'Sullivan on this issue, here at this committee and beyond.  I impress upon members the importance of the two EU-Africa initiatives which address a partnership approach to the main migration routes into Europe from Africa and the migration route from West Africa and the Horn of Africa.  The Rabat Process and the Khartoum Process bring together representatives of foreign affairs and interior Ministries from both sides of the Mediterranean Sea to focus primarily on tackling the smuggling of migrants and the unacceptable commercial activity of human trafficking.  It is an issue also for the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Ms Frederica Mogherini with her own experience as a Minister in the Italian government.  She, and other states in the region, are anxious that a positive set of policies are advanced, particularly in relation to the current unacceptable situation.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan I believe was the only one who mentioned Bosnia.  I will probably hold that reply until his return.  Senator Walsh, Deputy Smith and Deputy Durkan raised the issue of Christian communities in the Middle East.  Senator Mullins also continues to raise this issue and I acknowledge his interest in this.  Senator Walsh also has addressed this issue with me by private correspondence.  The spread of violence and extremism in Syria and Iraq is a most serious concern.  The attacks against civilians, especially religious minority communities, are utterly unacceptable.  I had the opportunity to include reference to this in my address to the United Nations in the autumn of 2014.  We are appalled by the atrocities committed by ISIS as it wages its campaign, not only across northern Iraq, but into Syria also.  There needs to be accountability for these atrocities, including referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, as mentioned by Senator Mullins.  I highlighted the issue again in Geneva last week when I addressed the UN Human Rights Council.  We will continue to raise the matter of protection of minority communities through our official bilateral contacts with many countries and stress the responsibility of governments to protect their citizens and minorities. <\/p><p>  We have raised the possibility, indeed the reality as it is now, of providing protection for a limited number of refugees from the region.  I am in close contact with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald.  This is being advanced between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Ireland is accepting 110 refugees in 2015 through the refugee resettlement programme with the UN High Commission for Refugees.  I discussed this last week in Geneva.  We accepted 90 from Syria in the 2014 programme.  Senator Walsh spoke about humanitarian aid in the form of money to Syria for the relief of the humanitarian crisis there.  Let me reiterate that more than &euro;30 million has been provided by Ireland since the onset of the crisis.  The EU has given &euro;3.2 billion.<\/p><p>I reiterate that more than &euro;30 million has been provided by Ireland since the onset of the crisis.  The EU has given a sum of &euro;3.2 billion.  However, the overall appeal by the United Nations continues.  The needs continue to be enormous.  I acknowledge that, in spite of a very challenging economic climate here, the Government has been in a position to ensure that Ireland is very much to the fore in terms of our monetary contributions.  That has been acknowledged at home and abroad.<\/p><p> I note that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has left.  If she returns I can address the issues she raised, with particular reference to the national plan for the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  We had a conference recently that covered this area; some of the members attended it, and the Chairman may also have attended.  It is an area on which our Department is actively engaged.<\/p><p> Senator Walsh and Deputy Smith mentioned the issue of ISIS and its funding.  I reiterate that the UK, Ireland, all other EU member states and the United States have signed up to UN Security Council Resolutions 2170 and 2178 setting out a comprehensive strategy which includes disrupting the flow of finances to ISIS and disrupting its fundraising.  We agreed to tackle the underlying factors as well as combating terrorism.  The EU strategy is in line with the UN resolutions condemning the appalling attacks.  <\/p><p> Deputies mentioned counter-terrorism and asked what has the EU has done since the Paris and Copenhagen attacks.  It is important that we continue to be focused on combating terrorism.  As well as the meetings upon which I have given a report, there have been an unprecedented number of emergency meetings during the past six months since I became Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We have had a number of meetings with very packed agendas, often with competing crises.  We endorsed the counter-terrorism strategy on foreign fighters in October and at a January meeting we agreed to make a summary copy of the strategy available to the public.<\/p><p> It is our belief that there must be a comprehensive human-rights-compliant approach to preventing counter-terrorism in accordance with international law.  I have discussed this issue with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has a role to play in ensuring that communities can be dissuaded from the type of radicalisation we have seen not so much in Ireland but in the UK and in other European countries, particularly France and Belgium.  We need to engage in communities with a focus on integration and communication.  We will continue to have that as a priority in strengthening partnerships with key countries in the region and assisting them in building their capacity to tackle aspects of terrorism in the region.  Justice Ministers have met separately and will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015031100002#K00300","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for comprehensively answering those questions.

I am Pat Davitt, the chief executive of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers &amp;amp; Valuers, IPAV, and I am here with our National President, Mr. Keith Anderson, who is also a practising auctioneer.<\/p> <p>   Our institute is the representative body for almost 1,000 auctioneers throughout the country.  It was set up in 1971 and it is the only institute catering solely for the professional and educational requirements of auctioneers and valuers throughout Ireland.  IPAV places a strong focus on professional education and runs a series of higher level courses in collaboration with the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, which is approved by the National Property Services Regulatory Authority for auctioneering licence purposes.  We also provide opportunities for auctioneers to develop their studies to degree level 7 and 8 in the College of Estate Management, Reading, in the United Kingdom. <\/p> <p>   The institute works with Government Departments and other arms of the State in advancing issues of policy relevant to the auctioneering profession.  We have actively promoted throughout the years the European Valuation Standards, blue book, believing them to be the highest quality standards.  They have now been accepted by the European Central Bank as its favoured valuation standards throughout Europe. <\/p> <p>   Given our reach into every town in Ireland our members form a central part of the local business community serving those buying and selling properties locally and also further afield. <\/p> <p>   The background to the research which the committee has kindly invited us to share with it today came about as a result of concerns expressed by our members about the growing length of time the conveyancing process was taking in Ireland.  We surveyed members in January 2015 and more than 200 members responded to a series of ten questions.  I believe all members of the committee have a copy of the study and no doubt they will have of questions for us.  Therefore at this juncture I will not go through it line by line.  Rather, IPAV President, Mr. Keith Anderson, who has played a lead role in the research, will take members through some of the highlights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I would like to say at the outset that solicitors, whom we work with on an ongoing basis, for the most part do a fine job for purchasers and sellers alike.  However, there are severe inefficiencies within the system as currently operated.  Our study was aimed at getting some measure of what is happening and from there to work with all interests to try to address deficiencies in the systems.  <\/p> <p>   Our research found that over 60% of auctioneers said they were experiencing unwarranted delays from the time a sale is agreed to close of sale.  Almost 37% said they had experienced such delays sometimes and a mere 3.7% said they were not experiencing unwarranted delays.  Members were then asked the most common reasons for such delays.  There are two main reasons.  The major reason for such delays was solicitors' conveyancing procedures, and these were identified as a reason by an overwhelming 79% of respondents.  Coming in second place was policy procedures at lending institutions, and these were identified as a reason by over 45% of respondents.  When it came to the length of time from sale agreed to a close of sale it was on average almost four months in 2013, and that extended to four and a half months in 2014.  Members were asked to give a view on whether delays were attributable to a reluctance on the part of solicitors to do business by e-mail or telephone, instead favouring the traditional method of letter writing.  Over seven in every ten agreed that this was the case.  The remaining 30% were asked for their views and the reasons they gave were greater caution in signing off documents in recent times, high levels of due diligence required, and inefficiencies.  <\/p> <p>   There is no getting away from the fact that very serious consequences arise from delays in conveyancing.  In our study, 68%, or seven in ten auctioneers, have lost sales, and over 27% have experienced banks withdrawing finance.  What is happening here is that against a backdrop of financial pressure consumers are trying to make plans for the future.  They research the market for a suitable property, and in many urban areas that is not easy to find at the moment.  When they eventually find a property within their budget they make an offer.  In many cases they wait in trepidation to see if they will be outbid.  It is a moment of joy when they are told that their offer has been accepted and the property goes sale agreed.  At this point it should be only a matter of a short few weeks before they take full possession and start a new phase in their lives but that is not how it happens for many.  Purchasers and sellers are coming back to us week after week frustrated with a lack of progress after the sale is agreed.  Many move on and try to buy another property, with the added time and expense involved.  In a recovering property market some are worried that if they do not succeed in buying the home they want prices may rise beyond what they can afford.  It is a very unsatisfactory situation for both buyers and sellers.  Delays in conveyancing are not within the control of the auctioneering profession yet our members' reputations are being tarnished in their own communities as a result of delays in conveyancing which lead directly to gazumping.<\/p> <p>  In conjunction with our study we asked our colleagues in the European Real Estate Confederation, CEI, and the European Council of Real Estate Professions, CEPI, about their experiences.  The results which are set out at the back of the document that the committee has contrast sharply with the Irish experience.  Across Europe lawyers conduct a great deal of real estate business via e-mail and telephone and the majority of sales are closed within 30 to 60 days.  As our CEO, Mr. Pat Davitt, said, I am a practising auctioneer and I see these problems first-hand every week.  I have to deal with frustrated consumers who are trying to do nothing more than secure a home for themselves and their families. <\/p> <p>   At this point I will hand back briefly to our chief executive, Mr. Pat Davitt, who will outline our proposals to the committee for addressing the issues identified in our research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#B00250","nonspeaker":"Mr. Keith Anderson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>Auctioneers, like solicitors, are represented in every town in Ireland and they, like us, are an important part of that community.  These serious delays in conveyancing are not good for property buyers and sellers, and commonly lead to gazumping.  They are not good for auctioneers and ultimately they are not good for solicitors either.  Our President, Mr. Anderson, has outlined some of the impediments for solicitors.  We also appreciate that many solicitors' offices are under pressure arising from the fallout of the financial crisis.  Some will have been forced to let staff go and some are not in a position yet to ramp up again.<\/p> <p>   In residential investment property sales there is now an added layer of legal involved.  The buyer, if purchasing with a mortgage, now has to pay for the bank's solicitor as well as their own.  The seller pays their own solicitor.  So there are now three different solicitors involved in this transaction.  This is a far cry from the practices operated and enjoyed by our European neighbours, as our survey points out.  We ask this committee to look into this with a view to changing this practice.  If banks are not happy with using the purchaser's solicitor to certify title we propose that they set up a panel of solicitors from which purchasers could choose one.  This would dispense with the need for an additional solicitor and would cut weeks off the timeframe from sale agreed to close of sale.  This is done very successfully with valuation panels; the valuation on the property is a very important part of the transaction.  We fail to see why this would not work.  After all, while consumers pay the bills and the mortgage, the bank holds the deeds and it is in their interest to make sure that the job is done correctly. <\/p> <p>   Interestingly, section 7(3) of the new SI 47 of 2015 from the Central Bank, Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Housing Loan Requirements) Regulations 2015, which deals with the new loan-to-value, LTV, and loan-to-income ratios, LTI, states: \"A lender shall ensure that the appraiser appointed by that lender shall undertake a market valuation of a residential property which is required under these Regulations not earlier than a period of two months before the date on which the advance under the housing loan is made by the lender.\"  Therefore, if conveyancing goes beyond that two-month deadline a new valuation will have to be sought by the financial institution.  If the new valuation comes in lower than the original one, and the loan is for the maximum of 80% LTV allowed under the Central Bank new rules this will throw all the bank loan documents out of sync.  New loan documents will have to be drafted, further delaying the process. <\/p> <p>   In Construction 2020, recommendation 73 states: \"In collaboration with key stakeholders (the legal profession and the banking sector) we will review and report on the steps required to deliver a system of e-conveyancing in Ireland, including the resource implications and timeframes for delivery.\"  At a recent meeting with the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland it confirmed that it is very supportive of an e-conveyancing system.  We have sought a meeting with the Law Society with a view to attaining its assistance in addressing the situation. <\/p> <p>   As public representatives we ask the members of the committee to support a fast-tracking of State plans for the e-conveyancing system.  The Property Registration Authority has been set up and it has recently indicated that e-conveyancing could be up and running in two and a half years.  This, in our view, is far too long and far too far away.  With banks increasingly offloading more properties the current situation is likely to be exacerbated.<\/p><p>The property price register sales figures for 2014 show that 40,000 properties changed hands.  This is a turnover of between 2% and 2.5%.  However, a normal functioning property market would be expected to turn over 4% of all possible stock.  If this number of properties had to be conveyed it would most likely exacerbate the current problems.  The electronic stamping system was set up in 2009 by the Revenue Commissioners with great success.  Its success could be replicated with e-conveyancing.  We would ask that the committee would do everything within its powers to speed it up.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman.  We would be happy to take any questions you may wish to put to us. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for his presentation.

From my limited experience, and the Chairman is around a lot longer than I am, I suggest that the witness set up a formalised working group and put together various sectoral interests campaigning for e-conveyancing.  It has a far better chance of progressing with the auctioneers and the Law Society and others involved.  I believe it requires this because while the Government would agree with the principle, it has a lot of other more pressing priorities.  If the Government was dealing with an umbrella group of sectoral interests the campaign would have a better chance of progressing quicker.<\/p> <p>   My other point concerns the area of gazumping.  No disrespect to the two witnesses, but auctioneers have been as responsible as anybody else for gazumping and for some of the behaviour which ended up creating and causing gazumping, particularly during the Celtic tiger period.  Would it be the view of witnesses that gazumping should be illegal and that legislation should be introduced to prevent it, as exists in other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#C00800","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>Of course as an auctioneers' representative I am going to tell you that auctioneers never take part in gazumping.  It is quite easy to see why we do not take part.  Gazumping happens when a purchaser who did not get to buy a property, makes a further higher offer on the property.  Since 2012 it is against the law to not pass a bid on to a vendor if it is made after the property goes sale agreed and before the actual contracts are signed.  If I sell a property today, it goes sale agreed.  If someone else then makes a higher offer the next day or a week later, I have to go back to the vendor.  If I do not go back to the vendor, that vendor can complain to the regulatory authority and I could lose my licence.  The moral of the story is that auctioneers do not like gazumping, it is not good for us and we do not want it to be practised.<\/p> <p>   I was on the 2004 committee when the Property Services Regulatory Authority started.  I proposed there should be a sales contract for auctioneers so when we do a sale we should be able to take out a sales contract, complete it with the vendor and the purchaser and then sign it with both parties so there could be no gazumping after that.  That sales contract would put a stop to it but it would be subject to a contract completed by the Law Society or by a solicitor, a formal contract completed after that sales contract was done.  We do not like the practice, but we have to take part in it because it is the law.  We cannot do anything else only take part in it if someone makes us an offer.  Everyone is entitled to buy a property until such time as the contracts are signed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015031100002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Davitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1113,"content":"<p>There are rogue auctioneers the same as there are rogue solicitors and everything else, but I do admire the tenacity of the witnesses' defence of his profession.

The juniors had looked after conveyancing and the senior partner looked after litigation and different aspects.  They have less staff now so they are trying to do the conveyancing themselves.  Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone in 1876 and to this day solicitors will not use the telephone, nor will they use e-mail.  They will write to clients.  It takes a week to write a letter and week to come back.  That is the most frustrating aspect.  There is a need to get around the table and sort things out in plain language.  E-mail is as good as letters nowadays.  It is frustrating that time goes on, which opens up more problems.

We are looking for people buying a house for the first time because those are the people we are dealing with.  In the last six years when things were quiet, I was out showing houses to first-time buyers every day from 2007 straight through to 2014 - and people thought I was a busy fool.  Although I kept showing properties to people, young couples were cautious because they were afraid of what was happening and who would blame them?  Everybody just sat back and watched.  This year those same young people are back trying to buy houses.  They are trying to get on the ladder but it is taking months and months and they get frustrated and so do we.

We have asked that there be a complete timeframe on contracts so that a contract would have to be issued and the sale would have to close within a certain amount of time.

Having received my warrant of appointment from the President last month, I welcome the fact that my first appearance before the Oireachtas in my capacity as Ombudsman for Children is to discuss the role and functions of the office.<\/p>  <p>  The Ombudsman for Children's office is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.  The office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  The one that is perhaps most familiar to the committee is the function to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children.  In carrying out this function, the office observes the fundamental principles of an ombudsman, namely, it is independent and impartial, it is neither an advocate for the complainant nor an adversary to the public body, it seeks at all times to promote the swift resolution of complaints at a local level, where possible, and it aims to achieve systemic change through its investigatory work by tackling the root causes of the complaints we receive.<\/p>  <p>  However, the investigatory mandate set out in the Ombudsman for Children Act also contains a number of distinct elements derived from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, namely, the obligation to have regard to the best interests of the child and give due consideration to the wishes of the child when investigating a complaint.  My office has developed considerable expertise with respect to engaging directly with children, some of whom are very young, when examining the cases that come to us.  This aspect of accessibility has been identified by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as an essential component of the work of an ombudsman for children.  <\/p>  <p>         My office saw a significant rise in the number of complaints received in 2013 with 16% more complaints received than in 2012 and a 28% increase from 2010.  The majority of complaints are in relation to education, 43% in 2013, and a significant proportion of complaints received also relate to family support, care and protection issues, 26% in 2013.  The vast majority of complaints, 75% in 2013, are brought by parents on behalf of their children.<\/p> <p>  While we work continuously to provide a high standard of service, the increasing volume and complexity of complaints is placing significant demands on our capacity to respond and I have submitted a business case to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs regarding additional resources to carry out our tasks.  I take this opportunity to commend all my staff for their efforts in this regard and must acknowledge that it has put immense pressure on the whole office.  <\/p> <p>The complaints received range in levels of complexity and the issues raised are often of the most serious nature including complaints about the handling of child protection concerns, services and supports for children in care, access to education, resource allocation for children with special needs, and access to suitable housing.  The information gained through examination and investigation of complaints allows my office the opportunity to address the situation for individual children and also to look at systemic change that will improve how the public body interacts with all children and families. <\/p> <p>  A dominant feature of investigations, with few exceptions, is that they highlight a lack of awareness about the impact of public administrative decision making on the lives and rights of children and their families.  Decision making that affects children directly and sometimes indirectly is often not informed by its impact on the children concerned, nor is it informed by children's rights principles.  The procedures, and in some cases those applying them, are not aware of or sensitive to the needs or rights of children or their families or the relationship between timely decision making and good administration.  At times, individual children can be largely invisible and decision making can be excessively bureaucratic and lacking in flexibility to meet the individual needs of children.  There appears to be few checks and balances in administrative decision-making processes and few mechanisms for challenging the decision or the position adopted. <\/p> <p>  In addition to examining and investigating complaints, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is mandated to promote and monitor the rights of all children in Ireland.  The Oireachtas conferred a range of functions on the Ombudsman for Children under section 7 of the Act to carry out this complementary role.  These functions include advising the Government and the Oireachtas on law and policy affecting children; advising Ministers of the Government on the development and coordination of policy affecting children; promoting awareness of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including among young people; and engaging directly with children and young people to highlight issues relating to their rights that are of concern to children themselves.<\/p> <p>  The different functions of the office inform and support each other.  Work undertaken in accordance with one particular statutory function may trigger complementary work under a different function.  Similarly, where there is an obstacle to tackling children's rights issues due to an exclusion to the OCO's investigatory remit, for example, we can use another function to address the problem.  An example of this concerns young people in detention.  Members of the committee may recall that prior to 2012, the Ombudsman for Children was excluded from investigating complaints from young people in prison.  In the absence of being able to receive complaints, the OCO used its statutory function to engage directly with children and young people in order to undertake a consultation with the young people detained in St. Patrick's Institution.  The purpose of this work was to give the young people in question the opportunity to highlight concerns they had regarding the institution and put forward concrete suggestions on how their situation might be improved.  My intention in setting out this example is to demonstrate that a broad mandate that blends different functions can offer a range of options to address children's rights issues.  This is a very important aspect of the strong and robust mandate that the Oireachtas has given my office.<\/p> <p>  Although that mandate is strong and robust, every year since its establishment in 2004, the Ombudsman for Children's Office has identified areas in which the Ombudsman for Children Act can be further strengthened.  Of particular note in connection to this is that the Ombudsman for Children Act obliges me to monitor and review generally the operation of the Act itself and to make recommendations to the Government and to the Oireachtas for amending that legislation.  In March 2012, the OCO submitted its first review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act to the Oireachtas, in accordance with that statutory function.  The review was informed by the OCO's own experience, international best practice, and the recommendations made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to the State when it last examined Ireland in 2006.  The report prepared by the office was supplemented by concrete suggestions for amending the Act in the form of a draft Ombudsman for Children (Amendment) Bill.  I am glad to report that many of the changes sought by the OCO in its review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act were achieved through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  In particular, a number of public bodies previously excluded from the investigatory remit of the office, such as the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, became reviewable agencies.  <\/p> <p>  I take this opportunity to record my office's appreciation for the efforts of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in facilitating and supporting these amendments to the Ombudsman for Children Act.  Nonetheless, a number of issues remain outstanding.  I will now set out the principal matters that are in need of further attention.<\/p> <p>  The independence of my office should be enhanced.  Independence has a number of dimensions but one of the most important is having adequate resources to discharge the functions given to the office by the Oireachtas and being free from any potential political pressure that could be applied through changes to the office's financial resources.  At present, the OCO receives its funding through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In practical terms, the control of the OCO's budget by the Department has not proven to be problematic.  However, it is inappropriate for an independent human rights institution to receive its funding through a public body that it can investigate.  I believe that the situation should be remedied by providing for the OCO's funding to come directly from the Oireachtas.  This was also a recommendation made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  That UN committee will certainly raise the question once again when it examines Ireland in January 2016 regarding its compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p> <p>  My office&rsquo;s investigatory remit is not as extensive as it should be.  The committee is well acquainted with the need for appropriate, independent complaint handling for protection applicants, including those currently residing in the direct provision centres.  The long-standing position of my office is that the current exclusion to the investigatory remit of the office in relation to the administration of the law regarding asylum and immigration relates only to decisions on status.  My office believes everything else, including issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaint handling, are in remit.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality does not share this understanding.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has recommended that the Oireachtas put the matter beyond doubt and provide clear, unambiguous access for protection applicants to my office.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention this afternoon.  I have only had the opportunity to sketch out a number of issues in general terms.  I am happy to address any queries the committee may have in regard to them or to other aspects of my role and functions as Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426089600,"counter":1181,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his presentation.  In relation to the issue of legal professional privilege it is most helpful that Dr. Muldoon is before us here today.  I am particularly mindful of the March 2012 report by the then ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, and it was on the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  Section 4 of that report deals with investigation of complaints procedure and access to information.  I know Dr. Muldoon does not have the report before him but I draw his attention to points 4.2 and 4.3, which state:<\/p><blockquote>An issue that has arisen in this context is access to documents in respect of which public bodies claim legal professional privilege.  It is not uncommon for this office to have difficulty obtaining documents germane to an investigation due to a claim of such privilege.  This can give rise to serious concerns if, as has been the experience of ombudsmen in other jurisdictions, such an approach is adopted primarily to frustrate an investigation.<\/blockquote>  <p>It then goes on to say:<\/p><blockquote>This is not to call into question the importance of legal professional privilege as such.  It is to advocate for its proper use.  Understanding decision-making by public bodies is the core of the Ombudsman for Children's investigation and there are instances in which much may turn on the legal advice received by a public body.  The purpose of obtaining and considering such documentation is to see what light it can cast on the administrative actions of the public body.  It should be emphasised that this relates to legal advice received by an organisation under investigation and not any given individual.<\/blockquote>  <p>I note from that report how the Australian federal ombudsman is empowered by section 9 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 to obtain such information.  How much of an issue is this for Dr. Muldoon as a new ombudsman coming in?  How does his office find or suspect that the claiming of legal professional privilege is adopted primarily to frustrate an investigation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#C00150","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426089600,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>As can be seen from the 2012 report it has been an issue across the office.  It is not widespread but certainly it has happened on occasion and we have been able to negotiate our way around it up to now but we would like to put it beyond doubt.  The key role of any ombudsman is to find out how a decision was made and why people came to that decision to generate a certain action within a public body.  If legal advice guides them in a certain direction it is important that we have that access to that legal advice.  We also point out that anything that comes to our attention through an investigatory remit is confidential and so there is no issue in that regard.  <\/p>  <p>         There are no issues in this regard.  It is about putting beyond doubt our ability to access.

Is this a significant feature of the complaints the Ombudsman for Children receives or a general concern of his?  If it is not I strongly urge him to look at it because the situation is dire.<\/p>  <p>  Many families with children, often with disabilities and special needs, arrive to local authority offices facing homelessness and are told there is nothing for them and to sleep in the car for the weekend, or they are placed in completely unsuitable environments such as hotels or emergency hostel accommodation with people with drug problems.  This week I spoke to a young woman with two young special needs children who was placed in a hotel.  After she walked through the door, she was offered heroin by the first person she met, in front of her children.  This is where the local authority put her.  It is absolutely unacceptable for children to be in this environment.  Does the Ombudsman for Children receive many complaints in this area?  Does he have concerns about it?  If so, is he making his views known?  Should I encourage people to make complaints to the Ombudsman for Children about the situation, because it needs to be dealt with urgently?<\/p>  <p>  I am also greatly concerned about youth mental health services.  Does the Ombudsman for Children receive many complaints in this area and is he concerned?  The situation in this regard is also dire.  There is a lack of beds for young people with mental health problems, often who are self-harming and possibly suicidal.  They are either put in adult hospitals which are totally inappropriate, or told there is nothing for them and are given no supports or resources.  I have a very worrying case of a mother who believes her son may commit suicide.  He has been self-harming.  She has gone to the HSE, and to everybody, but has been told there is nothing for her.  I would like the Ombudsman for Children to respond on these two areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#D01800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1426089600,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>Before Dr. Muldoon responds, I should have asked him whether he is happy for his presentation to be published on the Oireachtas website and to be circulated to the media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#D01900","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426089600,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#D02000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1426089600,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#D02100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426089600,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>With regard to children and families being forced into homeless services, in 2011 the Office of the Ombudsman for Children created a report on concerns about homeless issues for young people.

Over the past year or two we have found this has completely changed and the type of people becoming homeless are a different entity.  <\/p>  <p>         As the Deputy pointed out, it now affects young families who previously would have survived within the rental accommodation scheme.

I am interested in learning more about how Dr. Muldoon views his role in advising Government on policy.  We often discuss the issue of child poverty and the immediate reaction is that it is not something we want to happening.  However, we know the reality for some families.  Based on Dr. Muldoon's advisory role, is there anything in particular about Government policy that should be altered, whether in a minor or a major way, to eradicate child poverty?  I accept that is a somewhat general question.<\/p>  <p>  All of us would agree that it is dreadful to have child poverty in our midst.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about the issue of homelessness and how that might enter into the equation but in certain parts of the country homelessness is not happening.  <\/p>  <p>               I am not saying that there are no difficulties with housing, but they are not to such extremes.  Anecdotally and from my dealings with families, I have often been struck by how families get the same resources from the State, such as welfare and so on, even when there is child poverty, for example, children are not brought to school on time or to medical appointments.  This would add to poverty and to poor outcomes for children, be they education, health or other outcomes.<\/p> <p> This relates to another matter.  Resources and money are given.  I will call the former \"money\" as well.  We often refer to money, but it is needed to address child poverty.  I am asking the witnesses and saying something at the same time; these are just thoughts.  Is it not correct that child poverty is a complex issue?  The family's ability to support a child goes beyond the financial.  Beyond what  may term the \"political speak\" of \"child poverty\" and \"we must\", how does Government policy measure up against the policies of countries that we consider progressive?  Would the witnesses suggest any action as a particularly good one for the Government to take?  How complex is this issue and how is it measured?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#E01200","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426089600,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>This is a light subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015031100002#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426089600,"counter":1219,"content":"<p>I hope that I can address it.  I am new to this role and have not examined the legislation in that way yet, but my initial thoughts would be that there is already an understanding of child poverty.  We have many top class agencies and individuals, including in Departments, who understand how child poverty is happening.  It is still increasing.  As far as I can tell, what is on the ground and the ability to resource are at issue.  There are many programmes, for example, the breakfast clubs run by Barnardos.  As Deputy Mulherin mentioned, funding is going to certain areas but is not necessarily being used in the best way.  No more than in the case of mental health, support needs to be given to each of these areas.  The supports and legislation have been designed, but there is not enough follow-through to prevent child poverty.  One needs to start at the earliest possible point to help a family back onto its feet and learn how to assist its children in attending school and how to provide the best possible opportunities.  We have those systems in place, but it may be a lack of resources that is the difficulty.  It is not my place to comment on where those resources should come from or go and I do not know whether legislation would help the child poverty scenario, but there are opportunities to use what is already in place, make it better and allow those families to gather the supports we have designed and access them properly and in a coherent way, which has not been the case heretofore.<\/p>  <p>  The eradication of child poverty is, as the Deputy mentioned, a large task.

I am accompanied by Mr. Hugh Creegan, director of transport investment and taxi regulation at the National Transport Authority, NTA.<br\/><br\/>One the primary functions of the authority is to secure the provision of public bus passenger transport services across the State.  Public bus passenger services are provided in three forms.  The first relates to commercial public bus passenger services which are licensed by the authority under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  These services are not in receipt of a State subsidy but are available to the public.  Examples include Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services, Aircoach, Citilink, etc.  It is important to note that commercial bus service variations are entirely at the discretion of the service provider.  There is no legislative provision to enable the authority to refuse an amendment to services unless we consider the change will impact on other services locally.  Second, public bus passenger services which have a public service obligation, PSO, are provided throughout Ireland under contract to the authority, primarily by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  These services are in receipt of a State subsidy.  Third, public bus passenger services in rural areas are provided under the rural transport programme.  Many of these services are demand-responsive services, that is, the route can be varied to pick up customers.  These services are in receipt of a State subsidy.<br\/><br\/>In 2009, the authority entered into public service contracts which incorporate public service obligations with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A further direct award contract was granted to Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2014 for five years.  The new contracts contain higher performance standards for the services supplied by each operator with regard to the reliability, punctuality and quality of services provided.  The Act and the contracts allow for changes to be made to the contracts - unilaterally by the authority if necessary - to amend the specifics of the public service obligation network of services provided, the performance obligations specified and the reporting and monitoring arrangements.  Any proposed changes by the operators to the services are subject to approval by the authority before they can be implemented.<br\/><br\/>The authority is now managing the rural transport programme on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and is in contract with a large number of operators across the State providing transport services in remote rural areas.  These services are managed by the transport co-ordination units across the country as the authority's agents.  This allows the authority to examine all public bus passenger services together to ensure that the greatest coverage and efficiency is achieved across the country for the subsidies that are being paid for those services.<br\/><br\/>The authority has undertaken service reviews in a number of regions throughout the country and has implemented many changes in partnership with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In the regional cities, these changes have resulted in growth in passenger numbers and revenue in Cork and Galway in particular.  Further amendments have been made in Sligo and in the Dublin commuter belt with changes to PSO services in Kerry and Mayo being planned for implementation shortly<br\/><br\/>The licensing of commercial public bus passenger services is controlled by the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 Act.  These bus services are those that are available to members of the public on a commercial basis, that is, they do not receive any compensation from the State.  The statutory guidelines for the licensing of public bus passenger services explain how bus licence applications and amendments will be handled and the criteria under which they will be assessed in order to serve the transport customer and enable competition within a structured framework.  The guidelines are available on the authority&rsquo;s website at <i>www.nationaltransport.ie<\/i>.  Examples of commercially licensed bus services include those provided by Aircoach, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway services, Citilink, Matthews and Swords Express among others.<br\/><br\/>The economic climate over the past number of years has been challenging for passenger transport companies generally as they have been experiencing falling passenger demand resulting in reduced revenues while simultaneously experiencing increases in costs.  These conditions have begun to change with a better economic outlook, improved passenger journeys and a significant reduction in the price of oil now on the horizon.  The improvement in road infrastructure between major towns and cities has had a variety of impacts.  Car journey times between town and cities have fallen substantially and this has posed a challenge for the public transport alternatives.  A number of operators have reacted by taking greater advantage of the improved road infrastructure to reduce their journey times and offer more direct services.  This has resulted in a more attractive offer for end-to-end travellers.  However, it has also meant that some operators have sought to withdraw from locations along the route so as to keep journey times short or because the level of demand at these locations is low.<br\/><br\/>The licensing system manages the commercial responses of operators to ensure that a more comprehensive and better public transport service is created for citizens through the issuing of licences alongside the contracted and subsidised services.  This is achieved by examining services in an integrated timetable to maximise service coverage.  There is nothing to prevent any licensed operator from applying to the authority to amend the times and-or routings of commercial services.  Such amendments are considered in accordance with essentially the same criteria used for issuing licences.  Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s branded Expressway services fall into this category.  There is also nothing to prevent an operator from terminating a licensed service at any time for their own business reasons.  However, where an amendment proposal relating to a commercial service would have no impact on any other commercial or subsidised service, the current legislative provisions require the authority to grant that service amendment even if it considers that it would adversely impact the area served.  This reflects the fact that these licences are for commercial services where the operator is taking all the financial risk.  <br\/><br\/>We are acutely aware of significant concerns at the loss of certain commercial services in rural towns and villages.  In particular, the largest commercial operator, Bus &Eacute;ireann, has sought and been granted amendments to its Expressway licences throughout the country and in particular on the route 5, Wexford-Dublin, and route 7, Cork-Clonmel-Dublin services.  JJ Kavanagh through its Avalen and Kenneally companies has also sought and been granted amendments to its licences on the Waterford to Dublin corridor, which has resulted in a significant reduction in services in some towns along that route and some towns with no services.<br\/><br\/>The authority is now faced with finding some way to fill gaps in public transport at a time when the available subsidies may not be sufficient to meet the public need despite having stabilised this year after many years of reduction.  We are actively examining the re-configuration of nearby PSO services and also the services provided under the rural transport programme as an in-fill option but these possibilities all have to be within the budgets that are available.<\/p><p>We will procure services if the gaps cannot be filled by reconfiguring existing subsidised services, subject to the funding being made available.  Tender documents are being prepared in parallel to reduce the delivery time for any new services.  A working group of representatives of all the communities affected along route 7 has been set up.  The authority will actively engage with that group on any proposed replacement services.  The replacement services for route 5 have been finalised and the local representatives will be briefed in the next week on those proposals.<\/p><p> The authority is obliged to complete a review of Part 2 of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 on the licensing of public bus passenger services and related guidelines this year.  We will be seeking both the public and key stakeholders&rsquo; views prior to reporting to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p> The provision of public bus passenger services in a dynamic environment is challenging.  The authority is best placed to review all existing services and to provide an integrated bus and rail services more effectively throughout the State.  We remain committed to ensuring that State subsidies are deployed to optimal effect across the country to maintain as many services as possible and to plan for growth in those services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>Before inviting Mr. Martin Nolan from Bus &Eacute;ireann to make his opening presentation, I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Michael Warnock-Smith from the National Transport Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1239,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to discuss the company&rsquo;s recent changes to certain interregional Expressway routes.  I am accompanied by the chairman of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Mr. Aidan Murphy, and one of our regional managers, Mr. David Lane.<br\/><br\/>As the company&rsquo;s business structure may appear complex due to the integrated network it provides, I would like to clarify the position of Expressway <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the other services we provide.  While our integrated network provides great benefit to rural communities, the company must account financially for each product on an individual basis.  Funds generated by the PSO remain within the PSO network.  Any surplus arising on school transport is ring-fenced for reinvestment in the school transport scheme and Expressway can only access funds it has generated itself.  While the company will report a surplus for 2014, Expressway itself earned less than &euro;500,000 for the year.  While this result represents a significant improvement on previous years, it still leaves much work to be done to make the product financially viable.<br\/><br\/>Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s overall strategy is focused on providing safe, value-for-money and customer centred transport services to urban and rural communities in an effective and efficient manner across three main product areas.  First, we continue to work in partnership with the National Transport Authority to negotiate and deliver the best possible public transport offering for PSO services provided under direct award contract outside the Dublin metropolitan area.  Work programmes are focused on passenger and capacity growth on the core network as the economy recovers, supported by fleet replacement, facilities and infrastructure investment.  Second, we are delivering further cost savings and efficiencies in the provision of school transport services on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Third, we continue to develop the commercial interregional Expressway brand along with network improvements for faster journey times and more competitive fares.  Despite the recent changes, Expressway continues to play a vital role in connecting local transport networks to urban centres across the country without receipt of PSO subvention. <br\/><br\/>In his presentation to this committee last July, our chairman, Mr. Aidan Murphy, pointed out that Bus &Eacute;ireann has been in survival mode in recent years.  The company worked its way out of the recession but we are conscious that there will be a restricted Exchequer purse for the foreseeable future.  Bus &Eacute;ireann remains committed to working with its stakeholders to deliver the best transport system possible in an efficient and effective manner given the funds available.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has unfortunately been required to make hard decisions to ensure financial sustainability.  We have delivered on all of our commitments to the NTA, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Education and Skills.  The ingredients for a sustainable public transport system are being delivered. <br\/><br\/>In respect of PSO services provided under contract to the NTA, we are focused on identifying the range and level of public transport services required outside the Dublin metropolitan area over the period of the five year contract to 2019.  It should be noted that as the PSO subvention has been significantly cut in recent years, the scope for maintaining local public transport services out of the existing PSO payment has been eliminated.  For the avoidance of doubt, members will appreciate that the contract with the NTA does not in any way include Expressway services.  We do not receive any PSO payment from the NTA for the delivery of our Expressway services.  These services comprise 23 interregional routes that operate across the country, linking cities and population hubs and now served by our distinctive large red and silver coaches.  Expressway must generate its own funds for investment in new coaches to survive in the long term.<br\/><br\/>I will now outline the changes that we have implemented on our commercial Expressway services over the last few years, the latest of which relate to routes 5 and  7.  The changes that we have made on Expressway services in recent years are due to competitive pressures brought about by the increased availability of commercial licences, locations being bypassed by motorways and the changing needs of our customers.  The vast majority of our Expressway customers want faster interregional journeys between the main population concentrations, where possible using the motorway.  I previously shared our concerns about the impact of the motorways on smaller towns and villages with Oireachtas committees in 2008, 2009 and 2012.  I also advised that changes to a number of our commercial Expressway intercity routes were required to ensure their survival and to protect local jobs given the increasing liberalisation of the market and what I would call cherry-picking of routes by private operators.  Nothing has changed in this regard.  Competition on Expressway routes has increased since 2012 and, unfortunately, most of what we predicted has come to pass.  As a company, if we do not make changes required by customers, Expressway will go out of business and jobs will be lost both within Bus &Eacute;ireann and among the wide range of suppliers that depend on Bus &Eacute;ireann across the country.  We cannot trade recklessly.  Expressway has to make a commercial return on its routes to enable fleet replacement because it does not receive any funding for buses or coaches on these routes.<br\/><br\/>In the past, and as part of the social dividend we returned to the State, we provided Expressway connections to many of the secondary locations that have now been bypassed as a result of the expanding motorway network.  With the increased level of licensing for direct services to and from the main population concentrations, our ability to service many of these secondary locations in a sustainable manner has been eliminated.  Since the legal changes to our roles introduced in 2009, the NTA is ultimately responsible for the transport solution for the towns affected by our recent decisions on routes 7 and 5.  The NTA's role is to determine the most efficient public transport alternative.  Funding is obviously integral to any decision it makes.  We will continue to work with the NTA to inform its decisions and we will bring our own proposals to the table.<br\/><br\/>As part of the Expressway turnaround programme in recent years, our Expressway services have had to come out of about 17% of secondary locations.  However, in most cases an alternative public transport connection exists or was made available.  Overall, there has been no widespread loss of services to rural locations as a result of the decisions we have to make, despite what some commentators have tried to suggest.  In this regard, I underline our steadfast commitment to serving rural Ireland.  As the biggest provider of rural transport in the country, almost 10,000 people help to deliver our services every day.  These people work and live throughout the towns and villages of Ireland, with their wage packets contributing to the sustenance of local economies.  We are proud and dedicated in our commitment to rural Ireland and to the provision of jobs and services in these communities.  I would like to emphasise this point given our heritage of transport service which dates back now to the 1930s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for presenting a clear picture of the role of the NTA and Expressway as a commercial service.

They are real communities and not that far from Castlecomer, County Kilkenny.  Castlecomer would have been the central point for communities living in these areas to access services.  They are real communities.  I find it extraordinary that Bus &Eacute;ireann states it is not prepared to reveal plans to withdraw services from rural areas such as these because of commercial sensitivities.  The main problem is that most people see Bus &Eacute;ireann and CIE as public service vehicles.  Its representatives may try to explain that they have a commercial non-subsidised service, but people simply see a bus that has been providing a service since the 1930s.  They find it impossible to comprehend a decision can be made without local consultation.  I pay tribute to a colleague, Councillor Pat Fitzpatrick from outside Castlecomer, who was the first person to find this out.  The chances are, as Mr. Nolan says, that he found out through some of the staff.  The rumours were then picked up by the <i>Kilkenny People<\/i>and local media and the campaign to seek clarification and retain the services started.  The same happened with the route through Bunclody and Wicklow where Councillor Barbara-Anne Murphy repeatedly tried to make contact with Mr. Nolan's office and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Eventually, some response was received.<\/p><p>The role of the NTA is crucial.  If, as we are hearing, Bus &Eacute;ireann must wash its face with the Expressway routes and will progressively withdraw services from rural towns and villages, there must be a social role the NTA should fill.  It is rather interesting that in both presentations today there were regular references to matters being subject to finance or a lack of finance.  Therefore, the question is what is the role of the Government and the Department.  Do the delegaes agree that there is a need for increased resources to ensure that when there is a withdrawal of services from rural Ireland, alternatives are put in place?  I would like them to clarify the position on route 7 out of Bunclody.  My understanding is that it does not currently operate on any motorway.  Bus &Eacute;ireann made the point that, as part of its social dividend, it provided Expressway connections to many of the secondary locations which have now been bypassed on foot of the expanding motorway network.  That might be clarified as I understand route 7 does not run along a motorway.  It provides a service for students and people attending hospital appointments and doing various other things.  What are they going to do now that the service has been withdrawn?<\/p><p>Perhaps this is a question I should direct to Ms Graham and the NTA.  What are the NTA's plans in this matter?  It states, in relation to route 7, that a working group of representatives has been established.  That is a positive development, but it should not result in hundreds of people turning up at public meetings once the news starts to break in a local community.  More than 200 people came out in Bunclody, more than 300 in Castlecomer and more than 200 in Athy.  These are people who will be adversely affected by the withdrawal of services.  What is the role of the NTA in this context?  What services is it going to provide to meet the needs of rural communities?  It states it will shortly engage actively with the group, that a replacement service has been finalised and that local representatives will be briefed in the next week on the proposals to be made.<\/p><p>Does it see a role for the extension of licences to private operators under the PSO to provide feeder services to larger communities?  Even if they were to use minibuses or small buses, that might prove viable.  <\/p><p> What is the funding mechanism for access for those with travel passes?  I understand the Department of Social Protection withdrew funding for services on PSO routes and that if it does negotiate with the NTA for a licence to operate such a service, the operator cannot pick up passengers with travel passes.  Will the delegates clarify this because I have not been able to obtain a clear answer from the Department?  How is the subsidy spent and is it true that a private operator granted a licence will not be allowed to pick up passengers with travel passes?  When one considers the demographics in rural Ireland, where there is a large number of elderly people, that seems to be counter-productive.<\/p><p> What will Mr. Nolan do about the withdrawal of services?  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann see itself as having any obligation whatsoever to provide alternative services, or is it just the case that it will operate end to end between large centres and effectively cut out the rest of rural Ireland of any transport service alternative?  Is it its role to address this, or is it the role of the NTA and, ultimately, the Government?  Is it a question of resources?  If Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA had enough money from the Exchequer, would they be able to provide alternative services in those rural areas where services are being withdrawn?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#E00700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1249,"content":"<p>To start with the question about resources, we have a current budget assigned for PSO services that has been fully allocated to our existing contracts.  Similarly under the rural transport programme, even following the restructuring, the funding associated with rural transport is allocated to services being provided.  We would need further funding in order to be able to provide additional services, which is what we want to do.  We will put our proposals to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to assist us.  If we had more funding, we could provide more services.  That is the position we want to be in, to grow rural transport services and respond quickly to the challenges posed by the withdrawal of commercial services, not just Bus &Eacute;ireann services but also those provided by other commercial operators.<\/p> <p>  We support the setting up of a local working group because it gives us an opportunity to meet a group of representatives and work with them on solutions.  We have solutions we can put forward, but they know their areas and the demand for services better than we do.

The bottom line here is that there is a public responsibility to give equal transport access to everybody in this country.  I wonder if we have a lack of communication and co-ordination at the moment between the National Transport Authority, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the private operators and rural community transport.  We need to maximise the benefits on a cost-benefit basis for provision of services to everybody.  There may be a need for a national review and an evaluation of where we are going.  It appears to be a bit haphazard at the moment.  We have to fair to everybody.  An excellent service is being provided by the community transport companies, which they have developed over a number of years.  They have targeted remote areas that would normally be deprived of services.  Is there a plan for co-ordinating with and feeding into the higher levels of transport, like the expressways, from the smaller communities on to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann?<\/p> <p>  What marketing and public relations work is being done for all the services?  We cannot forget our tourism product.  The tourism industry in peripheral areas such as the west and south west, where we probably have the most tourists outside Dublin, should be given a quality service.  Tourism is expected to be up 10% in 2014 and may go up again in 2015.  We need to move forward in a well-devised fashion to ensure there is good connectivity and communication with our peripheral areas.  We have a lot to work on.  The witnesses may need to be sitting around a table more often and planning their strategy properly because, as I said, there is an obligation to give everyone an equal service.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of local issues, for example, a bus going from Tralee to Ballydavid, west of Dingle, one of the greatest visitor areas in the country.  It is scheduled to go into Ballydavid village but is not doing so.  I ask that this be rectified immediately as it is depriving the local consumers as well as visitors coming into the area.  There are rumours that the Killarney to Rathmore service may be abandoned.  That is a very important route in the area which goes on into Millstreet and Macroom and also provides connectivity with Mallow and the city of Cork.

That gives us the opportunity to look across all service provision and plan the resources to ensure the links are better made between the services.  We continually review services on an area-by-area basis and just did a public consultation on services in County Mayo in respect of how we might better use the existing services there to try and meet local demand.  We hope to continue that on a county-by-county basis using the resources of the transport co-ordination units.  We are very well placed to do the type of review the Deputy has indicated.

My second question is for Ms Graham.   From 2010 to 2014, what sort of cuts have been made to the NTA's budget?  What are the figures?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Nolan said that Bus &Eacute;ireann made a profit on the Expressway, and I would like to know what profit was made.  Anybody will know that in business you win some and lose some and you have to sort of take the good with the bad.  It is not just down to a simple matter.  Mr. Nolan spoke about different parts of rural Ireland, how Bus &Eacute;ireann is trying to help as much as it can, but he must also realise we have come through a fairly rough time, although going by the indications, there is all hope that the improvement is spreading out now.  What I get from Mr. Nolan is that Bus &Eacute;ireann is about to kill the goose that is going to lay the golden egg.  Things are starting to move on out towards different parts of rural Ireland, which had not seen an improvement up to now, and the sooner we see it the better.  Bus &Eacute;ireann may be making a decision too early.  In business as in any walk of life we have to take good and bad.  Mr. Nolan cannot give us a figure for exactly what Bus &Eacute;ireann was losing.  Overall, from what I understand, it is making a profit.  It is also making a profit on the school bus routes even though ten or 12 years ago some schools decided to amalgamate together - the goalposts have been changed in the last few years in some of that.<\/p><p>If we decide that a service will not go up a road where there is one house to deliver a letter, something is taken away.  An Post was mentioned.  Bus &Eacute;ireann seems to be taking the same attitude.  Basically, if the service is doing well, that is great, but if the service is not doing as well, it is time to say \"Goodbye\".  We welcome motorways and faster travel times but should everybody not play on a level field?  When the National Transport Authority, NTA, is giving out licences, should it not stipulate the towns to be serviced?  Anybody in a business will go for the most lucrative and shortest routes.  Should we not examine such issues?<\/p><p> Deputies Naughten and Feighan are also here.  I have spoken to people in Leitrim.  We have talked about rural transport and people trying to get to hospitals but such transport does not exist.  I welcome the comments that the witnesses will sit down with councillors and public representatives in each affected county.  There is a craving for services out there.  Meetings may help resolve the issues we have talked about today and a proper service would help to revive different towns.  We cannot just look at the short term or drop the hatchet.  The sun may be coming over the horizon but it seems people want to pull the shield down on it.  Some of these actions must be reconsidered.  People pay tax in all parts of the country and it is our taxes that subsidise what these companies are doing.  We have spoken about the routes and school runs, and taxes subsidise those services.  I am not talking about a single part of Ireland but all the country, and we deserve services in different parts of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#J00600","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1323,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation from Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA before us this morning.

People live in these communities, and as Deputies and Senators have said, they need a proper service.

In my county of Cork, there was an office set up in Bantry for the entire county.  The distance from Bantry to north Cork is probably twice the length of some counties.

Customers who wish to obtain an Expressway service need to go to Nenagh.  I have never had to avail of the service, for which I am glad, given my limited observations.  I recall being in Nenagh two years ago.  As the bus was about to leave, a woman honked her horn and flashed her lights to indicate that she had a passenger for it, but the bus pulled off.  I was going home via Birdhill, so I went that far and asked the bus driver why he had pulled off when there was obviously a passenger to be picked up.  I appreciate that it is Seachtain na Gaeilge, but the answer I received would not be readily translatable into Irish.<\/p> <p>  As a common citizen, I wrote to Bus &Eacute;ireann about this matter and received no reply.  Then I wrote as an elected representative and was assured that the matter would be investigated in the normal course of events and I would be informed of what happened.  I did not hear anything.<\/p> <p>  The next encounter I had with Bus &Eacute;ireann in Nenagh was to bring a passenger to the bus.  I arrived approximately two minutes before time.  I appreciate that perhaps I should have arrived an hour beforehand, seeing as how Mr. Nolan compared Expressway with Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  However, I arrived ahead of time, as did a group of other people.  We were told by someone else that the bus had left five minutes before time.  I was not alone in this.  I am not the only one who has had these misfortunate episodes in Nenagh while seeking to avail of an Expressway service.  I wrote to the company outlining that the bus had left at least five minutes before its scheduled time and that there was a group of people present.  I gave the company the contact details of the other people because I bothered to take them.  I am still waiting for a reply.<\/p> <p>  If Mr. Nolan wants to compare Bus &Eacute;ireann with Aer Lingus and Ryanair, he is free to do so, even though it might be a little bit ambitious, but Ryanair is learning that customer service is important.  It at least replies, albeit not very well, to some customer service queries.  I do not expect the witnesses to reply to the specifics I have raised, but is there someone among them to whom I can send all of this correspondence and expect a reply?<\/p><p>I appreciate sometimes buses can be delayed and that it is no fault of the bus driver.

No effort is being made to make bus routes viable.  I accept the point made by Ms Graham that the PSO budget has been cut and more funding needs to put into this.  For example, Bus &Eacute;ireann announced it was a case of \"use it or lose it\" for route 21, the Westport-Athlone service.  That same week, the Department of Social Protection, which has its own budget, announced it was closing its community welfare clinic in Ballinlough, County Roscommon, and people have to access that service in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  Now people who badly need to get to the community welfare clinic in Castlerea will have to pay for a taxi to get there which will have to be funded by the Exchequer although there was a public transport service in place before.  It is the same problem for Rooskie where the Rooskie-Dromod bus service was removed last year and at the end of this month the community welfare clinic will be closed in Rooskie.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking between all of the State agencies involved.<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham needs to start banging heads together to trash out some of these issues.  I accept Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to look at the commercial test of its routes.  I know there have been huge changes because of the development of the motorways which has had an impact on services.  Ireland West Airport Knock has dramatically increased its passenger numbers with 1.1 million people going through it last year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, however, is looking at reducing services to the airport, not expanding them.  While Bus &Eacute;ireann expands services into Dublin Airport, it is withdrawing services from Knock rather than enhancing them.<\/p> <p>  The county hospital in Roscommon closed in 2011.  What discussions have taken place to date with the Health Service Executive, HSE, on this?  People in Roscommon now have to go for hospital appointments to Castlebar, Portiuncula and Galway.  A patient from Roscommon can get to Galway for an afternoon appointment but will not be able to get a bus home.  It is the same for Castlebar while one would have to wait until 4.30 p.m. for the return service from Portiuncula.<\/p> <p>  What discussions has the National Transport Authority, NTA, had with the HSE on facilitating transport to and from clinics and the timing of appointments?  For example, have the staff making appointments in each of those hospitals been given a copy of that timetable booklet produced by the NTA?  This would allow appointments to be scheduled to ensure patients, particularly older people, can get to them by accessing public transport rather than having to pay &euro;150 to &euro;200 for a taxi.  Does it not make more sense for such an integrated public transport approach rather than paying &euro;200 per taxi, some of it paid for by the State?  Providing such a transport service would also ensure people get to appointments in the first place, reduce do-not-shows, speed up access to treatment, reduce pressure on accident and emergency departments and the ambulance service and the chaos that causes, as well as reducing the financial impact these have across the operation of the health service.<\/p> <p>  It is frustrating for me that for the past 20 years we have all been talking about the need for joined-up thinking between all State and community agencies to link and maximise the use of services.  For the past 15 years, I have heard there will be co-ordination between the transport agencies and the HSE regarding hospital appointments but nothing seems to be happening.  All I see are more services reduced and, unless one is going to Dublin, one can forget about it.  There is the odd service to the likes of Galway and Sligo but forget about anywhere else.  It will not happen because it is not commercially viable even though the majority of services in the greater Dublin area are not commercially viable either.  They will continue but rural Ireland can forget about its services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#M00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>I do not have the figures for how the PSO is split between the greater Dublin area and outside it.

I agree we must do more in rural areas at making the services more efficient and to improve the integration of services to local hospitals.  The work has to happen on the ground locally to meet those demands for services.

I said this morning on Radio Kerry that the fact that the witnesses are coming to this meeting makes this one of the most important meetings ever held by the committee due to the importance of what we are discussing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Moynihan hit the nail on the head earlier by asking what services are being cut in Dublin and whether all of the routes in Dublin are making money.  The answer, clearly, was that Bus &Eacute;ireann is cutting nothing in Dublin.  It has loss-making routes in Dublin but it will not dare touch them.  However, the rest of the country, particularly rural Ireland, is fair game to be attacked.  It has lost its social welfare offices, Garda stations, post offices, shops and small pubs.  The next thing it is faced with is losing its bus service.  Over the last number of weeks I have been contacted by elderly people in particular, and users of the bus service in north, south, east and mid-Kerry to ask me if they will lose their bus service.  It is incumbent on the witnesses to tell us.<\/p> <p>  Our job as public representatives is to help and assist people in our communities.  We should know if services are going to be threatened, cut or reconfigured, to use the word used by the witness.  It is a word I would love to see the back of.  The HSE use it all of the time, saying it is reconfiguring its service.  Can people not just speak plain English and say they are cutting the service?  We are talking about a very important service and the people who have been in contact with me, and indeed other representatives, are deeply worried.<\/p><p>I want to know, for instance, if Bus &Eacute;ireann is looking at cutting services to Waterville, mid-Kerry and east Kerry.  I want to know in advance - as will my colleagues in Kerry, be they county councillors, Senators or TDs - what Bus &Eacute;ireann is thinking of doing and what it is proposing, because we want an opportunity to react beforehand, not afterwards.  I do not want to pick up a newspaper and read that such and such a service is cut or hear on Radio Kerry that such and such a service has been cut and the public will be let down.  We cannot have that.  It is not fair on Bus &Eacute;ireann's customers, who have relied on its service and who have been grateful for it.<\/p><p> Everybody has their own take on it.  I am not all negative.  I compliment Bus &Eacute;ireann on the service it runs.  Its representatives heard a negative story a while ago.  In my experience of Bus &Eacute;ireann's employees who drive the buses and those in Tralee who run the services, they are extremely professional, very courteous and good at their job.  I really mean that, because it is wrong to paint such a picture, although the Deputy was not doing that.  I would not want an impression to go out from here that Bus &Eacute;ireann gives a substandard service or that its drivers are not excellent, because my experience is the exact opposite, and I want to acknowledge that.<\/p><p> We have a chance to create awareness in these areas.  If this involves parts of Kerry, about which I am speaking specifically, I want to know Bus &Eacute;ireann's proposals and its representatives' thinking, because we want to save services if possible.<\/p><p> We have lost so much in rural areas over the years.  In the past there were politicians who decided it was a good idea to break up the rural rail network.  When we look back on that, it was a crazy decision.  For instance, if the railway line that went down into Cahirciveen was open today, it would change the county completely from both a tourism and a business point of view.  That happened all over Ireland at that time and it was a shame.  It should not have happened.  I do not want history to repeat itself.<\/p><p> I do not want us to lose services now because if we lose a service we will not get it back.  It is the same as the post office that closes or the pub that shuts down.  We will not get it back.  It does not work that way.  Whatever falls off the radar is gone and gone forever.  That is why we cherish and appreciate the service Bus &Eacute;ireann gives.<\/p><p> I appreciate and acknowledge the importance of commercial viability, but at the end of the day Bus &Eacute;ireann provides a public service, and we want that to continue.  The buses might not be full but the passengers who use them want that service.  They need and require it, and they rely on it.  I cannot stress enough how upsetting it would be for the passengers, not all of whom are elderly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#N02000","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1390,"content":"<p>There are others waiting to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#O00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1391,"content":"<p>I have been contacted by those who use the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus service for going to work and they are worried about what will happen.

I apologise for having to step out at one stage.  As a result, I missed one or two of the answers.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Graham and Mr. Nolan will be aware from our previous meetings, there are two main areas that impact on my constituents in Kildare South.  The first is Athy and the region to the north - route 7.  The other is the route along the old N7, now the R448, on which Bus &Eacute;ireann has not operated for a number of years.  J. J. Kavanagh used to operate a bus service on that route, but as of January it has withdrawn from it and now stays on the motorway.  This is a serious issue for the people of Castledermot, Moone, Timolin and Crookstown.  Those are two significant issues that need addressing.<\/p> <p>  The myth perpetrated by some commentators nationally that urban areas such as Dublin subsidise rural areas can be put to bed here, because we mentioned already how many of the routes in Dublin are public service obligations, PSO, and have their own challenges.  That argument, from commentators outside of this room, is not helpful.<\/p> <p>  My constituents are affected, particularly in the Castledermot area.  It has an impact on the young, from the point of view of students who need to get to college by travelling either south to Carlow or Waterford, or north to Dublin.  At the other end of the spectrum, older people have health appointments that need to be fulfilled.  This is also a significant issue in Athy, on route 7.<\/p> <p>  There is a sense that decisions the NTA makes do have consequences.  When the decision was made to grant Dublin Coach a licence to operate a direct route from Waterford to Dublin and then J. J. Kavanagh sought to change his licence to pull out of the Castledermot element of that route and stay on the motorway, those decisions had a knock-on effect.  I was struck by the presentation from Mr. Nolan from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There are a couple of phases that he repeats.  He talks about \"cherry-picking\" of routes and \"increased availability of commercial licences,\" and says, \"We cannot trade recklessly.\"  Decisions that are made about the liberalisation of routes have a consequence that could cost the taxpayer a fortune in increasing PSOs, because the alternative, which is not an option for anybody, is that we end up abandoning these areas.  It leaves the taxpayer with a fairly difficult decision and a growing bill for PSO, from the &euro;209 million mentioned earlier.  Will the NTA accept that decisions it makes have the knock-on effect of making certain areas not viable?  How can we avoid that in the future?<\/p> <p>  What analysis has the NTA done of options for the Castledermot route - the old N9 - and how long will it be before we have potential solutions?  This is even more time-critical than the Athy issue in that, since January last, we have lost seven or eight routes out of the Castledermot area.  Are there solutions for Athy on route 7 and how quickly will those be in place?  Perhaps the witnesses outlined that earlier, but I did not see it in the presentation.  If a PSO is the answer to route 7, will free travel pass holders be able to use them on future PSOs?<\/p> <p>  I missed the answer to Deputy Moynihan's question about the legislation stopping school transport procurement.  I concur with Deputy Denis Naughten.  I have worked closely with local rural transport in south Kildare, both in my time as a councillor and more recently, and am aware of the level of frustration experienced by some providers of rural transport in engaging with the HSE on simple matters such as co-ordinating times for a route to link in with the warfarin clinic in Naas.  Patients will be aware weeks in advance that they have an appointment at the warfarin clinic, and it is a matter of getting the times co-ordinated so that the bus can run at the same time.  Those who want to do their shopping can use that rural transport instead of incurring taxi costs, while significant costs for the taxpayer, through the HSE, for taxi bills can be avoided.  That particular matter was addressed to an extent, but not before a lot of heartache.  Leaving it to the local areas will not work.<\/p> <p>  We have been told there are difficulties with the legislation pertaining to school transport, and we need to know what those are.  As far as I know, everyone in this House would wish to maximise the use of school buses, which always do half their run empty.  Everyone in this House would wish to see maximum engagement, with Departments talking to each other in order to ensure that HSE does not spend millions of euro on needless taxi bills when there is a rural transport network that needs bums on seats to survive and that is quite flexible, in as far as it can be, in adapting.  If the NTA will not lead the charge on that, then I do not know who will.  The NTA should come back and tell us if the HSE is not giving it the information or if other State bodies are not doing so.  We are depending on the NTA to take the lead on this because we need to see improvements on that.<\/p> <p>  The solution here is not PSOs that will cost hundreds of thousands of euro.  We could cover the country in PSOs and have buses travelling half-empty much of the time.  We need to think bigger than that.  The impact on tourism and other sectors is key.  Those are my main points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#O00400","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1393,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late, as I had other business to attend to.<\/p> <p>  My concern centres on Laois and south Kildare.<\/p><p>Laois and south Kildare have been abandoned by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The old N8 route through Abbeyleix, Durrow, Cullahill and south of Abbeyleix is now not served, and that applies all the way down into County Kilkenny.  The old N7 route of Mountrath, Castletown and Borris-in-Ossory, which was then the Pike of Rushall and Borris-in-Ossory route is now gone.  The N78 route comprises Athy, Ballylinan, Pedigree Corner, Doonane, Crettyard and Castlecomer.  That service was due to go this month.  We held some meetings in Athy, including one that Ms Graham and Mr. Nolan attended the other night, where agreement was reached that Bus &Eacute;ireann would stay on the route until 31 June.  After that, the buses use the motorways and almost all the geographical area of the county and a huge tract of south Kildare will be left without any bus service.  That is unacceptable.  The towns and villages in the region have been abandoned.  The remaining few on the N78 route of Athy, Ballylinan, Pedigree Corner, Doonane, Crettyard and Castlecomer are about to be abandoned.<\/p><p> We must organise a public transport system that works.  I recognise one cannot run a bus up every boreen and that one cannot have the same level of service in a rural area as one does for a busy urban route.  That said, it should not be beyond us to provide a basic bus service to run along the main arteries and to connect people from local villages with urban locations for their hospital appointments, work, college and whatever else.  We must have an integrated approach and link up services while taking account of HSE hospitals appointments, working hours, etc.  We also need an integrated approach to building a bus service.  If we stick a plaster on the problem, all we will do is limp from one crisis to another.  A service will be provided for a while but when it is discovered that it does not work, the service will stop.  Therefore, we need to plan strategic routes and use them strategically in terms of times and so on.<\/p><p> Promotional work must also be done.  I am sure Mr. Martin Nolan of Bus &Eacute;ireann will tell me differently and that it has spent a certain amount on advertising.  Local advertising of a bus service has not been done.  I have not seen it done but perhaps it has passed me by.  I suggest that bus timetables and routes be published in parish newsletters.<\/p><p> We need bus stops because there is often only three bus stops every 15 to 20 miles of road.  We need secondary bus stops at places like Pedigree Corner and along such routes, and the same applies for Pike of Rushall and all of those areas.<\/p><p> We need bus shelters.  It rained very heavily as I travelled here this morning.  I have noticed that the bus shelters in Dublin are state of the art.  I argue that rural Ireland should get small areas where a bus can pull into and bus shelters can be located.  I visited the North last weekend and little perspex shelters have been erected all along the roadway of rural routes.  We must provide the same in the South or people will not use the bus service.  We need to have a planned integrated service.  <\/p><p> The immediate issue in County Laois is that it is not served by public transport.  The immediate threat is to the bus service on the N78 route and, therefore, we need a plan.  I understand, from what the National Transport Authority said that its main remit is licensing.  Somebody must solve this problem.  The Department will not do it or cannot do it and civil servants do not see it as a job for them.  We need to plan strategic routes which I see as a key job for the NTA.  If the NTA does not have the resources to do so, then it is up to us, in these Houses, to give resources to the authority.  That is the most important task.  We must also knock heads together to get a co-ordinated approach.  <\/p><p> I have questions for each organisation.  What subvention does Bus &Eacute;ireann receive?  It gets subvention for social welfare passes, and rightly so.  How much direct subvention does the organisation receive from the Government?<\/p><p> My next questions are for the National Transport Authority.  Its role is licensing, but what else does it do?  What has it planned for County Laois and south Kildare?  The issue of the N78 route must be addressed urgently.  We must retain the service and the witnesses know that from their attendance at the public meeting in Athy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#O00500","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late but I was in the Chamber participating in the marriage equality debate.

The bus stops outside my office in Castlemaine and people often come into my office seeking information on bus timetables and services, which we provide.

We have carried out a review of services in Kerry.  We are working closely with Bus &Eacute;ireann to deliver what we would hope would be an improved service in Kerry.  Prior to us implementing the initiative, Members will have the details beforehand.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the decisions that we make and the knock-on consequences of licensing decisions that Deputy Heydon mentioned, and in terms of looking at licences and licence applications, we want to provide an increased and better service for public transport customers.  We also want to grow public transport numbers.  By looking at the services in that way, we have had to refuse licences in some cases where we felt it could undermine the provision of services between those licensed services.  We feel it is not a consequence of the number of licences, more a consequence of the roads structure and infrastructure and also the demand by customers for quicker end-to-end journeys.  That is what has influenced the types of licence applications we have received and the types of decisions we have had to make.  As a result, Bus &Eacute;ireann has had to review the provision of its licensed services to respond to those changes.  It is our responsibility to see what is needed if there are places left without a public transport service.  While we have a responsibility in regulating licences, we also have a responsibility to see if there is a public service obligation in an area that requires to be met by a public transport service.<\/p> <p>  As we have indicated before, we have been limited by our level of funding in delivering more services.<\/p><p>We are grateful that the level of funding has stabilised in terms of the subsidy going into services.

As he is aware, it has been difficult, even locally, to integrate HSE and rural transport services.  However, we will continue to try to do this locally.  In addition, we will do whatever we can nationally in order to try to ensure that public transport services meet the needs of those of our customers with health issues.<\/p><p> When we draw up plans in respect of a replacement service for route 7, we will implement them as soon as possible.  A meeting of the working group is due to take place in the next week and we will be attending that.  A date for that meeting has not yet been decided upon but I am sure this will be done in the next couple of days.  We will bring forward our proposals at the meeting in question.  We must also be aware that there may be changes to the commercial services - even beyond those already planned - which we will also be obliged to consider in the context of what we will put in place.  However, we are actively drawing up plans and we will be ready to meet the working group in the coming days.  We hope that we will be in a position to put in place whatever solutions are agreed.  Again, this will be subject to the necessary funding being made available.  We will try to put the solutions to which I refer in place as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> On the question of what happens if free travel pass holders avail of what might be replacement services, the answer is that it would depend on the nature of those services.  As I indicated earlier, a cap has been put in place in respect of the free travel scheme and any new services cannot avail of a subsidy from the scheme in order to allow holders of the pass to travel for free.  Unfortunately, in certain instances where we have put in place some replacement PSO services, we have been obliged to charge concessionary fares.  Whether we will be obliged to do that in this case, we are not yet sure but it might be part of the consideration in terms of replacement PSO services along route 7.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley referred to having an integrated approach.  We want to bring such an approach to bear in the context of planning for services.  We are of the view that we are the only authority which can do so.  We want to continue to work on trying to integrate existing services and on using our resources more effectively.  In addition, we also want to plan for areas where we may need to deliver additional services.<\/p><p> In the context of infrastructure, we are aware that we need to put in place further bus stops and shelters.  However, we are limited in this regard in terms of the level of funding available and we must prioritise in the context of where we can deliver these infrastructure items.  We will be undertaking a process of putting in place new bus stops - at which integrated information will be available - throughout the country.  We are also working towards trying to integrate the stops as well in order that all providers will use the same stops.  This will, however, take a number of years to roll out.  In the context of bus shelters, we are similarly constrained by the level of resources available.  Again, we have been obliged to prioritise where we use those resources in order to put new shelter infrastructure in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426066200,"counter":1399,"content":"<p>Ms Graham stated that the company is going to improve bus services in Kerry.

What is the position regarding replacement services in circumstances where Bus &Eacute;ireann provides a subsidised service?<\/p> <p>  I accept that the company is constrained in the context of resources - Ms Graham and I have discussed this issue on many occasions - but some of the shelters erected at bus stops are huge and could easily accommodate 20 people.  However, the most one would ever see at such stops is one, two or three individuals.  What are needed at bus stops in rural areas are simple structures that would perhaps be one quarter the size of those currently being erected.  These shelters should face away from the road in order that people would be protected from the spray caused by trucks, etc.  I saw one such structure when passing through Strabane in recent days and all it involves is a few upright sheets of Perspex with a small, slanted roof on top.  In addition, the shelter in question faces away from the road.  The entire structure was not much more than 1 m in length by 0.5 m in depth and I am sure the cost relating to it was extremely low.  I stopped to inspect it and discovered that information relating to all bus services on the route was provided on the sign attached to it.  The shelter is small and was obviously cheap to construct.<\/p> <p>  Some of the shelters built by Adshel in this jurisdiction are extremely big.  I accept that these are required in places such as Monasterevin because there could be 20 or 30 people queuing for a bus at any given time.  In some rural areas, however, one might only see one, two or three people queuing at bus stops.  All that would be needed at such stops is simple structure that would prevent the spray from lorries from hitting people in the queue.  If a shelter faces out into the road, people can often be splashed by spray from passing vehicles.  If the back of the shelter faces outward, however, protection is provided.  I reiterate my point that all that is required at bus stops in many rural areas is a simple structure with a small, tilted roof on top.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#Q01300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1411,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, the free travel scheme has been capped for the past number of years.  If a new commercial operator comes in to operate a service, it cannot currently avail of a payment under the scheme.  The operator would be obliged to make a decision as to whether it will allow pass holders to travel for free or whether it will be obliged to charge them the full fare.  That is a commercial decision which it must make.  In the context of replacement services in circumstances where we are providing a subsidised, PSO-contracted service, as the Deputy is aware, we were not able to avail of any subsidy under the free travel scheme in respect of the service we provided between Cashel and Portlaoise.  In order to make the service as viable as possible, we were obliged to charge a concessionary fare - half the normal adult fare - in respect of free travel pass holders.  It would depend on what services are being proposed in the context of replacement services.  We may be faced with the same kind of decision if we cannot access a subsidy under the free travel scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015031100002#Q01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426066200,"counter":1412,"content":"<p>On any services we provide or are contracted to provide, we will accept DSP passes.

As Ms Graham said, Bus &Eacute;ireann hires thousands of buses every day and we use the appropriate bus.<\/p> <p>  The major issue with regard to fuel economy is the driver.  One driver can be 20% more expensive than other.  We have telematics, engine cut-off at lights if the engine is idling, and defensive driving programmes.  We are looking at systems all the time.  The new Euro 6 engines are related more to emissions as they use as much fuel as the old buses.  They are not fuel economic.  We also have spill-free systems going into depots so we are conscious of that end of things.
