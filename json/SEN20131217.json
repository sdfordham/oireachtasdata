Given we will later today see the publication of the Government's economic plan and strategy for the coming years following the bailout exit, it might also be appropriate to have the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in the House in the new year to debate that plan so we can tease out with him the detail of it.  As always, there is a frenzy of legislation in the last week or two of the Christmas term - it happened under the last Government and it seems to happen under every Government.  This is unfortunate because we should have more time for considered debate.  I know the Leader is doing his very best to ensure we do, which why we sat so late last night.

Currently, some &euro;50 million is being taken out of rural Ireland, in particular because of the \"eye in the sky\", whereby large tracts of farmland in severely disadvantaged areas are being taken out of the equation for disadvantaged area scheme payments and some people are losing 20% or 30% of their payments.  This is a retrograde step and is most unfortunate.<\/p><p>Historically, farmers were advised not to overstock.  Area-based payments were then brought in and farmers in remote parts of rural Ireland were advised to keep their scrub and hedgerows, to protect wildlife and the environment and to leave things as they were.  They were asked to protect the frogs in the ponds and the corncrake, if there are any of them left, although I know there are a few in Cape Clear, and to protect the birds and the bees.  Now, all of a sudden, the most disadvantaged farms are being hit with this new clawback.<\/p><p>It is a very serious issue which will take &euro;50 million out of the economy of rural Ireland.  It particularly hits the most disadvantaged areas.  I am sure my good colleague, Senator Comiskey, will know that many farmers in Leitrim are also being hit.  It does not affect the farmer who has 100 acres of good land for tillage or for intensive dairy farming.  It is a sneaky cut.<\/p><p>I am not looking for the impossible, namely, that we would have a debate before Christmas.  However, I ask that, as early in the new year as possible, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, would come to the House for a general debate on farming, in particular the position with regard to CAP, Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, where the area-based schemes are going into the future and why the most vulnerable farmers are being hit coming up to Christmas.<\/p><p>A woman who has a very small holding contacted me last week to tell me her entire holding has been disallowed because there are too many bushes, outcrops of rock and so on.<\/p> <p>If we go down that road, two thirds of farmers in remote rural areas will be excluded.<\/p><p>Another area in which farmers are being hit is in respect of the farm assist scheme.  It has now transpired that more than 1,000 owners of relatively small farms throughout the country, for whom the farm assist is equivalent to a social welfare benefit, have been deemed ineligible or had their payment reduced because of a change in the welfare regime.  This arises because the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in last year's budget, stealthily introduced a provision whereby these small farmers, instead of being assessed on 70% of their income, would now be assessed on 100% of that income.  The result is that 1,000 farmers who were in receipt of farm assist 18 months ago have lost their entitlement or had their payment severely curtailed.  Farming has been badly hit as we come up to Christmas.  I hope the Leader will, as soon as we return in January, facilitate a full day's debate on a range of issues relating to farming, including the Common Agricultural Policy and the various agricultural schemes.  It would be a worthwhile exercise and I am sure the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, will learn a great deal from the expertise of colleagues in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700003#B01600","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387276800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>RTE will air an investigative programme tonight, the findings of which are already in the public domain, showing how users of an unregulated drug detox service provided by a voluntary organisation were engaged in fund-raising activities for up to 18 hours per day.  This raises the obvious issues regarding the regulation of charities, which we have already discussed in this House and which I have asked to be addressed early in the new year.  In addition, however, it raises a critical issue regarding the lack of facilities for drug users who wish to become drug-free and the failure to regulate certain facilities.  In this instance, it seems that people who availed of a treatment programme did not, in fact, receive any medical treatment or counselling.  Indeed, the report suggests their lives were put at risk by, for example, the failure to provide appropriate methadone support and so on.<\/p><p>We have had many debates in this House about the need for vigilance when it comes to the protection of vulnerable people, particularly children and older people.  Acute drug users are also very vulnerable and the facilities that provide drug treatment services must be properly regulated.  It is obvious to anybody who has ever worked in this area that many of those who end up in drug rehabilitation programmes are from very troubled backgrounds, including care backgrounds.  Many of them end up spending time in prison during their lifetime.  The drug treatment system and the way in which it is managed and regulated is not adequate to the need that exists.  If a person who presented at hospital with a threat to his or her life because of a serious heart condition did not receive the treatment he or she needed, there would be a national outrage.

However, it would be a shame not to debate some of those issues.  For example, Senator Barrett tabled a recommendation on the development of electric cars, which we did not reach.

The question arises as to whether charities that receive in excess of 80% of their funding from the State - some of them being in receipt of &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million - should be called charities or should instead be considered non-governmental organisations coming within the remit of the HSE.

What was disappointing in the response was that there was not full disclosure to the health committee, even though the question I tabled was very detailed.  The question specifically asked if the HSE was aware of any additional moneys being paid to senior management.  I received a generic response.  It said there were irregularities, but no details were furnished.  That is a case of not answering the questions from Members of this House.  It was a detailed question and the HSE had six weeks to respond.  It had all the information by 30 September, but it was not given to the health committee.

In other words, &euro;1.69 billion goes to eight organisations.  We can have all the charities regulators we like, but what we do not have on the boards of these organisations are nominees from the Department of Health, the HSE or any government agency.  It is time to examine and debate the system of governance of these organisations.  We must put in place a structure that entitles the Minister or the HSE to nominate representatives to these boards.  A total of &euro;1.69 billion is going to eight organisations, yet there is no government nominee on any of their boards.  That is the issue we must debate now.

I was delighted when Roscommon County Council amended its county development plan yesterday in order to stipulate that wind turbines must be located 1,500 m from people's homes.  I congratulate the county councillors involved on doing that.  The multiplier used in this case was the height of a turbine multiplied by ten.

The additional two and a half hours I have provided for debating the Bill today are more than adequate.  <\/p><p>Senators Whelan and Kelly raised new planning regulations for electricity pylons and wind turbines.  I understand a public consultation process is under way.  This matter will be dealt with by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Communications and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, whom I will invite to the House in January or early February for a debate to ensure Senators have an opportunity to participate in the public consultation process. <\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of top-up payments and the lack of transparency shown by the Health Service Executive in reply to members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It is regrettable that full replies have not been provided to members of a committee, as it would be in the case of any Member of the House.  The Senator also questioned the governance of boards that are funded by the State.  All of us will share his concerns about large sums of money being allocated to organisations which do not have proper governance structures in place and in which the State does not play a role.  This is not acceptable.  <\/p><p>Senator Crown proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to have No. 18 taken before No. 1 to allow his Bill to be debated tomorrow evening.  While I have no problem in accepting his amendment, I ask Senators who are moving Private Members' Bills to give more notice.  Perhaps they could give a week's notice rather than one day's notice when a Bill is being introduced.  I will accede to Senator Crown's request in this matter. <\/p><p>Senator Wilson raised the issue of mobile telephone networks.  I will make inquiries of the Minister to ascertain the position in that regard and ring the Senator back.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700006#E01900","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387278600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>The Leader has agreed to extend discussion of the Pyrite Resolution Bill by 20 minutes.

The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, raised two crucial issues on Second Stage.  He recognised that the creation of a register containing all the information about potential losses and risks for lenders and borrowers is crucial to ensuring that mistakes are not repeated.  The bank intends to take a phased approach to the establishment and development of the register.  It has suggested that the indicative timeline for the implementation phase will be over the period 2015 to 2016.  It is anticipated that 2014 and much of 2015 will be spent in procuring, developing and testing the technical solution, in partnership with all relevant stakeholders, with data supplied on a phased basis over the course of late 2015 and early 2016.  The indicative timeline will be dependent on the enactment of the Bill and for this reason the Government is very grateful to the House for the very constructive approach it has taken.<\/p><p>We gave a commitment to the troika that this Bill would be enacted by the end of this year and the House has ensured that we will fulfil this commitment to make regulatory changes to the country's banking structure.  Assuming the House agrees to the Final Stage, that first commitment will be in place by the end of 2013.  The successful development of a technical solution to which I referred, is a big public procurement issue which we need to get right.  We hope it will be in place by the end of next year.  Credit information providers will need to change their procedures in order to meet all of the challenges of this legislation.  This will be an issue of concern.<\/p><p>Senator O'Brien brought the question of consumer awareness to the attention of the House on Second Stage.  He suggested a widespread programme of consumer education needs to be conducted and we do not disagree.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has stated that this would be hugely beneficial to the consumer in particular, and as the Senator has highlighted, because of the lack of awareness on the availability of credit information.  I agree it is very important that citizens are made aware of the register and its implications.  It is equally important for consumers to know that they have the ability to access a free copy of the credit report each year.  Consumer awareness and education is imperative if the legislation is to have a positive effect.  The Central Bank will carry out a public awareness campaign which will highlight the opportunities for individuals to avail of a free copy of their credit report each year. <\/p> <p>This important amendment was notified between Committee and Report Stages in the Lower House by Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty on behalf of the two main Opposition parties.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, was happy to amend the Bill on Report Stage so as to ensure it was clear that people were entitled to this information from the register free of charge, available on an annualised basis.  The Central Bank made the point that, in making people aware of this provision, a large consumer awareness campaign must be run.  We understand that the National Consumer Agency, NCA, will work with the Central Bank on the campaign's development so that the public can be aware of where the information is held and how to obtain it.  I presume that most information will be obtained electronically, but that is a matter for the bank to work out in due course.  I hope that I have answered the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700010#K01000","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387280100,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387280100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 1.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013: Committee Stage","time":1387280400,"counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700012#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1387280400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700012#N00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387280400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387280400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387280400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387280400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The theme of our debate on this issue was continued in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> summary yesterday on the McLoughlin report which urged health care insurers to query bills.  The Minister has said this so many times.  This is a sector in respect of which premiums have increased rapidly.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated here last week that premiums had increased by 86% over a four-year period.  The Minister proposes to go in the opposite direction and provide universal health insurance.  Are we in this regard applying for a further derogation from the European Court decision?  The Minister will be aware that there was a substantial difference of opinion at the beginning of this year between the Department and the VHI in regard to risk equalisation, as reported on 18 February last in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  The issue of whether the VHI would receive a capital injection and whether we could satisfy the competition requirements of Europe by the end of this year were to be addressed.  Reports published in the past few weeks indicate that a further derogation is being sought.  It would be a pity if that were the case.<\/p><p>  The Minister is correct in what he is doing to tackle the problem which he inherited.  The insurance companies should have been told ten years ago to tackle the cost base.  The cost of health insurance in Ireland should not be, as stated in the Milliman report, based on unnecessary admissions.  According to that report, average lengths of stay here are substantially in excess of international averages.  I know the Minister shares the concerns expressed by Senator Colm Burke in relation to the high cost of drugs in Ireland.  Is the whole system wrong in economic terms and are we now trying to correct it?  What will happen to the tax reliefs referred to in section 2?  The Minister for Finance gave a strong indication that as the cost of providing tax relief in this area has escalated to &euro;500 million and is now heading towards &euro;1 billion, it will be necessary to put in place a cap in this regard.  <\/p><p>  We need to move to a situation whereby competing health insurers are in a position to offer lower premiums because having implemented the recommendations of the Milliman report, the Minister's advice and what was recommended in the McLoughlin report, there are no longer unnecessary admissions or lengthy stays in hospitals and they have moved to the DRG system described by the Minister.  During the Second Stage debate I asked the Minister if there was scope for the Health Information and Quality Authority to set policy in regard to the length of time in respect of treatments and whether expensive hospital admissions are required, thereby eventually moving as many as possible of such treatments to the general practitioner system.  We have discussed in other forums the deskilling of GPs near hospitals because it is easier for them to refer patients on to consultants rather than treat them.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister's proposal to move from an unsatisfactory inherited model to a new model.  We were supposed to have a competitive health insurance market in 1994 but it still remains distorted and prices remain high.  I appreciate the Minister's concerns in that regard.  In <i>The Irish Times<\/i> article mentioned earlier, Mr. John McManus stated:  &quot;Reilly's optimism on VHI at variance with the facts.&quot;  I appreciate that the Minister has tried to tackle this problem, particularly in the past year.  I welcome his decision to have further reviews of the VHI undertaken by the Milliman and Mr. McLoughlin groups.  It is important we confront the cost problem in this sector.  I suppose that is what the troika is saying in the background.  I appreciate the difficulties and problems this creates for the Minister, including the revelations of recent times in regard to voluntary organisations topping up pay and increasing their cost base.<\/p><p>  As stated in the Milliman report the obsession of the incumbent and previous monopoly insurance company with its older client numbers has diverted its attention from a least cost approach.  Milliman referred in the report to his being unable to find much interest in cost effectiveness but a great deal of data on older people.  Last week, I asked the Minister the reason we do not have open enrolment, which means no patient is required to state his or her age.  The insurer would then be admitting people.  To make the risk equalisation payments we have to know people's age.  This encourages the high cost model we are dealing with today.  Could the issue regarding older people be tackled in any other way?  For example, could the VHI when it reaches a particular quota, refer people to one of the competing firms?  Could lists of older people be supplied to competing firms?  I accept the Minister's point that while we have open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover, by skilful marketing the new entrants have only 6% of old people even though their market share is substantially in excess of that.  <\/p><p>  Normally in a market an attempt is made to ensure that people swap and shift.  They do this in response to a price saving or they can decide to stay.  In subsidising them to stay we will never get the type of shift required either in the cost curve which the Minister desires or in market share.  The health insurance ombudsman could deal with people who have been refused cover by the new entrants.  We need, particularly in the environment about which the Minister spoke last week, to move to a situation whereby old and young people can gain by shopping around for alternative suppliers of health insurance.<\/p><p>  The protection given to VHI, which the European Court and Central Bank have criticised, and I gather, if newspaper reports are true, is to continue for another year is obstructing what we are trying to do.  There has been a tradition in the Department of trying to protect the VHI, using old people as the excuse for doing so.  If we were concerned about the insuring of old people and their refusal of cover we could have accomplished that goal in other ways.  We have ended up with a system that is now losing members, has a large increase in costs and is diverting the Minister and us away from the goal of universal health insurance.  <\/p><p>  In opposing this section I am seeking a change in the definition of &quot;net premium&quot; to take account of full costs rather than the cost when taxes have been written down.  We need to get to a situation whereby insurance companies in competing with each other act on behalf of the consumer and the wider society by negotiating much better deals from health service providers.  <\/p> <p>I assure the Minister of any support we can give him from these benches in achieving his goal.  The cost base of hospitals and the health service in Ireland needs to be tackled and the Minister does not face a very popular task in doing so.  However, it is necessary because otherwise this situation would have got out of control as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said here last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700012#N00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387281000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I remind Members that we are on Committee Stage and we should try to avoid Second Stage-type speeches and try to be precise to the amendment or section being discussed.

In the past five years more than &euro;3 billion has been taken from the health budget.  When people talk about cost, they seem to assume that cutting funding from health care also means cutting services, but that is not the case.  It is about making it more cost effective.  We have saved money as a result of being proactive in getting value for money and we need to go down that line.  The private health care sector must also become cost effective and I am not sure if that message has been taken on board by the private health care sector, particularly as it relates to health insurers which are paying out for private health care.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett spoke about cost competitiveness and the provision of medical insurance for older people.  There is no proactive effort by the VHI's competitors to go after that market, which is why we have had to introduce amending legislation to bring balance regarding those competitors which are going after a longer-term market and targeting the younger age group.  If the other three companies are interested in the older age group, we certainly have not seen any evidence of it and I do not believe we will see any such evidence in the immediate future.  It is unfortunate that the insurance companies are not making enough effort to reduce costs in the private sector.  That is how cost effectiveness from an insurance point of view can be introduced and we need to be more proactive in that regard.<\/p><p>The Bill deals with a number of issues in order to ensure fairness in the market when it comes to the cost of insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700013#O00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1387281000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I am reflecting on Senator Barrett's comments and I agree with him that the costs have been a problem.  The VHI having a large cohort of older clients and therefore greater cost has become a bit of a focus to the neglect of many other areas where it can control and needs to address costs.  That is very much my focus and I am pushing it down that road.  It has a new cost containment committee and it reports to me that it will have new very aggressive methods of dealing with its existing high costs.  I will not reiterate what I said previously.<\/p><p>I am concerned that the average length of stay has risen in the private sector while it is falling in the public sector and the cost of claims is increasing despite fewer people being insured.  Regarding many of the Senator's other suggestions, risk equalisation addresses the issue.  It is very clear that it is a subsidy to older customers by younger customers and to less well customers by customers in better health.  However, the key point is that it is a subsidy to any insurer which cares to insure older people.  As Senator Colm Burke pointed out, the problem is that they are not doing that.  So we will continue with the risk-equalisation scheme in order to address that.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for his amendment.  However, clearly my priority is the implementation of a robust equalisation scheme while minimising the impact on insurers' ability to carry out their business.  The legislation contains consumer protection measures providing that notification of a variation to product benefits already on the market may only be made once a year and subject to 30 days' prior notice to the Health Insurance Authority.  The Bill makes provision to extend the applicable date by which any changes to existing product must be notified to two months from 1 January 2014 to 1 March 2014.  It means that changes that alter the product categorisation from non-advance to advance may only take effect from 1 March 2014 and any subsequent year.  Any changes that alter the product categorisation from advance to non-advance can only take effect from 1 March 2014, thus in keeping with section 7 where the effective day for revised rates of risk equalisation credit is amended to 1 March 2014.<\/p><p>While I have no doubt that the Senator's intention is to protect the consumer, the result of his proposed amendment would be to create a window of opportunity where registered undertakings could increase the benefits or reduce the price to target individuals and thus further segment the market.  Therefore, I regret I must reject the proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700013#O00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1387281000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The pyrite resolution board may seek to recover damages or costs from any person responsible for pyritic damage to the dwelling of the applicant on foot of any arrangements agreed between the board and the applicant with regard to the institution of civil proceedings.

Our amendment proposes that homeowners who have already undertaken remedial works in the six years preceding this scheme from its commencement shall be eligible to apply to the scheme for compensation.  I moved a Bill early last year seeking to amend the Statute of Limitations.  I have met people who have spent significant moneys on their houses because they did not see any movement from this or the previous Government.  Effectively, they are being penalised for having carried out the work.  Many have borrowed and managed to remortgage their houses and get additional loans to carry out works to their homes at significant cost.  While people welcome the moves here today they feel aggrieved.  The works they have carried out the work, in many instances, were in the interests of safety.  My amendment seeks that those individuals would be eligible to apply to the board and the applications could be assessed on a case by case basis.  The cost of completing the pyrite test to assess the level of pyrite can be up to &euro;6,000.  The works on an average house can range between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000, and sometimes more, depending on the damage inside the house to fixtures and fittings.  I think this is a reasonable proposition. While I recognise the Minister does not have an endless pit of money and he wants to deal with those houses that are in immediate need of remedial works, we must remember a significant number of houses and apartments have been remediated at a cost to the homeowners, which they can verify.  We believe they should be eligible to apply to the scheme for compensation.  We believe that if we are to proceed in a fair manner these individuals should be eligible to apply, perhaps after the most badly affected dwellings are remediated.  Perhaps the Minister could give an indication in respect of VAT rebates and that individuals could write-off the cost against future tax liabilities that would not directly impact on the scheme.  In this instance, those people are being left high and dry.   I am interested to hear the Minister's views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700020#Y00900","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1387284600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I second the comments made by Senator Darragh O'Brien.  I have received many representations from individuals who had to carry out the work before the scheme was put in place.  It was not necessarily that they could afford to undertake this work but some found themselves in a situation where they had no choice, given that the houses were so badly damaged.  I received representations from young couples who remortgaged their properties and took out loans to do this work and from elderly people who dipped into their life savings to do it.  This was not easy.  Many ended up in further hardship as a result but they had to do the work because they could not wait and they were not sure when, or if, a scheme would be put in place.  When I raised this issue with the Minister on an Adjournment debate after the fund was announced, he said that in such circumstances people should go after their developers.  As the Minister is aware, unfortunately for many of those involved, the developers have since gone out of business so they are not able to recover it and even for those who had been fortunate to get money from developers' insurance funds, in many cases they would not refund the cost of the pyrite test which is &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000.<\/p><p>While I welcome the scheme and commend the Minister for bringing it forward - it will be positive for those who can benefit from it - it is unfair to exclude those who have already had to pay out this money, which they could not afford, and have had to take on additional liabilities in order to get the work done.  That they should be affected by a crude cut-off date is unfair.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to look at it again and as Senator Darragh O'Brien said, if necessary, find a creative way around the scheme to make it fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700020#Y01000","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1387284600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I understand where Senators are coming from in respect of this scheme.

I do not want to give a false impression that there will be a fall-back position of VAT refunds or compensation for people who have had works carried out.  I do not want to create that impression.

Obviously, his core concern was the loss of water services and the ability of that particular local authority to respond to severe weather situations in the future.  He is on record as saying that operational risks to the city council are very real because of the passage of this Bill.  Many of the issues and concerns he raised are very similar to those raised by a number of Senators raised over the past number of days in the lengthy debates we had.  Many of these issues related to the transfer of assets, properties and liabilities from local authorities to Irish Water.  One of the concerns expressed by the Dublin City Manager was that while &euro;2 billion euro worth of assets were being transferred, the &euro;330 million worth of pension liabilities will stay with the local authority.

It is very important that there is transparency in Irish Water.

I understand that the Dublin City Manager said the Minister or his Department refused to come.  As I understand it, he was advised that the date of the meeting was one where we would be here in the Seanad.  Certainly, I and my officials were unable to attend because we had to be here but we have no problem meeting with and listening to him.  That is not an issue.<\/p><p>I will read from the note I have here.  It may not necessarily be in the order in which the issues were raised but I think they are answered properly.  The local authorities operate a public sector defined benefit pay-as-you-go pension scheme.  For most of its staff, under the local government superannuation scheme, new entrants go on to the new single public service pension scheme.  Therefore, as pension liabilities fall due at the point of retirement, payments are made from annual current expenditure and contributions made by staff averaging about 6%.  The staff that currently work in water services in local authorities obviously already have pension entitlements.  These are a future liability on the authorities as things stand.  However, the Water Services Bill provides a mechanism for the payment to Irish Water by the Minister with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of pension benefits to local authority staff who transfer to Irish Water either now or following the termination of a service level agreement.  The service level agreement also provides for the payment by Irish Water of pensions to existing water services pensioners.  The only issues arise in the event that a service level agreement comes to an end and the local authority staff working under the agreement do not transfer to Irish Water.  In these cases, the liability would rest with the local authority.  I stress the next point - the Department has given a commitment to the County and City Managers' Association to keep this under review.  <\/p> <p>It has given a commitment that individual authorities who do not have the capacity to meet those liabilities will be addressed by an appropriate State subvention.  In any case, this will not materialise until the termination of the first service level agreement in 2025.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for the transfer of water service assets to Irish Water.  It also provides for the transfer of any loans and liabilities associated with those assets.  Since 2009, the Exchequer has provided funding of more than &euro;225 million to Dublin City Council for investment in water services infrastructure in the Dublin region.  The Senator commented on the cost of water being higher in Dublin than elsewhere.  The Bill provides for the 2013 non-domestic charges in individual local authorities to continue to apply from 1 January 2014 and, as has been agreed by Irish Water and the City and County Managers' Association, to continue to be collected by the local authorities on behalf of Irish Water for the first half of 2014, at which stage Irish Water will assume responsibility for collection.  <\/p><p>As we have discussed, the Commission for Energy Regulation will approve the new charges to be levied by Irish Water.  It is intended that standardised national charges will be in place for domestic consumers when charges commence from quarter four of 2014.  I will include provisions for the Government commitment on the free allowance and any other measures to deal with affordable charges which the Government may decide are necessary.<\/p><p>It is intended that the CER will phase in the consolidation of the non-domestic charges currently being charged by the 34 county and city councils.  There will not be an immediate change and they will continue to pay the same next year.  The phasing in of charges is the fairest approach as some customers will pay reduced rates while others will pay more.  It would not be desirable to upset viable businesses.  The Government is very conscious of this issue.<\/p><p>The Bill also provides that the CER must perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water.  Dublin City Council has not seen the final draft of the service level agreement which will be required.  The County and City Managers' Association, of which Dublin City Council is a member, has negotiated the text of the draft service level agreement with Irish Water.  <\/p><p>Dublin City Council's legal advice is that the Bill does not prohibit the sale of Irish Water or its assets.  The Bill has now been amended by Government amendment No. 78, which was introduced last night, to ensure that neither the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government nor the Minister for Finance can alienate the shares issues to them.  The 2013 Act already provides that Bord G&aacute;is Energy cannot alienate its share.  The Water Services Act 2007 which will apply to Irish Water once the Bill is enacted, already precludes the transfer of water service assets by Irish Water.<\/p><p>I hope I have clarified the issue for Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700024#EE02700","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387287300,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to speak on the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700025#FF00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1387287300,"counter":388,"content":"<p>The amendment states that the funds will transfer, with a full and comprehensive table of all moneys transferred.

A total of &euro;11 billion of assets will be transferred and I am assured by Irish Water that this information will be available on its website.

It seeks to remove completely the definition in this part of the Bill that deals with an approved water charges plan.  Essentially, this is Sinn F&eacute;in's way of opposing water charges and their introduction again.  There have been lengthy debates on this issue and Members were reminded this morning by the Leader that approximately 16 hours were spent discussing the Water Services (No. 2) Bill.  However,16 hours later they still do not know how much water charges will cost householders.  I genuinely believe that were the Minister of State, the Government parties and the Labour Party representatives in opposition, were this Bill being brought forward by the previous Government and were they asked to sign up to a Bill that includes water charges without knowing how those charges would be calculated or what they would mean for households, I have no doubt but that they would oppose the Bill on the same grounds as does Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p><p>  It is simply not a good way in which to deal with legislation.  In some respects, it is akin to a car salesman asking people to buy a car by telling them it looks great, has low mileage and will come with a free service - in that the first leak will be repaired - but the prospective purchaser cannot be told how much the car will cost.  As I do not believe anyone would buy a car if they had no idea how much it would cost, why should Members support the Bill if they have no idea how much it will cost people?  Members could be here for another 16 hours or even 60 days and the Minister of State still would not tell them how much it will cost householders.  Either he is not in a position to tell Members or he simply does not know.  Moreover, it is unacceptable that the Minister of State would pass the buck and the responsibility for the setting of water charges to the commission.  This will create problems in the future and to stick with the car sales analogy, this comes straight from the Arthur Daley school of economics by not telling Members how this will affect people.  It is completely unacceptable and I note similar discussions and debates were held when the household charge first was introduced.  I recall the Minister of State was sitting in the same chair when Members spoke of the likely degree of opposition among members of the public to the household charge.  At the time it was only &euro;100 and Members made the point that once the charge was introduced, it would increase substantially.  For the vast majority of households, it is now &euro;300 and it will increase further, as local authorities will be able to increase the charge by a certain percentage - I believe by 15% - after 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700029#LL01900","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387289100,"counter":440,"content":"<p>It can also be reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700029#LL02000","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1387289100,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Yes, but we all live in the real world, where local authority budgets are being cut.  While I would support a cut, it is again unfair to put responsibility back on local government while the Government is cutting funding to it.  However, the point is that it was &euro;100 at the outset but very quickly became &euro;300.  This is the real fear people will have in respect of water charges.  I have no doubt whatsoever that for the first couple of years, the full cost of water services will not be passed on to customers.  The Minister of State will undoubtedly be seeking an easy lead-in and again, it might be a low figure, people will be given a generous free allowance and there will be continued central Government subvention into Irish Water.  While people might start off on a low rate, their experience of stealth charges is that such charges are introduced on a low rate and then increase continually thereafter.  This simply is not good governance or good politics.  It is not good for Members to be asked to support a Bill, which at its heart and core pertains to the introduction of water charges, without having a clue as to what level of income the Government seeks to generate in the first instance from the charge and thereafter, how that charge will be calculated.  In this context, Members had a lengthy discussion on the issue of ability to pay and whether income will be taken into account but they simply do not know and are clueless in this regard.  This is not because of a lack of debate on this issue but because the Minister of State is not in a position, with respect, to give Members the answers to these questions.  I do not believe this to be acceptable and for this reason, I will oppose the section by supporting the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700029#LL02100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387289700,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  The definition of approved water charges plan is somewhat of a misnomer when we can see that it is very much a tax on water and on households.  In the debate yesterday on the way this charge will be implemented it was stated that this was a regressive tax that does not take into account a family's ability to pay, that grant aid will not be available to people who want to do remedial work and that it will be left to them to put stones in their cisterns, as the Minister mentioned yesterday, to try to reduce the amount of water they are using.  This must be seen for what it is, namely, an extra tax on people who are already stretched and this is our way of saying we are unhappy about this plan being introduced in this manner.  It has not been thought through.  It will not conserve water.  The necessary investment in dealing with the leakages will not be put in place, and we will not put in place the remedial measures such as rain water harvesting etc.  We have no option, therefore, but to oppose this part of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700030#MM00100","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387289700,"counter":443,"content":"<p>The issue here is not about charges; it is already agreed in principle that they will happen.  The issue is about a sustainable level of investment in our water infrastructure and how we can modernise our country's Victorian system of water services in terms of some parts of the pipe network, the unaccounted for water, and the inability of local authorities throughout the country to get new synergies to cut their costs by having a regional or even a national approach to all these issues.  It is about making Ireland attractive for inward investment and ensuring that companies like Intel will come to Ireland and invest here.  It is about making sure that the water supply in cities like Cork, Waterford and elsewhere is improved.  It is about stopping the era of contamination in the Senator's county, which experienced cryptosporidium problems that resulted in people in Galway being unable to drink the water from their taps for six months of the year.  It is about getting rid of the problems in areas that currently have boil notices.  It is about putting a structure in place that is dealt with by one body and done efficiently, effectively and properly.  The Senator's arguments, notwithstanding that he continues to make them, are not tangible in terms of improving our economy or ensuring Ireland's future through inward investment in water intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, food and so on.  This is a country in which such companies will invest because we will have the infrastructure to meet their needs.<\/p><p>Dublin has a significant problem in terms of water.  Nobody knows that better than the current county manager of Dublin, who is quoted in the newspapers today, and the former county manager of Dublin who just happens to be the chief executive of Irish Water.  They know exactly the problems.  They are involved in all the discussions.  I make the point strongly that it is not as if the managers do not know what is going on.  The facts are that the consultative group does not have one manager on it; it has two.  The City and County Managers Association is involved in every aspect of these changes and proposals and anybody who believes otherwise is not living in the real world.<\/p><p>The question the Senator raises is not the real question.  We must have the proper system in place, and that is what we intend to do.  I have the vision and the commitment to bring about that change, notwithstanding the difficulties.  The Senator asked why I cannot tell him what will be the charges.  I can tell him the way the figures will be computed, that they will be discussed in a transparent manner and put out for public debate.  The Oireachtas must have a debate on that.  I can tell him that the water services plan must and will be discussed by each local authority.  This is being done in a democratic fashion.  There is total transparency and accountability about everything we are doing here and as I pointed out yesterday and reiterate now, Members of the Oireachtas, be they in government, in opposition or Independents, have an important role because they can bring everybody before the committees to account, starting with me, the Minister, the officials of the Department, the Regulator, and the representatives of Irish Water.  That is where we will see that accountability and transparency.  The Senator has a right and a duty to bring people before those committees and to ensure he is satisfied, before a bill is sent to anybody's house, that he has full knowledge in terms of every aspect of his concerns.<\/p><p>What we are doing here is creating the framework for calculating the charge.  Currently, there are 34 separate systems for calculating, billing and collecting water charges.  I stand corrected if I am wrong but in Wicklow it is &euro;3.50 per metre cubed compared to half that in Kildare.  There are different charges for water in different local authorities across the country.  We have to address that problem and ensure there is one charge for domestic consumers and that there is a converging of charges for commercial consumers over a period of years.  That is what the Commissioner for Energy Regulation will be doing.<\/p><p>Work is under way on consolidating the financial and charging structures that will feed into the development of the first water charges planned by Irish Water.  Part of that process is examining what the plans will be, what will be done in the first and second phases, the outstanding liabilities and commitments, what the Environmental Protection Agency wants, what needs to be improved, the health and safety issues, what the consumer can bear, and what the company can raise privately.  All of those issues have to be considered before a figure is decided upon.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to continuing to invest in the infrastructure.  There will be a free allowance for every household.  There will also be affordability measures for people who have a need for-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700030#MM00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1387289700,"counter":444,"content":"<p>The Minister is broadening the scope of the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700030#MM00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1387289700,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I appreciate that but I am trying to make the point that it will be comprehensive, and all those costs will be included together.

We have seen a cut every year for the past number of years in water services in this State.  There has not been any substantial level of investment.  I do not see how any of that will amount to new investment in water services.<\/p><p>The Minister also spoke about a modern and more efficient system of water services yet the city manager of Dublin has said it could damage the council's ability to respond to severe weather events and was likely to cause very significant financial and operational risks to the city council.  Those are his words, not mine.  I am merely repeating for the Minister what one of the senior civil servants and the city manager of Dublin city said.  How can the Minister square his view that he is creating a modern system of water provision in this State that will be better for users, and that it is about conservation, when he was dismissive yesterday of many of the arguments we put forward on grant aid for some people?  I used the word &quot;arrogant&quot; yesterday in my contribution, which I withdraw.  It was said in the heat of the debate, which I regret, but I believe the Minister was dismissive of the genuine arguments we were putting forward on making grant aid available to people to ensure they can properly conserve water.  If the Minister was genuinely interested in conservation he would agree to such measures.  When he dismissed those arguments and did not accept those amendments, that tells me this is not about conservation but simply about raising revenue.<\/p><p>The Minister also spoke about unaccounted for water.  The only way we can deal with unaccounted for water is if we upgrade the system and have significant capital investment in it.<\/p> <p>Rather than putting a till on the taps of householders or cash registers outside their doors and spending money on water meters, it would have been much better had the Government used that money to fix the system, which is the point of this amendment.<\/p><p>The Minister of State discussed how water charges would improve the economy.  How in God's name can another regressive tax and bill for householders that will disproportionately impact on low income families do that?  Let there be no doubt, the very wealthy will be able to invest in all of the technologies we discussed yesterday and will have smaller water bills to pay than low income families who will not be in a position to do likewise.

This is where we should make those decisions.  Before we sign up to a Bill that allows for water charges, we should have a clear idea about how they will be calculated.  We do not know how.

I will try to clarify it again.  The legislation is like a framework for what will happen.  Addressing the questions of how Irish Water will operate, what it will do in people's counties and how the regulator will make its decision and compute costs - the regulator is on record as saying it wants to engage proactively - is the role of an Oireachtas committee.  Committees are made for these types of investigation, analysis, transparency and accountability.  They will do the work and make the recommendations.  Obviously, the Senator has an important role in challenging each recommendation.<\/p><p>The problem with improving the water supply is that a significant amount of the unaccounted for water is on the customer's side, for example, inside the garden fence.  Metering will identify those leakages and reduce them by at least 15% overall.  It is not regressive that people should pay for their water.  It is right, proper and fair that the more one uses, the more one pays.  People who are sick or on low incomes must be addressed through affordability measures.  Everyone will have a basic allowance.  There are incentives to reduce water usage and capital costs in that, if water is saved, the same amount of capital will not be necessary for treatment and pumping.  I am confident that important new synergies will be created as a result of Uisce &Eacute;ireann's establishment.<\/p><p>The Senator should not lose sight of one thing, that up to 1,700 people will be employed during the metering process.  These will be real jobs for real people.  They will be sustainable and important for a short period.

I ask him to intervene to ensure that urgent remedial works can proceed for Seanadh Ph&eacute;ist&iacute;n Bridge in Connemara.  This bridge is located between Rossaveal and Oughterard.  I am sure the Minister knows the area well.  Some 17 families are affected in that they are cut off from normal life, so to speak, and are severely disadvantaged as a result.<\/p><p>I ask the Department to work out a solution to this problem.  At the root of the problem is a European directive, which is being tested on Seanadh Ph&eacute;ist&iacute;n Bridge.  A limit of 1.5 tonnes was put on the bridge and as a result certain vehicles such as an ambulance, a fire service vehicle, the special needs minibus and a specially modified car for a disabled child cannot cross it.<\/p> <p>Since the limit of 1.5 tonnes was put on this bridge certain vehicles, such as the ambulance, the fire brigade, the minibus for those with special needs, or a car modified for a disabled child, cannot cross it.  This came to a head when a woman with a child who has cerebral palsy was found crying at the bridge because she could not cross it and bring her child for essential therapies.  The child needs 24-hour care.  This directive has the potential to cause a national transport failure because it applies to every bridge in the country but this is the first to be affected. <\/p><p>The nearest emergency ambulance, normally 9 miles away when the bridge is structurally sound, can no longer use this bridge and must travel an alternative 100 km route to get there.  So much for response times.  The alternative route is hazardous, very prone to frost in winter and at times impassable, which means it cannot be relied on in emergencies.  A total of 17 families are stranded.  One family, as I said, has a daughter with special needs who requires 24-hour care and travels in a modified vehicle which cannot cross the bridge as it exceeds the weight restriction.  Oil supplies, animal feeds and goods can no longer cross because of their weight.  It costs much more to buy them because of the bridge failure.  Pensioners and families in need face unnecessary hardship, having to pay more to get fewer essential provisions.  Some families cannot afford the extra costs and I am told they are freezing and starving as a result.<\/p><p>The core issue is that a judgment of the European Court of Justice, C-215\/06, regarding the environmental impact assessment directives pertaining to roads and bridges under the current Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 prevents the work being easily done on this.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and Galway County Council are dying to do the work.  They even have the money but they need, as I see it, an amendment to the law.  How can this be quickly remedied?  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to intervene fairly quickly.  The correspondence on this issue dates back to 2010.  The substitute consent process under sections 74, 75, and 261A was intended for quarries but is now being applied to bridges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700032#OO00500","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387291200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>The Senator has eaten into Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121700033#PP00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1387291200,"counter":469,"content":"<p>This is urgent.
