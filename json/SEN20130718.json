Earlier this week the British House of Commons published a report on the horsemeat scandal, which is still very much alive despite the lack of media coverage.  It is alive in the context of a lack of prosecutions.  The report was critical of both UK and Irish Governments for what it described as lack of action in exposing fraudulent activities in the meat industry.  One member of the committee, Margaret Ritchie, MP, of the SDLP, went further, stating that within the committee criticism had been expressed about Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Irish interests were well-defended in that it was Ireland that initially exposed this scandal but according to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who was on the media earlier this week, there is one prosecution pending.  That is not enough.  I would hate to think that people within the industry who acted fraudulently will get away with this just because the matter seemingly has been resolved.  Restrictive procedures have been put in place to ensure this does not happen again.  In that context, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is currently before the agriculture committee discussing the recent CAP reform decisions.  The Leader might consider inviting the Minister to the House in the new session.  It would be an opportunity also for him to expand on the horsemeat scandal in the context of the questions I have raised.<\/p><p>I was one of the members present at the transport committee meeting yesterday, and it has been widely reported in today's media, who raised the issue of the lack of sufficient funding for the maintenance of our primary national road network as distinct from our local and regional road network.  On the previous occasion I raised that with Fred Barry, the chief executive officer, he indicated some concern in the National Roads Authority about the lack of adequate funding to ensure that the road maintenance programme would be maintained.  The amounts we are talking about are running to billions of euro.  I appreciate fully that the Government and the economy does not have that sort of resource but it seems to me, and I have made this point previously, that that it is &quot;short-termism&quot;.  A way should be found to come up with a sufficient amount of money, whether from the European Investment Bank or under the proposal now emanating from Government, to use some of the &euro;1 billion promissory note savings on capital programmes because we must maintain our national road network, which is a vital artery in terms of our entire economic activity, to the required standards.  That the funding has been cut from &euro;600 million last year to &euro;300 million when &euro;1.2 billion is needed gives some indication of the scale of the problem.  It would be worthwhile if the Leader invited the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to the House in the new session to outline the Government's thinking on this because it will be coming at a time when the Budget Estimates are more or less confirmed and it might give some succour, not only to private motorists but to the commercial life of this country, that our road network would not continue to crumble in the manner in which it now appears to have done, as outlined by some engineers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800002#A00500","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374139800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Burton, of the Bill for gender recognition, which will finally provide a way in which transgender persons can achieve recognition of their gender.  This Bill has been a long time coming.  There was a very detailed consultation process, and I very much look forward to having a debate on it in this House, but we need to move on also with seeking to legalise marriage for same-sex couples because without that it is difficult to see how the new gender recognition legislation will apply to persons who are already married.  That has been a real obstacle in trying to achieve the final drafting of that Bill.  In a way that issue has been left unresolved pending the referendum on marriage equality that we all hope will happen next year.<\/p><p>  I also welcome the publication this week of the new Bill on assisted decision-making and capacity to replace a very outdated wards of court system dating back to 1871.  We have had extensive hearings on that in the justice committee on the previous heads of a Bill.  Again, it has been a long time coming and I am glad to see it has been published.  I hope we will debate it early in the autumn.<\/p><p>  I call on the Leader for a debate, as other Members have done, on the Magdalen institutions but in particular on ways in which religious orders might be compelled legally to provide contributions to the redress fund.  The Taoiseach and others have said rightly that there does not appear to be any way legally to compel them but a creative debate on ways in which compulsion could be brought to bear would be very useful.  Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i> reports that the assets of the four religious orders that ran the Magdalen laundries, and profited for many years from the slave labour of the women incarcerated there, on the last occasion they were valued, were worth &euro;1.5 billion.  It is clear there are assets available and it seems extraordinary that there is no legal way for the State to compel some sort of recovery from those religious orders of the moneys that will be expended on the redress scheme, given the extent of those assets.<\/p><p>  I call for a debate in the autumn on the MABS service in light of the worrying delays reported in accessing MABS, particularly with the new insolvency legislation coming into place.  Increasing numbers of people will be looking for the services of MABS and it is a worry to hear there are real inconsistencies in the length of time people must wait for an appointment with MABS across the country.  Some of it may be to do with management in particular offices but if there is a resourcing issue we need to examine that.  I ask the Leader for a debate on that again early in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800003#B00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1374139800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I wish a happy 95th birthday to Nelson Mandela.

Professor John Luce stated: &quot;With all due respects, I now present to you our past century's most outstanding champion of human rights, His Excellency, Nelson Mandela.&quot;  The accolade to him concludes: <blockquote><br \/>You see before you a man of exceptional tenacity and outstanding magnanimity whom I think it is appropriate to salute in the old Roman fashion as the father of his country.  As he inscribes his name on our Roll of Honour, see to it that the thunder of your applause re-echoes through this hall.  <\/blockquote>His proposers were two great human rights advocates, one a former Member of this House, Senator Trevor West, and Professor Kader Asmal.  It is worth noting also that long before that the students named their headquarters in Trinity, when Nelson Mandela was in the Robben Island jail, as Nelson Mandela House.  It is a terrific occasion for us to celebrate one of the great people of recent times.<\/p><p>  I express my support for the Government again in dealing with banking.  I base that on the Which? survey of banking, which shows that the two worst banks are Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  Bank of Ireland has 41% approval while Ulster Bank has 45%.  We all realise the immense problems these people have created for the Government, and I assure the Government that any measures to reform these awful institutions will have support from this side of the House.<\/p><p>  Regarding Senator Mooney's comments about roads, the Leader may recall that when we discussed it with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, on a previous occasion he said he would come back with a measure to change the way in which heavy goods vehicles are taxed from the unladen weight of the vehicle to the laden weight per axle.  He was not against the idea in total but I am informed by civil engineers that these inappropriately taxed commercial vehicles account for the bulk of the damage done to roads.  The research is 40 or 50 years old.  It is time to change the basis on which we tax commercial vehicles to reflect the fact that in times of budget constraints we wish to reward vehicles that do not damage the highways, impose the appropriate levies on those that do and hope the fleet will gradually change to ones which do not crack the road surface.  A road tax system could be designed to reflect that.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, was not opposed to the idea.  He said he would examine it and in view of what was presented in the transport committee yesterday and Senator Paschal Mooney's comments, it is now time to reopen the file on that.  We might debate it in the new term or perhaps the Minister of State might consider it is worth doing without debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800003#B00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1374139800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am concerned, as I know all Members are, about the absence of MABS and the Irish League of Credit Unions from the Central Bank pilot debt scheme.

That is a worrying development.  The <i>Irish Independent<\/i> quoted a MABS spokesperson as saying they were booted out of the scheme because the MABS approach to debt resolution was not acceptable to certain members.  MABS had been proposing a more holistic approach to debt resolution and apparently this was not acceptable to some banks.  It now looks as if the Central Bank will seek to get a United Kingdom debt charity or a debt collection service to get involved in place of MABS.  That is a very worrying development because it means that the pilot process set up at the initiative of the banks now only comprises the Central Bank and the lenders.<\/p> <p>It is devoid of the involvement of those who are concerned about financial services from the perspective of the borrower and the wider general public.  The Irish League of Credit Unions opted out because its members regarded it as too one-sided against borrowers.  Now the banks have succeeded in getting MABS excluded because they do not like the proposals from MABS.  We need to become involved and to find out more about the situation.

I call on the Governor of the Central Bank and the heir apparent to Mr. Elderfield, Ms Fiona Muldoon, to show that the Central Bank is independent of the banks - which it is meant to be - and can resist their attempts to mould an initiative in a way which sets the lenders' agenda.

I recall the joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas which was addressed by Nelson Mandela.  I was a Member of the D&aacute;il at that time.  It was a great honour to welcome him to Ireland.  He also attended the Special Olympics in 2003.  The years he spent in Robben Island and his dedication to the ending of apartheid was an inspiration for people throughout the world and throughout America, where apartheid, in a sense, is still being exercised in many areas, as highlighted by the recent tragic death of a young black person.  Kadar Asmal was a lecturer in Trinity College and subsequently became Minister for Water in South Africa.  We should also recall today those heroic workers in Dunnes Stores who boycotted South African fruit in support of the anti-apartheid movement.

On a number of occasions I have called for a debate at which the Minister for Finance would be present in order to discuss the banking system.  I do not think that letters to say the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is none of his business are an adequate and sufficient response.  A debate on banking is critical in the context of where we want to go in September. A resolution of the mortgage crisis is one of the most pressing issues, as discussed over the past months, which will not go away over the summer and will be waiting for us in September.  The latest IBF figures on mortgage lending showed that lending is down by 20%, from 2,630 mortgages in the first quarter of last year to 2,068 mortgages in the first quarter of this year.  I am sick of seeing the advertisements everywhere from the various pillar banks stating that they are open for business and please come in because they are dying to lend money.  This statement is misleading and deceptive.  Unless we get the mortgage market operational again, there will be major difficulties.  <\/p><p>I support the comments of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland which suggests the Government should introduce a mortgage credit review body to ensure fairness and transparency in the mortgage market.

I understand that some orders have investment portfolios in hedge funds and elsewhere of hundreds of millions of euro.  It seems to me to be grossly unchristian not to make this available to people who have been mistreated and to lump the burden on taxpayers who are already very heavily overburdened.<\/p><p>I share the concerns expressed on the Government side about MABS.  It is a wonderful service but it is grossly overstretched and it has not been properly funded.  People looking for appointments are being told they will not be seen until Christmas.  The banks have now been unleashed upon them and with the passing of the Insolvency Bill they can make any number of harassing telephone calls.  I voted against that provision.  I am afraid this will lead to people taking their own lives.  <\/p><p>I welcome the Bill on gender recognition, but it has some very serious flaws.  For example, the plight of younger people going to school has not been sufficiently addressed.  More worrying, this is despite the evidence given to the Joint Committee on Health and Children by Dr. Crowley, the HSE national director for quality and patient safety, who said that the HSE endorses a gender recognition process which places the responsibility for self-declaration on the applicant rather than on the details of a medical certificate diagnosis.  In doing so, the emphasis is placed on the process of legal recognition of that self-declaration as opposed to the legal recognition of the medical certificate or diagnosis.  They are flying in the face of their own expert advice.<\/p><p>I campaigned on the divorce referendum.  Just as I said about abortion, I said that nobody is being forced to have a divorce, but the worrying aspect is that it seems they are.  This legislation provides that people who undergo gender reassignment - even if they are in a happy relationship from which the sexual element may have faded out, they may have children and want to stay together for the sake of the family - the State is now forcing them to divorce.  This is forced, involuntary divorce and it is utterly wrong.  It should be the decision of the two people involved.  Why should the State destroy that wish if they want to stay together as a family?  It is absurd.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800004#C00800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374140400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill on gender recognition and I acknowledge that some flaws exist, but the provision on age could be re-examined.

We need to reach out to people who are suffering.  Services are in place but information on these services should be available to those who are suffering.  Brendan Nix is also a senior counsel.

I was not at all persuaded by the Taoiseach's contribution in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The State has a responsibility to be much more insistent, to say the least, with the religious orders to force them to face up to their responsibilities.

I very much welcome the fact that the Construction Contracts Bill has been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and pay particular tribute to our colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, for his work on that Bill.  We have seen a drop of 200,000 people employed in the construction sector in recent years and badly need to rebuild trust in that sector, in particular for small contractors and small business people involved in it.  In complimenting Senator Feargal Quinn, I hope this will be the start of a gradual return to sustainable economic levels in the construction sector and that many of the Government-sponsored projects, in particular the building of schools and other infrastructural protects, will be of significant benefit to many of the small contractors who lost out significantly as a result of, and whose livelihood's were ruined by, ruthless operators.  Let us ensure this never happens again and that we get the construction sector back to sustainable levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800005#D00900","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1374141000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate when we come back in September on the future of rural Ireland.

There is probably a need to consider having a Minister for rural affairs.

That would be a retrograde step at a time when EirGrid is putting up pylons throughout the country.<\/p> <p>In rural Ireland, the infrastructure serves only to provide a conduit for energy for the bigger cities.  At the same time, we say there should be community gain where pylons and wind turbines are accepted.  If pylons are to crisscross the landscape, broadband should be provided on those pylons for rural Ireland.  There should be joined-up thinking on the part of the Minister and EirGrid to provide these things.  This warrants an extensive debate.  Anybody from rural Ireland knows that towns are dying on their feet.  It has been said repeatedly in the House.  It must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.

I hope the Minister will attend the House early when we return to discuss agriculture, during which debate the particular matter of the horsemeat issue can be discussed.  I note the Senator's question on the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which is discussing road maintenance.  I will seek to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, address the problem and provide the House with his opinions.<\/p><p>  Senators Bacik, Moran and Norris spoke about the publication of the Gender Recognition Bill, which I understand will be coming before the House in the autumn.

It was addressed with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Dowd, and I will ask him what the up-to-date position is.<\/p><p>  Senators Coghlan and Hayden referred to MABS withdrawing from the pilot scheme.  MABS has released a press release which states:<blockquote>MABS, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, was surprised at media reports of their withdrawal from the Central Bank initiative on support to distressed borrowers with multiple debts.  MABS was very pleased to submit a proposal to fulfil this role of Third Party Service Provider and to present\u00a0 a proposal\u00a0 to the panel of lenders, convened and facilitated by the Central Bank.  As indicated in its submission and elaborated on at the meeting with the panel, MABS felt that the initiative was an important one for borrowers and one which was attractive to MABS on the basis that it provided an opportunity to further expand on the work MABS currently does with all creditors, and in particular with IBF members, and to further develop relationships with credit unions.\u00a0 Further it is to the mutual benefit of all parties, and most importantly to the benefit of distressed borrowers.  MABS were willing to accept the associated terms and conditions as presented however, on further engagement with panel members, it became apparent that the proposed approach was not acceptable to certain lenders.  Based on its proven track record of delivering for both lenders and borrowers for over 20 years, MABS believes it could add value to this important initiative, delivering positive outcomes for borrower and lender alike.  MABS proposal, as originally outlined, still stands.<\/blockquote>I concur with Senators Coghlan and Hayden that we will have to have a very hard look at this situation if lenders and bankers are dictating things.  It will have to be addressed.  Senator Hayden also called for a debate on banking.  Certainly, I will ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to come to the House for a debate on that topic.  We have had a number of debates on banking, but I agree that we should continue to discuss the subject.<\/p><p>  Senator Keane referred to the opinion of the Limerick coroner on the recording of suicide in reports.  It is something we will raise with the Minister for Justice and Equality to see if it can happen.  I note Senator Moran's remarks on the offensive comments which were made by a Member in the House yesterday.<\/p><p>  Senator Mullins spoke about the Government's priority of job creation and called for an innovative budget to include measures which will help to create jobs, particularly in the construction sector.  I agree with him.  The measures which will be taken will assist.  While we are creating 2,000 jobs per month currently, it is very important that we provide jobs in the development of infrastructure, including schools, which would put people who were involved in the construction industry back to work.<\/p><p>  Finally, Senator Kelly called for a debate on rural Ireland, with particular reference to broadband.  I have asked the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, to come to the House and am waiting for a date to be nominated for him to attend to discuss that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800006#E00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1374141600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I asked the Leader if, for the benefit of all Members, he would give some indication of his thinking on how the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill will progress through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800006#E00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1374141600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I hope Committee Stage of the Bill will be concluded today.

I wish to speak on amendment No. 38, which seeks to insert: &quot;(<i>d<\/i>) where the unborn is sixteen weeks gestation or older, an effective anaesthetic for pain relief shall be administered to the foetus before the medical procedure is commenced.&#8221;  Truly, I regret that we even have to discuss this issue.  However, we know what we are legislating for.  We are legislating so terminations and abortions can take place, albeit in limited circumstances.  If we must do so, the very least we should do is ensure the procedure will be pain-free for the little baby, the unborn, the foetus.<\/p><p>  There is a lot of evidence to support the view that the unborn feels pain from 17 weeks onwards.  Neonatal surgeons in the United Kingdom use anaesthetics in surgery on unborn children as they conclude they feel pain.  A pro-choice professor, Professor Glover, called for anaesthetics to be used during abortions of unborn children from 17 to 24 weeks.  She said that a foetus aborted between 17 and 24 weeks after conception may feel pain.  To give her her due, she said she was pro-choice, which means supporting terminations and abortions, but she said that &quot;one should not muddle the two&quot;.  She stated, &#8220;One should think about how one is doing it in the most pain-free way.&#8221;  What can the Minister tell us about foetal pain during a termination or abortion?  Would he support me in saying that when a procedure must be carried out that will take the life of the unborn, it should happen in the most pain-free way possible?  I plead with him to accept my amendment to enure the presence of an anaesthetist at every termination and abortion to ensure the baby, the unborn, will not feel pain.<\/p><p>  According to Professor John Wyatt, consultant neonatal paediatrician at University College Hospital, London, and a member of the Commission of Inquiry into Human Fetal Sentience, anxiety is now stifling research.  He said &quot;no responsible scientist or clinician can publish work in this area without a certain degree of trepidation that it will be seized upon by spin doctors and propagandists from both sides of the abortion debate.&quot;  In other words, he is saying we should forget about the spin doctors and look at the evidence.  The evidence is that the foetus, the unborn, feels pain.  Let us ensure the procedure is done in as pain-free and dignified a way as possible.<\/p><p>  What is the Minister planning to approve in this jurisdiction?  Will he accept my amendment providing that an anaesthetist should be present at every termination and abortion?  It is the very least the Government could provide for.  What does the Minister know about foetal pain during termination?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800008#J00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374142500,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I will first address amendment No. 4.  I do not propose to accept it, as the main purpose of the Bill is to restate the general prohibition on abortion in Ireland in line with Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution while regulating access to lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with the X case and the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case.<\/p><p>  Section 22 sets out that it is an offence to destroy unborn human life intentionally.  However, in order to regulate access to lawful terminations of pregnancy, exemptions are made under the terms of Bill where there is a real and substantial risk to the woman's life.  I therefore do not propose to accept this amendment.<\/p><p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 37 and 38, which concern the issue of viability, the Bill makes reference to a medical practitioner's reasonable opinion, which places a statutory duty on each medical practitioner forming an opinion to have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  This imposes a clear duty on medical practitioners to make every effort to preserve the life of a foetus where possible.<\/p> <p>A failure to do so would place a practical practitioner in breach of the proposed legislation and subject to its penalties.<\/p><p>It is not the purpose of the Bill to regulate obstetric procedures which do not constitute termination of pregnancy or to dictate the practice of obstetrics.  Standard medical practice will provide appropriate mechanisms for assessment of both the woman and the unborn.  It would not be appropriate to include this or other details of medical treatment in legislation.  In other words, as we have said elsewhere, we cannot be prescriptive in terms of how members of the medical profession carry out their duty.  Best practice changes in line with guidelines from the respective educational facilities, institutes and college.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800008#J00600","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374142800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I do not support amendment No. 4 because it would reverse the entire intention of the Bill.  It is unrealistic because there are clearly circumstances where it is important and proper to end the life of a foetus in preference to the loss of life of the mother.  That might not be in line with the Constitution but, as I have already said, that was a mistaken amendment.  Everybody now knows it was a huge error.<\/p><p>I am much more in sympathy with the other proposals in this group.  However, in regard to amendment No. 37, in the name of Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, as I understand it, the provision contained therein is already the position in the legislation as it stands, namely, that when a foetus becomes viable, the effort will be made to preserve that life.  That is my understanding of the legislation as it exists.  I am sympathetic to the amendment, but it is redundant.<\/p><p>In regard to the first part of amendment No. 38, in the name of Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, I would make the same argument, that it is already covered.  The second part of the amendment states: &quot;where the unborn is sixteen weeks gestation or older, an effective anaesthetic for pain relief shall be administered to the foetus before the medical procedure is commenced&quot;.  If this is an effort to generate political momentum behind the notion that the foetus is a complete and separate individual, I do not agree with it.  However, if it can be demonstrated medically that the foetus is capable of experiencing pain, then of course it would be natural to administer an anaesthetic.  I have no problem with that and hope doctors would do it in any case.  I have no difficulty with either part of Senator Healy Eames's amendment, but the first is already covered and the second is presumably standard medical practice where it can be demonstrated that the foetus is capable of feeling pain.  However, I would not like it to be taken as an opportunity to push the notion that the unborn - that is a very unattractive description which reminds me of &quot;undead&quot;; I do not like it - is a separate individual.  Pain relief should certainly be administered where the foetus can demonstrably feel pain.  One would do the same for an animal.  In short, I have no real difficulty with this part of the amendment, with the proviso I have given, but if I have understood the Minister's response, it is not possible for the legislation to be prescriptive of medical practice to that level of detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800009#K00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374142800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>The Minister has been at pains over many months, as has the Taoiseach, to tell us that this Bill is about the protection of both mother and baby.

That is why I tabled amendment No. 4.  The medical procedures envisaged under this legislation are not defined in the definitions section, but they include the prescribing by a medical practitioner of any drug or medical treatment.  We all know what those procedures are in the context of abortion as it is understood globally.

The medical evidence we heard over the six days of hearings by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children clearly set out  current medical practice in dealing with situations where complications in pregnancy put the mother's life at risk.

These are very relevant issues, particularly for those of us who see the need for two lives to be protected at all times, as far as practicable.  For example, the issue arose previously regarding the display of images of aborted children and whether that is appropriate and sensitive.  I am aware that Senator Walsh - I do not criticise him for this - caused a degree of controversy with his very frank account of what abortion can involve.  That, perhaps, had the indirect, but desirable, effect of a discussion on radio, where people got to hear about some of the realities.  Life deserves to be protected, regardless of the means of its ending.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that in terms of mere discussion, the ending of an unborn child's life at an early stage of pregnancy is not as evocative or as disturbing as that of the late-term ending of the unborn child's life.  I have often felt that RTE is greatly to be criticised in this regard.  While I would not suggest or ever support the random display of disturbing images - I have always been against that - I have always felt that we should be able to display some images, in the same way as we are invited to contemplate the effect of famine, on occasions, with appropriate warnings to people that the images they may see are likely to be disturbing.  It seems strange and bizarre that as a public service broadcaster, RTE has never, over the years, introduced us to the reality of what abortion involves in clinics abroad, in Britain and America in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800010#L00600","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374143400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>We are dealing with the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800010#L00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374143400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>On a point of order, the Chair should be acting independently, not taking his lead from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800010#L00800","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374143400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I am acting independently.

We are actually trying to introduce a new sort of fantasy whereby, when an abortion happens, the stork comes along and somehow the baby disappears - that there is actually no procedure, no pain, no stress, no duress.  Let us not live in that fantasy land.  Let us face what is actually happening.  Let us deal with the inconvenient truth put on the record of this House by Senator Walsh two days ago, which appeared to cause huge distress.  We are talking about life and death.  We are talking about all the gory details of this procedure, and let us not pretend otherwise.  At least, however, as a so-called civilised society, let us try to put in place some type of pain alleviation.  I am not an expert in that field but many of the Minister's colleagues are.  In particular, I would be very interested in a response to the question raised by Senator Mullen as to whether the Department of Health has reflected upon this.  My understanding is that this amendment was not tabled in the other House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800011#M00700","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1374144000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>This is the first time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800011#M00800","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374144000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>This is a Seanad amendment, not a D&aacute;il amendment.

It is important that we do not try to create a uniformity in the debate itself.  I have always felt that heckling and interruptions in this House on any subject are not acceptable.  I am glad to say that in 16 years I have never done it.<\/p><p>In this particular case, in the early part of the abortion debate, I spent a lot of time reflecting.  I said very little, perhaps, except on Second Stage, but I always reflected on what exactly it meant to the unborn child to be aborted.  I started initially in the context of the status the unborn child has in our Constitution, but I also went further than that with regard to an issue that is being expanded on here today, that of foetal pain.  There is a temptation to avoid that discussion.  To some extent I can understand its avoidance out in the media, but I cannot understand our avoiding it here, in a House of Parliament, where each of us individually must respond to the knowledge we have accumulated and also to the values we hold.  If we do not do that, the feeling at the end of the day will be that we did not act as good legislators.<\/p> <p>I also reflected on what that abortion meant.  The contribution made in the Chamber by Senator Jim Walsh did not shock me at all.  We are in a House of Parliament.  It might have shocked me on the \"Late Late Show\" or \"Prime Time\", or if it had been used as propaganda methodology in a publication.  That is not where we are; we are in a House of Parliament.  Each piece of understanding we requested, whether from the Minister or from someone who holds a different view, is very important.  I accept the fundamental issue is that we are denying an innocent human being of the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential.  <\/p><p>The question of foetal pain is a very important one for us.  It is not a matter of changing other people's minds but of helping us to make up our own.  I know nobody in this House would deliberately inflict pain on another human being and I respect each person for that.  However, we may ignore some information if we do not endeavour to tease it out.  Very relevant questions were put to the Minister today; it is for that reason he is present.  The Department has the resources.  The questions put by Senator Mullen are very relevant.  What information does the Minister have in regard to that point?  What is the medical evidence?  Is that not why we are here today?  It would certainly help me to understand.  Obviously I am anti-abortion and would be an advocate for the unborn child but I would still like to know if there is pain involved in an abortion.  That is all we are discussing and we should be able to do so in a courteous, tolerant and understanding way in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800011#M01000","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374144600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Although I support this Bill, I believe Senators Healy Eames, Bradford, Mary Ann O'Brien and others have made a good point.

We are clarifying the legal situation for them concerning the service they are obliged to provide and what is legally permissible.  We are not telling them how to do that service or how to practise and I certainly do not believe we should.

I have no difficulty, being strongly pro-choice, but it seems to me that if the foetus is capable of experiencing pain of course one would give it an anaesthetic.  It is very interesting, and probably true as Senator O'Donnell noted, that if the mother is fully anaesthetised so is the child, the unborn, or whatever they call it nowadays.  That seems reasonable.  Could we have a clarification on that point?  I do not expect an absolute one because, as I understand it, the Minister has not practised as a gynaecologist.  I wonder if there is any knowledge that could be made available to the Seanad that would set at ease the minds of people such as me, who are reasonable and pro-choice.

The idea is that the only way of abating her suicidality is for the baby not to be born.  If we are not prescriptive, could a woman present late in the term, at 20 to 32 weeks, for example, with a pregnancy and get certification and entitlement to abortion?

Senator Norris and others may have picked up the point incorrectly but it is not my intention to impede or interfere with any case arising from sections 7 or 8.  The amendment will not do so.  The Minister is not accepting it as it would, in effect, any abortion taking place under section 9, as it involves the direct and intentional killing of the baby.<\/p><p>  With regard to foetal pain, at eight weeks - which is very early in pregnancy - a child can make tiny fists, get hiccups and whatever else.  That baby is evolving.  At 11 weeks, the placenta continues to supply food and oxygen, and the child has legs and can make complex facial expressions and even smile.  Current medical technology is able to prove this.  That is the first trimester.  At 16 weeks, the child can use hands to grasp, swim and turn somersaults.  At 18 weeks, still in the second trimester and at a time when the baby would be regarded as not viable by many, he or she is active and energetic and can flex muscles.  That is often the first indication to a mother as she can feel the baby in her womb.<\/p><p>  We are talking about a mother's life but the Minister has rightly indicated the need to protect the unborn as well.  Surely to goodness we can do that by building in as many safeguards as possible.

If anybody is disgusted with a description of what happens with an abortion, whether in this House, the medical profession, the Department, the HSE or elsewhere, they would be disgusted to a factor of 100 if they envisaged the procedure becoming a reality in practice.  As Senator Bradford rightly stated, it is an inconvenient truth.<\/p><p>  What procedures will be allowed if the Minister is not to be prescriptive in the Bill?

Legitimate issues have surfaced here.  I say in passing that if Senator O'Donnell is right in what she suggests - I think she asked it in a most helpful way and Senator Norris concurred with her - and if that disposes of the issue and we can be assured, that is fine but the Minister should not expect us to leave this issue alone when it has not even been ventilated in the D&aacute;il and when we are operating against the background of a constitutional protection of the unborn.  The Minister should not expect us to be neutral, blithe or uncaring about the question of whether an unborn child being aborted can feel pain and whether there ought to be a legislative duty on doctors and other medical personnel to ensure it does not happen.  I ask the Minister for a better response than he has given to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800014#P00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>It may be inconvenient for Senator Mullins but the truth is the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800014#P00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800014#P00600","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>My apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800014#P00700","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>It is a helpful interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800014#P00800","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>The fact of the matter is that what we are legislating for is to bring clarity to a process of a determination.  There is clarity around how the decision will be arrived at but not how the consequence of that decision should be carried out because that is to be prescriptive.  There is no running away from that and no amount of language will cloud that or change that.  That is why I will not be able to accept the amendment.  I accept the Senator may want to withdraw it so that she can resubmit it on Report Stage, and so be it.<\/p><p>However, I will not be in any way deceitful here.  I will be straight and clear.  Doctors will make their clinical judgment and they will act to ensure safe and as pain-free as possible care.  The Senator asked about the draft regulations and they will be on the Department's website this evening.<\/p><p>Senator Walsh talked about the viability of the baby.  I am making it absolutely clear that if a viable baby is born, everything will be done to support that baby.  A woman has a right in this country, as we speak and without this legislation, to a termination of pregnancy where it is the only treatment available to avert the real and substantial risk to her life.  As I said earlier in this House and in the other one, no woman, no man, no citizen or no non-citizen in this country has a right to end the life of a newborn baby.  That is infanticide and it is punishable under the law.  Let us not try to confuse these issues and the idea of late abortions of a viable new born baby at 24 weeks onwards.  Sadly, babies are not always viable at 24 or 30 weeks but in general they are.  They will be looked after and given every support available.<\/p><p>I cannot prescribe to doctors how to carry out their treatments but we can, as a Legislature and as we are doing, tell them what treatments are legal.  I expect that as medical practice becomes more innovative, sophisticated and complex, much of what the Senator talks about will become more prevalent.  <\/p><p>In terms of there being an anaesthetist present at all times, I fail to see how occasions would arise in the general run of things where there would not be an anaesthetist available, except in an acute emergency and even then a lot of those emergencies would arise in the course of a surgical procedure where there would be an anaesthetist.<\/p><p>I accept the sentiment of what the Senator is bringing to this.  Nobody wants to see any suffering of a mother or an unborn child.  I believe the medical professionals involved will do everything to ensure that.  I have to reiterate, inconvenient and all as it might be, that I cannot prescribe how doctors are to do their work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800014#P00900","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I find that an appalling but unsurprising reply from the Minister.  As part of the untruths that have been perpetrated on the nation and members of his own party for the past number of months, presumably scripted for him by people in his Department, it sanitises what is happening.  He failed to say clearly what type of medical procedures will be allowed.  His failure clearly indicates that all current abortion procedures, many of which are barbaric, and one I described the other day will be allowed should the doctor have the discretion to do them.  I would have expected the Minister to inform the House that most abortions are in the first trimester and most of those will probably be dealt with as medical abortions which involve taking drugs 48 hours apart and creating a situation similar to a miscarriage.<\/p> <p>The drugs cause contractions and expel the unborn baby.  It may take hours or sometimes days for it to happen.  The Minister is a doctor and will be better informed than a Minister for Health who does not have that qualification.  I understand that 8% to 10% of these will fail and a surgical procedure will have to be adopted.  Surgical procedure involves suction aspiration, which uses a powerful suction tube with a sharp cutting edge which is inserted into the womb.  It dismembers the body of the developing baby, sucking foetal parts into the collection bottle.  Tell me if that is disallowed under the Bill.  I am concerned because the taking of human life in whatever way is wrong.  I ask the Minister to tell us whether that will be allowed either in the first or the second trimester.<\/p><p>Saline abortion is another fairly common one.  It involves the injection of drugs or chemicals which cause the death of the child and his or her expulsion from the uterus.  The baby, as the Minister will know, breathes in, swallowing the salt, and is poisoned.  The chemical solution also causes painful burning and the deterioration of the baby's skin.  After about an hour, the child dies.  It is chilling for me to read this out and, I am sure, for people to hear.  Surely it is more chilling for the mother and the child that are going to be put through that experience.  In particular, it is chilling for the doctors to whom the Minister will look to impose it.  They have not had a difficulty in dealing with situations in which there is a medical emergency involving the life of the mother.  They deal with the mother and as a consequence the baby may well lose his or her life.  Nobody in his or her right senses disagrees with that.  There is no good reason suicidality is being included in the Bill.  We will talk about that in detail when we come to section 9.<\/p><p>The Minister has not dismissed for me the totally barbaric procedure that was introduced in the United States of America by President Clinton in the 1990s, which is partial-birth abortion.  In this procedure, the baby is pulled so that the head is left in the womb, after which one sticks a scissors in, opens it wide and sucks the brains out.  This is the type of thing that happened in the Middle Ages and should have no place in modern medicine.  The Minister refers to such procedures as &quot;medical procedures&quot; in his Bill.  I challenge him in the name of everything that is right and in the name of humanity to stand up here and tell us if those acts will be allowed under his medical procedures or not.  He owes us that.  He should not stick to a script with sanitised language.  This is what we are talking about.  This is abortion.  The Minister must tell us whether those things are allowed.  That is why I am moving and will press amendment No. 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800014#P01000","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374146400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>With regard to viability and term limits, the Minister mentioned 24 weeks.  That is where I have a problem.  There is no term limit referred to in the Bill.  I have a friend, to whom I can introduce the Minister, who is just graduating from Trinity College, Dublin.  She was born at 23 weeks, but the Minister, who is a doctor, mentioned 24 weeks.  We must go back to that.  I acknowledge that we are leaving it to the medical profession, but I want to know when a person has a right to realise his or her potential and be born.  Does one get terminated at 22 weeks or 24 weeks?<\/p><p>While I was very pleased to hear the Minister say that everything will be done to support the baby that is born viable, why did the Government promote the Bill without putting a national paediatric budget in place to care for babies who will be born due to the restrictions imposed by the Bill?  There is no paediatric budget to look after babies with life-limiting conditions or multiple disabilities.  While the LauraLynn Foundation and Sunshine Home exist, having been established by a woman who lost two children to cancer, there is no State provision to look after babies who may be born, particularly when their mothers do not want them.  Even if the mother does want the baby, there is nothing to provide for his or her care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800015#Q00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I listened to what the Minister said and I have to say-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800015#Q00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I do not wish to stymie debate, but some of the arguments are becoming circular.

If that is the case, will doctors have the opportunity to refuse training in abortion procedures?  Will new doctors and midwives have the opportunity to refuse training in abortion procedures or will they become part of compulsory qualifications training for them?  The amendment tabled by Senator Jim Walsh on medical procedures is critically important and goes to the core of the Bill.  Will the procedures and drugs used in countries where late term abortions are legal be used here?  Before voting on the Bill, Government Senators would like to know whether such procedures and drugs will be used here.  What is the objective in training provided for staff to ensure no child is born disabled as a result of the termination process?  Does the Minister propose to introduce regulations in this area?<\/p><p> I read an interesting article, the subject of which is a documentary on medical procedures on Channel 4.  The documentary focuses on the work of Dr. John Spencer, the senior clinical director for the Marie Stokes clinic.  He is one of only a handful of doctors in the United Kingdom who perform abortions up to the legal limit of 26 weeks.  In his contribution he outlines that women are hardly ever asked for any more details because they are gruesome.  Why should we ask for more details?  With the vote we cast we are making a decision not for our partners, sisters or wives but for the general population.  We have every right to ask what are the procedures.  Dr. Spencer goes on to explain, in the &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme aired on Channel 4 in 2007, that he broke a huge medical taboo and spelled out exactly what happened during an abortion.  I am quoting some of the comments relevant to the discussion on the procedures used: <blockquote>Though we do not show the aborted foetus, what viewers [viewers being the mothers] will see and hear may very well shock them, but it is a vital contribution to the whole debate.  In the first 12 weeks or so of pregnancy, doctors can use a simple suction procedure.  After that, the surgery becomes more complicated [as outlined by Senator Jim Walsh].  Dr Spencer opens a fresh pack of shiny instruments.  He's an extremely calm, softly spoken man, which somehow makes his words all the more devastating. &quot;The foetus can't come out in one go.  We haven't dilated sufficiently for that.  The foetal parts are soft enough to break apart as they are being removed...&quot;  In other words, he has to dismember the foetus inside the uterus and pull it out, bit by bit.  He uses an ultrasound scan to guide him.  Even then, some body parts are too large to come out intact.<\/blockquote>If we are voting for this-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800015#Q01200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374147000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>What does this have to do with the amendment we are debating?

I do not think that has happened.  I am not sure whether what the Senator said, the desirability of which Senator David Norris concurred with, stands up.  I am sure the Senator made the point in good faith, but we have heard testimony from experts on the pro-choice and pro-life side and abortion practitioners that there is an issue of foetal pain.  We cannot accept Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell's words, with due respect to her, as providing some kind of reassurance that there is no problem.  The Minister has not given us any kind of reply.  For all he said, we do not know whether he has ever thought about the issue of foetal pain.<\/p> <p>The Minister has told us nothing.  When an issue such as this arises in any other legislature, its Members are given some information for the assistance of their understanding and deliberation.  The Minister has done nothing of the kind.  That, in itself, is absolutely shocking.<\/p><p>The Minister stated he can tell doctors what treatments are legal but he seems to be saying we cannot tell doctors what treatment to use.  What is it that prevents him from being prescriptive of medical practices, where necessary, in order to attend to and honour the dignity of the unborn child, even in circumstances where his or her life is to be lost, and requiring, none the less, that the doctor not be prevented from what the legislation requires him or her to do?  This mantra that the Minister cannot be prescriptive of clinical practice is untrue; he can because he is the Minister responsible for health.<\/p><p>The only case in which he should not be prescriptive of medical practitioners would be if his being prescriptive were to have an overreaching effect and prevent practitioners from doing what they would need to do to protect a person's life or health.  Nobody is talking about that here.  If we are, or if there is a circumstance in which the administration of pain relief to an unborn child might cut across a doctor's ability to carry out the medical treatment that the law permits, he should tell us.  He should show us some evidence that he consulted on this.  He should not give us mantras, however.  I ask again for some information, at the very least.  It is simply not acceptable to say he will not engage with us on this because he will not be prescriptive, the result being that he gives us no information.  That shows nothing but contempt for the legislative process.  Even if he regarded Senators as mere advisers, he ought to engage with us.  In theory, at least, we are supposed to be the people who, in conjunction with the Members of the D&aacute;il, decide whether one can do as proposed.  Obviously, that is a very theoretical idea.  I ask the Minister one last time, if only to ease our concerns, to share with us his understanding of the pain issues.<\/p><p>I have not spoken to my amendment No. 37, as other amendments in other groups actually deal with the same topic.  I will not hold up the House at this point; suffice it to say my amendment concerns what happens to a child who is viable.  I did not find the Minister's reassurance in this regard very reassuring at all.  He said that if a viable baby is born, everything will be done to sustain its life.  He told us about infanticide, etc.  We know there will be no destructive procedures permitted after delivery, but many of the amendments ahead of us today, and ahead of the Minister if he stays with us, pertain to what happens prior to and in the course of delivery.  The amendments seek to address what I hope are unintended lacunae in the Bill and not something more sinister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800016#R02800","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374147600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Has the Minister anything else to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800017#S00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1374147600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800017#S00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1374147600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>We are at an impasse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800017#S00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1374147600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I heard that.

What I am seeking in this amendment is confirmation and reassurance regarding the definition of &quot;unborn&quot; as stated in this Bill.  I am not a legal person, so perhaps Senator Bacik can answer this question for me, but will the definition of the &quot;unborn&quot; that is now, for the first time ever, being written into a Bill end up as a precedent for further or additional legislation or interpretation, or is the definition confined to this Bill?  It is for this reason that Senator O'Donnell and I seek to include a definition of &quot;unborn&quot; which deals with the challenge of whether a foetus is compatible with life.  This relates to our debate yesterday on fatal foetal abnormalities.<\/p><p>  The National Women's Council of Ireland and the Irish Family Planning Association have the view that the new definition gives equal protection to a non-viable foetus and a woman and limits the Government's ability to introduce measures in the future to allow terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities where the foetus is incompatible with life.  They refer to the D case.  I know the Minister has received advice from the Attorney General.  However, I find it worrying that the definition, which is included in legislation for the first time in this Bill, limits the possibility of future change or might rule out future legislation, particularly legislation dealing with fatal foetal abnormalities.<\/p><p>  The definition of &quot;unborn&quot; in the Bill relates to human life following implantation until such time as &quot;complete emergence of the life from the body of the woman&quot;.  The explanatory note states that this definition has been inserted to protect the life of a baby who is in the process of being delivered.  As was identified by the expert group, a baby being delivered is not protected under the offence of either murder or abortion.  While applicable within the narrow and defined parameters of the Bill, if this definition is applied in a broader sense, it amends the position the Irish Government adopted in the D <i>v.<\/i> Ireland case before the European Court of Human Rights.  I will not go into detail on this, as my esteemed colleague Senator O'Donnell argued this case yesterday.  I know the Attorney General's advice is a closely guarded secret, even more so than the secret of Fatima.  However, on this issue it would be helpful if that advice was put on the record.  Senator O'Donnell and I do not intend to press this amendment, but it is important for future legislation and law-making that we get clarification on the definition in regard to the advice from the Attorney General, the senior law adviser to the Government. <\/p><p>  The Council for Civil Liberties points to the case of Roche <i>v. <\/i>Roche, in which Mrs. Justice Denham, who is now the Chief Justice, gave insights into the definition of &quot;unborn&quot; as in Article 40.3.3&deg;.  She stated that the concept of the unborn envisages the state of being born, the potential to be born and the capacity to be born, which occurs only after the embryo has been implanted in the uterus of the mother.  The Irish courts can be expected to draw on Supreme Court jurisprudence in Roche <i>v.<\/i> Roche in any future determination of the definition of the &quot;unborn&quot;.  The interpretation section of this Bill does not state that the definitions contained in it apply only to this Bill.  I heard the Minister say yesterday that was the case.  However, I would like to hear the legal response on whether, with regard to any future cases, we have cornered ourselves as law-makers.<\/p><p>  I know there is a political will to deal with this issue in the future and Senators Hayden and Bacik were very eloquent and supportive of the need for legislation dealing with fatal foetal abnormality, but they felt it could not be delivered in this Bill.  Will the definition in this Bill stymie any attempts to introduce legislation to deal with fatal foetal abnormality under a separate Bill?  We need clarification on that.  There may also be circumstances in which a case falling outside of the scope of this Bill requires further interpretation of the meaning of &quot;unborn&quot;.  For example, the dictum of Mrs. Justice Denham in the Roche case would suggest that a non-viable foetus, being incapable of birth, does not come within the constitutional concept of &quot;unborn&quot;.  Therefore, it might be unwise to seek to apply the definition in this Bill to such a case, as to do so might not be in keeping with the constitutional interpretation.  In addition, we might not want to fall foul of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly with regard to protecting women, their treatment during pregnancy, and the issue of fatal foetal abnormality.  I would like legal clarification of the definition of &quot;unborn&quot; and ask the Government to publish the Attorney General's advice on the definition and the reason it was felt it should be included in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800019#U00700","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1374148500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am sorry if Senator Moloney was upset.

Amendment No. 6 is that of Senators Mac Conghail and O'Donnell.  I understand this would basically remove protection from any unborn child prior to viability.  If I am right in that, I want to say that, obviously, I would oppose it.  I do not think I need say any more about that.<\/p><p>  My own amendment No. 8 relates to the issue of viability.  I am not trying to remove any protection for unborn children prior to viability but, in fact, to ensure that, where a child is viable, his or her life would be fully protected.  That involves inserting a definition that the word &quot;&#8220;viable&#8221;, in relation to a pregnancy, means an unborn who, as a matter of medical probability, would, by reason only of his or her gestational age, be capable of surviving outside the womb with the appropriate medical support&#8221;.  Clearly, the purpose of that amendment is to help incorporate the idea of time limits into the legislation.<\/p><p>  The amendment works in conjunction with the suggested amendments to sections 7 to 9, inclusive, and 13, which we will go on to consider.  It also works with amendment No. 37, on which I did not speak earlier and which adds the requirement that &quot;the medical procedure is not intended to end the life of the unborn where such life is viable.&#8221;  This is in conjunction with the definition of viability.  The rationale for all of this has to do with the discussions about whether time limits could be introduced into the Bill.<\/p><p>  The line from the Government on this has been that one cannot time limit a constitutional right.  If one looks at the Government's utterances on this issue, however, there is considerable confusion.  I would quote the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, on this point.  At one point, he said:<blockquote>... the plain meaning of a gestational limit must mean that the test of a real and substantial risk goes out the window after it is reached. ... It is manifestly against the intention of the legislation to introduce such limits.  They would undermine the legislation and change the meaning, giving a right with one hand and taking it back with the other.<\/blockquote>However, the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White's objections expressed there missed the mark.  Time limits refer not to the general rights of a woman but to the procedures which end the life of a viable child.  The Government is at pains to suggest to us that what the eighth amendment provides for is not the termination of a life but the termination of a pregnancy, even if, in many cases, that termination of pregnancy will result inevitably in the termination of the life of the child.  That is why it is so controversial.  However, time limits do not refer to the general rights of the woman.  The idea of time limits refers to the procedures which are used which end the life of a viable child.  The Government is at pains to point out that the woman, under section 9, does not have the right to end a life of a viable child - that is in the context of suicide.  They themselves limit the woman's right in this regard.  What this amendment seeks to do is to express and make explicit that sentiment.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy White, cannot have his cake and eat it.  He cannot claim, on the one hand, that there is no right to kill a viable child under section 9 and then, on the other, claim that making this explicit in the Bill would actually revoke a woman's rights under the Bill.  One cannot make both of those statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800020#V04000","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374149100,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I propose to deal first with amendments Nos. 6 and 8.

That is exactly the legal advice we got from the Attorney General, namely, this Bill has to be in compliance with the Constitution.  In addition, the Bill imposes a clear duty on medical practitioners to make every effort to preserve the life of the foetus.

I do not know what it means.  Anything could be unborn.  For example, the attempts to attribute grotesquely sophisticated capacities to a fertilised egg are unseemly - I have listened to them.  That is the very beginning of life and it is not that I disrespect it.  However, to describe such entities as &quot;citizens&quot; is utterly unreal.  Fertilised eggs are shed by the million on this planet every day.  Nature is very profligate.  I do not understand why we cannot have acceptance that life is a spectrum and it develops.  It does not automatically and intrinsically have these qualities.  Again, I point to the fact that the Roman Catholic Church only changed its mind in this respect less than 200 years ago.  For 18 centuries it took the view that abortion during anything up to 166 days was reasonable, even under Catholic law.<\/p><p>  The definition of &quot;unborn&quot; is an important one for that reason, and I do not terribly like the one in the legislation, which states:<blockquote>&#8220;unborn&#8221;, in relation to a human life, is a reference to such a life during the period of time commencing after implantation in the womb of a woman and ending on the complete emergence of the life from the body of the woman;<br \/>&#8220;woman&#8221; means a female person of any age.<\/blockquote>I will be happy to propose or second the definition contained in the amendment if its proposers or seconders are not able to do so and would be happy to put it back in if we have another opportunity on Report Stage.

The majority - 99.99% - of terminations involve the application of medication, not the procedure outlined by Senator Walsh, who is about 25 years behind the times in the description he gave yesterday, today and other days.  It is wrong that this kind of false, misleading and untrue information is given out.  It is important that I clarify that.<\/p><p>The issue I wish to raise in respect of section 2 is a concern I have had.  In fairness, I have had a detailed discussion with the Minister on the matter, which is the definition of &quot;obstetrician&quot;, and I know the matter is being dealt with.  It was raised at the public hearings.  I refer to what Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe said in those hearings.  This comes from the report on the heads of the Bill.  She is a member of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which proposed that the definition be expanded to cover cases in which an obstetrician who is registered only on the General Medical Register is acting in the role of a consultant, who would be on the specialist register.  These situations occur commonly, such as over weekends, and requiring a full registered consultant to intervene in such a case could cause harmful delays.  This was endorsed by Dr. Rhona Mahony.  The term &quot;obstetrician-gynaecologist&quot; could be used to cover cases in which a specialist has simply chosen not to register, or where a specialist registrar is covering for a registered consultant.<\/p><p>I raise this issue because the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists contacted me last Friday and raised its concern that it had not made progress with the Department on the matter.  There are three parties to this issue: the Department, the institute and the Medical Council.  It is important to deal with the issue.  I was talking not just to one person; I spoke to Professor Robert Harrison, Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe and Dr. Cathy Allen.  There is no legal requirement for obstetricians to be on the specialist register.  The definition in the Bill provides that people who are on that register are defined as &quot;obstetricians&quot;.  Professor Robert Harrison has indicated to me that up to 30% of those involved may not be on the specialist register.<\/p> <p>He has agreed to write to every practising obstetrician to make an application to go on the specialist register.  The process must be expedited to get people on.  The issue arose as when the legislation was being passed a number of years ago, people who had been practising for a number of years were already recognised as being on a specialist register and everybody else coming through after that had come through a training process on the specialist register.  A number of people were offered positions but had not taken them up at the time the legislation went through and were not on the specialist register in real terms.  The issue must be resolved, as I am speaking particularly about smaller units with three obstetricians, for example.  The problem with smaller units is there is a one-in-three call, meaning one consultant is on call from 5 p.m. on Friday right through to 9 a.m. on Monday.  If the person on call is not on a specialist register, there may be a problem with a delay in dealing with a medical procedure.<\/p><p>I raise the matter in this context as it is a genuine concern of mine and the institute.  The matter should be resolved.  It is not just the Department that is involved, and although I know it does not oversee the issue, we must nonetheless progress the matter.  There 12 small units with only three consultants among the 19 units.  There is another matter relating to locums, which are difficult to recruit for smaller units.  I know a major effort is made by the Department and the HSE to ensure all locums are suitably qualified but there may be instances where some locums are not on the specialist register.  We must resolve the issue in the shortest possible time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800021#W03700","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374150300,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Senator Burke is inaccurate in rebutting my comments.

Section 2 of the Bill provides for the commencement of the Bill's provisions and amendment No. 1 made by the D&aacute;il related to the commencement provisions in respect of the private inpatient charge, together with technical amendments regarding other commencement provisions.  To briefly summarise the technical changes to section 2, amendment No. 1 included a provision to commence, upon enactment of the Bill, Part 1 and sections 5 and 14, in addition to section 6 and most of section 7.  Other sections or subsections of the Bill shall be commenced as appropriate by way of commencement order.<\/p><p>As regards the private inpatient charge, sections 13, 15, 16 and 17 all require co-ordination in the commencement.  As a result of discussions the Department has had with the private insurance industry in order to agree a phasing in of charges for all private patients, including those occupying public beds, the Minister has decided to implement these charges from 1 January 2014 to ensure the agreed additional revenue is realised.  As a result, the hospital income will be received in the latter eight months of 2014 rather than in 12 months, based on an implementation date of 1 September 2013.<\/p><p>The rates included in the legislation are set at the level to raise an additional &euro;30 million in hospital revenue in 2014.  This phasing is intended to enable the insurance market to adjust to the new charges without destabilising impacts.  It will also allow for assurances to be provided to insurers that the additional revenues raised in 2014 will amount to &euro;30 million in the calendar year.  The Minister will keep rates under review to deliver the targeted revenue in 2014, as well as for the phasing in over future years.<\/p> <p>As a result of this Bill, the hospital charge for a private day-case patient will be reduced from &euro;828 to &euro;407 in a Category 1 hospital, specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Health Act 1970.  The daily charge for a private patient accommodated overnight in a multi-occupancy room in a Category 1 hospital will be &euro;813.  Currently the equivalent charges applied to a patient in a semi-private bed come to &euro;1,008.  To support this phasing approach, the private health insurers have confirmed their commitment in principle to continuing this year's process of payments to public hospitals in respect of private patients who have already been treated, as well as their commitment to participating in the initiative to be chaired by Mr. Pat McLoughlin that will address costs in the private health insurance industry to support the ongoing sustainability of the market.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 3 passed by the D&aacute;il is purely technical in respect of section 9(<i>c<\/i>)(i), which is unchanged, apart from syntax and numbering, from section 9(<i>c<\/i>) as initiated.  Regarding D&aacute;il approval of the insertion of section 9(<i>c<\/i>)(ii), it has always been the case that where a person &quot;does not avail of&quot; some part of inpatient services under their full or limited eligibility, then under section 52 of the Health Act 1970 they are &quot;deemed not to have full or limited eligibility, as the case may be, for those in-patient services&quot;, and may therefore be charged accordingly.  The insertion of &quot;waives his or her right to avail of, some part of those services&#8221;, mirrors the language in section 13 of the Bill and reflects the freedom of choice that patients currently have to access private care if they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800022#X02100","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374150900,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I welcome the phasing in of these measures.

All of them are technical or refinements of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 or the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 to facilitate the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the courts in dealing with insolvency cases as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 1 is a drafting amendment to delete the reference to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 which is no longer required.

The second change aligns the required notice period in the old section 8 of the 1988 Act, which was only a four day notice to the debtor, with a new 14 day notice period in the revised subsection (1)(<i>c<\/i>) inserted by the 2012 Act as a precondition of a creditor being granted a bankruptcy summons.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 corrects an error in the text of new section 60A(2) in regard to the transfer of staff from the Courts Service to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.

The new subsection provides that an order of discharge from bankruptcy shall provide that any property of the bankrupt then vested in the official assignee shall be returned to the bankrupt.  This provision was inadvertently omitted from the 2012 Act.  Of course, it would only arise when all of the necessary conditions of the bankruptcy, including satisfaction to the fullest extent possible of the claims of the creditors, had been fulfilled.  Any remaining surplus property would then be returned to the former bankrupt.<\/p><p>  Group 2 concerns amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in regard to court jurisdiction.

The new section 49A deals with the situation whereby the debtor terminates the appointment of the personal insolvency practitioner to represent him or her, and its consequences.  The debtor would have to give one month's notice of termination to the personal insolvency practitioner and also notify the insolvency service.  The debtor would have no longer than two months from the date of termination to find a replacement personal insolvency practitioner.  New section 49B deals with a situation in which a personal insolvency practitioner terminates his or her appointment on behalf of a debtor and its consequences.

I am disappointed the Minister of State did not bring forward his own amendments on those issues because they are still flaws in the Bill that should have been rectified at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800026#BB00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1374152700,"counter":374,"content":"<p>When this issue was raised in the House by Senator Jillian van Turnhout and others, the Minister lent his support to the view that the matter should be dealt with as speedily as possible.  He pointed out that the issue was complex and did require careful consideration to ensure that any proposal, such as was canvassed at the time, would correctly balance the constitutional right of the accused to due process with the privacy rights of the complainant.  The Attorney General has advised that a detailed examination is required to precisely identify and provide for the rights concerned.  As it is intended to complete passage of the Bill before the House rises for the summer vacation, the Minister decided that there was not enough time to address comprehensively the issue with the careful consideration required in the time available.  The Minister believes that further consultation with interested parties is necessary to bring forward a robust and workable solution.  In particular, he wants to consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure that any proposal put forward will work in practice to protect the rights concerned and ensure the effectiveness of the prosecution process.  He also believes that any proposal in this regard should be comprehensive and should address the rights of adult as well as child complainants.<\/p><p>The examination and consultation on this subject, proposed by the Law Reform Commission, would be a suitable way of examining such a complex issue.  However, the Minister considers that the timeframe for such examination is not appropriate and that more immediate action is required.  He has, therefore, decided that this issue will be addressed in the forthcoming sexual offences Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation in his Department.  He believes that this is the correct approach to ensuring that that a suitable legislative solution is found as soon as possible to resolve the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800026#BB00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374152700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I support everything that has been said on this subject and I take the Minister of State at his word.

The state of being unborn is defined in the Bill as ending on the complete emergence of the life from the body of the woman.  Therefore, until complete emergence occurs the unborn is in principle vulnerable to a lawful termination under the Bill.  What the Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated this morning is wrong.

A fine or 14 years in prison will be the penalty for deliberate destruction, but doctors will be exempt as long as they have filed the necessary paperwork.  What if that paperwork is delayed or, worse, falsified due to people being overworked?  Will it be fines for doctors and specialists and prison for nurses and midwives, depending on how easily they can be replaced in their workplaces?  This question has been asked by health professionals across the country, particularly in the designated hospitals outlined in the Schedule.  Even if it was found that a doctor deliberately ended the life of a baby in an avoidable scenario, he or she would probably only be fined.

I decided not to press the amendment to give the Minister a chance to examine the evidence over the weekend and to give us an opportunity to reflect as well.

Generally, although not always, when a Bill is brought before the House there is a breakdown of the additional cost to the Exchequer.  In this case there is no breakdown of the cost the Bill will impose on the Exchequer.

Will a dedicated budget be made available by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform just to fund abortions alone or will it come out of the budgets that are given to the various HSE managers?<\/p><p>Finally, there is the issue of abortion tourism, for want of a better word, which has been raised with many Members of the Oireachtas.  A woman who is seeking a late term abortion and whose own jurisdiction, be it the UK, Canada, France or Italy, has term limits, would be able to avail of a late term abortion in the Republic of Ireland due to there being no term limit on abortions in this country.  Who will pay for that if it happens, or will the Government say it is only available to women who have Irish passports?

One has been referred to by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, among others, and concerns the lack of term limits.  At a minimum evil, on foot of avoidable circumstances in situations provided for in section 9, a child at the cusp of viability, who is at viability or is later brought into the world in circumstances where, at best, the child may be extremely sick, the Minister said such children might have to be taken into care.  We all accept that such an unfortunate outcome for a child is perfectly understandable and the process leading to it is perfectly legitimate, where doctors intervene to deal with the physical illness of the child's mother, and do so on the back of an assessment that the threat of suicide amounts to a risk of suicide, but it is unconscionable that should be allowed to happen to a child under the circumstances in section 9.  I point out to Senator Gilroy that I talked about how a threat amounts to a risk to life but he can check the record on that point.  The lack of term limits is one issue.<\/p><p>  A related issue is whether there is a lack of protection for the child at cusp of viability or post-viability in the womb with regard to the procedures permitted.  The Minister sought to reassure us when he said that if a viable baby is born, everything will be done to sustain the life of that baby.  No one suggests at this point, although I have questions about how the eighth amendment might be interpreted in future cases, that care will not be taken once a child is alive having been delivered or brought out on foot of a procedure under section 9.  However, there is a question about what ought to be done in terms of the child, what procedures the doctor is required to execute and whether the doctor is obliged to ensure a child at viability is protected in the course of the carrying out of a section 9 procedure or whether the obligation to preserve the life of the child arise only where the child emerges alive.  That is at the core of the problem of the duty to the child prior to the procedure where the child is viable or near viability.  It arises in two ways, one because the legislation does not confer a specific duty to protect the child in that situation and second because of the use of language and the word 'ended' in various sections of the Bill that I seek to amend.<\/p> <p>I am speaking to amendments Nos. 13, 24-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800037#NN03100","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374158700,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 13, 24, 31 and 32 are being discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800038#OO00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374158700,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 32 is in the name of Senator Healy Eames so I will speak to amendments Nos. 13, 24 and 31.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 13 seeks to delete the words &quot;is ended&quot; and substitute &quot;may be lost&quot; from section 7 so it would refer to the lawfulness of procedures in the course of which, or as a result of which, an unborn human life may be lost.  Amendment No. 24 proposes a similar change in the context of the emergency section 8 procedures, and amendment No. 31 refers to it in the context of what I might describe as the infamous section 9 procedures.<\/p><p>The word &quot;ended&quot; connotes a deliberate act whereby &quot;lost&quot; suggests the death of the child is a side-effect of the intended aim of the medical procedure.  All along we have been reassured that what is being legalised are procedures which are not directed to the destruction of the unborn but to the saving of the life of the mother.  I suggest the word &quot;lost&quot; provides greater legal reassurance to those practitioners not involved in the deliberate destruction of the unborn, namely practitioners operating according to sections 7 and 8.<\/p><p>In response to critics of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013 who have pointed out the Bill permits the directed intentional destruction of an unborn child even after the point of viability, it has been repeatedly claimed that no viable unborn child will be lawfully aborted pursuant to sections 7, 8 or 9, but instead any such child shall be delivered early with every effort made thereafter to sustain its life after delivery.  It is relevant to critically evaluate this response in light of the actual wording of the Bill.  Most importantly, the express definition of the medical procedure which sections 7, 8 and 9 provide shall be lawful leaves no doubt the Bill only makes lawful procedures which are fatal for the unborn.  The wording used at the start of each of these sections is utterly unambiguous and speaks about where life is ended.  Section 7(1) states: &quot;It shall be lawful to carry out a medical procedure in respect of a pregnant woman in accordance with this section in the course of which, or as a result of which, an unborn human life is ended...&quot;.  Thus it is only a medical procedure during, or as a result of, which unborn life is ended that is made lawful by the Bill.<\/p><p>It is necessary the plain legal consequences of this definition are understood.  The Bill does not make lawful any form of termination of pregnancy which does not end an unborn human life.  It does not confer any lawfulness on a procedure which disables or injures severely; it only confirms lawfulness on those procedures which actually end in the death of the unborn.  It follows the Bill neither requires nor renders lawful the premature delivery of a potentially viable unborn child as an alternative to the medical procedure defined and made lawful by the Bill, a procedure in the course of which, or as result of which, unborn life is ended.  There is no duty on the doctor to preserve life at that point or no protection from civil or criminal liability for the doctor who preserves life.<\/p><p>If the Government truly believed its own claim that when an unborn child is viable terminations of pregnancy under the Bill should not take the form of a procedure which ends the life of the unborn, which is the only procedure defined and made lawful by the Bill, but should take some other form such as premature delivery, one would expect the Government to be open to an amendment adding an express provision for confirmation that the Bill does not permit the lawful ending of the life of an unborn child which is reasonably deem to be viable or potentially viable.  It is very difficult to understand why the Government would oppose such an amendment if it is truly intended the Bill should operate in this way.<\/p><p>One would also expect to find provision in the Bill addressing the civil liability of a doctor who delivers a viable unborn child prematurely thereby causing injury to the child.  As noted above, such procedure is neither mentioned nor made lawful by the Bill because it is not a procedure which ends an unborn human life and therefore falls outside the definition of the medical procedure made lawful by sections 7, 8 and 9.<\/p><p>It is no answer to the above criticisms to include an express reference in the Bill to a duty to make all efforts to preserve the life of a child after delivery.  We are not speaking about after delivery; we are speaking about what happens before and during delivery.  We are speaking about the procedure and not the post-emergent situation.  There is no requirement that any such delivery must occur in the first place because there is no duty imposed on a doctor by the Bill.  I can hardly believe I am reading these words but they are true.  There is no requirement that any such delivery must occur in the first place, because no duty is imposed on a doctor by the Bill, either implicitly or expressly, not to end viable unborn human life.  On the contrary, an obstetrician who chooses to terminate a pregnancy by a premature delivery of the unborn rather than by a procedure which ends the life of the unborn will not enjoy the protection of the Bill.  Quite perversely, the obstetrician might be better off legally speaking from the point of view of his or her self-interest if the child died during or as a result of the premature delivery than if the child survived.  If the child's life is ended in the course of or as a result of the premature delivery, the delivery would fall under the definition of medical procedure in the Bill and would therefore be lawful, but if the child survives and suffers injury a result of the premature delivery the lawfulness of the procedure, at least in terms of civil liability, is left wholly undetermined by the Bill.<\/p><p>On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il the Minister stated the purpose of the legislation is not to regulate procedures which do not constitute abortion or to dictate the practice of obstetrics, and to this end, using the word &quot;is&quot; as opposed to &quot;may&quot; and the phrase &quot;may be ended&quot; as opposed to &quot;is ended&quot; would lead to the inclusion of other procedures, for example amniocentesis, which are not intended to be included, and that due to the unpredictability and complexity of these rare medical cases it was not desirable to provide legislation for a specific referral path.  Such an answer causes concern.  Only a contorted reading of the proposed amendment could view it as including procedures such as amniocentesis, since subsequent subsections clearly establish the only category of medical procedures contemplated by the Bill are those which respond to a real and substantial risk of loss of maternal life as a necessary means of averting such a risk and which take account of the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  Thus only maternal life-saving medical procedures which threaten the survival of the unborn are contemplated.<\/p><p>Further, as the Bill stands, with the inclusion of &quot;is&quot; instead of &quot;may be&quot;, it is difficult to see the purpose of the phrase &quot;has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable&quot;.  This phrase only comes in to protect people who end up ending the life.  This is the wording of the Bill.  Such a phrase is surely redundant where legal clarity is being offered to only those procedures which inevitably end the life of the unborn.  It is not sufficient to suggest, as some have done, there is no need for these amendments since subsequent subsections enshrine the idea of a need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  The argument these people make seems to be that the incorporation of the &quot;duty&quot; ensures that the fact that the Bill contemplates only procedures ending the life of the unborn does not entail lesser protection for procedures which do not end unborn life.<\/p> <p>Yet, as previously stated, that duty to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable is rendered redundant by the exclusion from the Bill's protection of procedures which do not end the life of the unborn.  We are left with a Bill that clarifies and protects only those procedures resulting in the death of the unborn.  Any other type of procedure is not protected and is not clarified, as I have said.  If my amendment is not accepted, it seems clear that the Bill will have the unintended side effect - I hope it is unintended and that it will be changed - of incentivising for medical practitioners foetal destruction over foetus-saving procedures.  That is the most logical deduction from the legal fact that the Bill only protects and clarifies the former category of the medical procedure.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800038#OO00300","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374159300,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I will be brief, because Senator Mullen has covered much of what I wanted to say.  I too have tabled this amendment, changing \"is ended\" to \"may be ended\" in the hope that it may provide some change to the intent of the Bill.  I have a legal opinion which states that, most importantly of all, the expressed definition of \"medical procedure\" provided for by sections 7 to 9, inclusive, leaves no doubt that the Bill only makes lawful procedures that are fatal for the unborn.  The wording used at the start of each of these sections is utterly unambiguous in this regard: \"It shall be lawful to carry out a medical procedure in respect of a pregnant woman in accordance with this section in the course of which, or as a result of which, an unborn human life is ended.\"  The Bill does not make lawful any form of termination of pregnancy which does not end an unborn life.  One would expect the Minister to be open to some amendment in this area so that it is completely and totally unambiguous and does not give rise to a situation that occurs in many other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>People are being selective in picking up some of the points I am making.  I am talking about other jurisdictions, but this is a first step and the first time we are introducing and legalising abortion in our legislation.  Being aware of judicial activism, we need to ensure that the wording in these sections, as well as some later sections, is as tight as possible.  Let me mention the situation in other countries in which a baby is born and technically the obstetrician may find himself or herself liable if a baby on the cusp of viability pulls through.  All the medical evidence given at the committee hearings was that only half of those babies born after a gestation period of 23 to 26 weeks will survive, and half of these will suffer cerebral palsy or some other brain injury and will be disabled.  The issue facing the obstetrician is that if the baby dies, he or she is totally covered by the legislation, but if the baby survives there is nothing in the Bill specifically that will give the obstetrician confidence that he or she is covered in that situation.  Some of the medical profession have sought legal advice independently on that.  I am told that what happens in other countries as a result of the issue of liability is that obstetricians are under pressure from the authorities not to make strenuous efforts to save the life of the baby.  I have been told by medical practitioners that in other countries, when the baby is in the process of being born, potassium chloride is injected into the heart and that terminates the life of the baby.  Some have said that this lacuna and the fact there is no limit on the term of gestation in the Bill will make the situation worse than in England, where there is a cut-off point of 24 weeks for abortion.  Therefore, the likelihood of such a situation occurring in England is lower than it is here.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the amendment and, if he has a different viewpoint from the legal advice on medical liability that medical practitioners have received, I ask him to state precisely the position on liability should the baby survive, to assure medical practitioners with regard to their exposure to medical liability proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800039#PP00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374159300,"counter":685,"content":"<p>My amendments are to sections 7 and 8.

Up to now the practice has been that should the mother's life need to be saved, that is the goal, but it may mean the unintentional taking of the baby's life.  I understand that everybody is fine with that.  What worries me about the wording in the section is that it makes clear that an unborn human life is ended.  This is actually worse than the current practice.  Doctors practise, at the moment, with a duty of care to mother and child.  For that reason, we should leave it at \"may be\".  The word \"is\" makes it dangerous for the unborn, but the words \"may be\" gives hope that the life of the unborn might be saved.  This does not take away from the overall thrust of section 7.  There is every reason a doctor will intervene to save the life of the mother, because there is real evidence of a physical illness.  Why not just leave the words \"may be\"?  This puts the duty of care in the doctor's hands, and he or she can also save the baby's life, which is the current practice.<\/p><p>The aim of this amendment is to allow medical practitioners to intervene to save a mother's life in a manner that allows them to attempt to save the baby's life also.  The current wording, with &quot;is&quot; instead of &quot;may be&quot;, presumes that the baby's life will be ended.  That is dangerous, and in fact does not render lawful the saving of the baby's life.  There is no reason for the current wording to remain other than to pave the way for situations in which no attempts will be made to save the baby's life.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this amendment, given that the intention is to clarify existing practice.<\/p><p>I will now address my second amendment, amendment No. 32 in this grouping.  Amendment No 32 seeks to amend section 9, which deals with the risk of loss of life from suicide.  Section 9(1) states: &quot;It shall be lawful to carry out a medical procedure in respect of a pregnant woman in accordance with this section in the course of which, or as a result of which, an unborn human life is ended&quot;.  Again, in this amendment I wish to delete the word &quot;is&quot; and substitute &quot;may be&quot;, because it gives a chance to the baby.  In both of these sections we are stating that the mother's life is the primary reason for the intervention, but with these amendments, I am requesting that we do not use the phrase &quot;is ended&quot;, as under this wording the baby's life will definitely be taken, but the words &quot;may be&quot; give a chance for the baby to be also saved.<\/p> <p>I want to add that I am concerned about another inference that may be drawn from the Minister's decision not to include the words \"may be\" as we have proposed.  Senators Mullen and Walsh referred to this.  I have tabled another amendment that makes this point.  If the word \"is\" is retained in the Bill, a doctor who saves a baby may end up being liable if that baby ends up with an injury.  That might mean there is less of a reason for the doctor to want to save the baby.  This is a very serious issue and we need to tease it out here.  Much of what I am saying might be uncomfortable.  We need to do it here so that doctors, mothers and babies do not have to face these situations somewhere else.  We are framing the law now.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800039#PP00700","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374159900,"counter":691,"content":"<p>It is often claimed that no Government has done anything on this issue for 21 years.

The same language was used in respect of saving the woman's life, for example.  The difference is that this Government has added on a doctor.  If the 2002 referendum had been passed, there would have been a requirement for just one medical practitioner.  I mention this to highlight some of the exaggerations we are hearing during this debate.  I think everybody on this side of the House supported the referendum we proposed in 2002.

I think we need to be careful in our language.  The medical professionals clearly said they work to ensure foetal maturity and foetal viability.  That is what they are about.  Article 40.3.3&deg; is a clear constitutional provision that protects unborn life.  It is clear, therefore, that one cannot intentionally end that life if it is possible to pursue another option while vindicating the woman's right to life.  I would like to clear up one of the many claims that have been made.  A great deal has been said about the term limits in the UK.  This is relevant in the overall context of the use of facts in this debate.  It is correct to say that section 1(1)(a) of the UK Abortion Act 1967 provides for a 24-week limit.  One should also refer to section 1(1)(c) of that Act, however, because it does not impose a time limit on abortion in Britain where \"the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman\".

Bizarrely, he chose to cite amniocentesis but did not illustrate what harm such unintended inclusivity would do.  It should be remembered that we are discussing rendering lawful a procedure that may result in the unborn child's life ending.  The reason for inserting the words &quot;may be&quot; is to cover circumstances in which the unborn child's life does not end.  There would not be any actual mischief even if, as the Minister claimed, using these words would include cases such as amniocentesis, even if the latter was not the offence.  If that were to be the case, there would be no harm done.  It is, however, ridiculous to suggest it would include such things.  The most basic understanding of the rules of statutory interpretation - the Attorney General certainly has such an understanding - would allow a court to understand that when one is interpreting legislation, one does not only interpret matters literally, certainly not if to do so would lead to an absurdity.  Various rules of statutory interpretation include, for example, what is called the purposive approach where the courts examine what is the intent of legislation and what it is designed to achieve.  Clearly, the amendment is designed to achieve the protection - at this point it is not a duty - of doctors who might carry out a procedure which did not result in the death of the child.  As the Minister pretends and insists, albeit without reassuring legislative support, this is supposedly being done under section 9.  There are supposed to be cases where a child might be brought out alive and its life preserved because it has reached a point of viability.  However, the Minister does not confer any protection in the relevant section 9 for a doctor in such circumstances because the only thing being made lawful is a procedure that ends the life of the child.  There is a massive lacuna there.<\/p><p>To respond to Senator Thomas Byrne-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800041#RR00700","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374160500,"counter":736,"content":"<p>It is not necessary to respond to other Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800041#RR00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374160500,"counter":737,"content":"<p>The issue the Senator raised contributes to a potential misunderstanding of what I have proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800041#RR00900","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374160500,"counter":738,"content":"<p>The only answer that matters is that of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800041#RR01000","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374160500,"counter":739,"content":"<p>While I do not propose or desire to speak for the entire evening, I want to address a criticism that has been made of my point.

My question is very simple.  There are two stages to this issue, there is post 12 weeks and post-viability.  We know that a baby at 12 weeks will not be viable.

We did not see those little babies for four months after they were born because they could not be visited except by their parents.  The fundamental question is this: if the Minister is saying that a baby will be delivered on the cusp plus post-viability and everything will be done to save that baby's life why does he not put that wording in the Bill?  I want the Minister to specifically answer that question.  Why does the Minister not put that wording in the Bill?  I heard Senator van Turnhout say that we always hear \"It was the Attorney General who told me\".  We get tired hearing this when we do not know what the Attorney General is actually saying.  I will return to the second question which concerns pre-viability.  The Minister mentioned from 12 weeks to viability, so there is a potential ten weeks.  What will happen to that baby?

This deals with a situation where the life is ended.  Where a life is not ended but the baby is seriously injured and disabled, what is the position?

My understanding of the legislation we are discussing relates to formalising the law as it currently stands in this country and to give clarity to the current legal position.  There are about 50,000 live births in this country every year.  For every 50,000 live births here every year there are approximately 14,000 miscarriages.  A considerable number of those miscarriages take place between 14 and 16 weeks, though the majority take place at a much earlier stage.<\/p> <p>That figure should have been 70,000 births and 14,000 miscarriages.

Whereas what we are talking about for the last while related to the question of the protection for doctors who carry out a procedure that did not take the life of the unborn - it is no consolation to me to think that doctors might none the less risk not taking the life of the child on the basis that they would be covered by their professional indemnity; I found that a very worrying sop - this amendment relates to the last issue to which I referred, namely, the certification as distinct from the carrying out of the procedure.  This does not relate to the emergency procedures.  A good faith certification does not arise in that situation, but it does relate to the section 7 procedure and the section 9 procedure, and it also relates to the issue of the review of the relevant decision.  In the situation where abortion is not certified at first instance, the review committee has to apply the same test and ask whether there is a real and substantial risk of loss of life, and whether &quot;in their reasonable opinion (being an opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable) that risk can only be averted by carrying out the medical procedure,&quot; that risk can only be averted by carrying out a medical procedure referred to in section 7(1) or section 9 (1), as the case may be.<\/p><p>  We have a distinction here between the role of the person carrying out the procedure and the people who certify the procedure in the first place.  As I pointed out to the Minister, it is the people who certify the procedure that must have regard to the need to preserve the life of the unborn as far as practicable, and not the people who carry it out.  Let us look at the quality of that certification, given the far-reaching consequences for the unborn child, in the context of section 9.  In any situation where medical professionals are asked to certify that a procedure resulting in the death of the unborn is the only way by which a risk to life can be averted, it is reasonable to expect that they would be informed by the relevant clinical evidence.  There are problems with the good faith test because of its subjective nature.<\/p><p>  My amendments provide that having examined the pregnant woman, instead of &quot;having jointly certified in good faith&quot;, they would be required to &quot;have regard to the relevant clinical evidence and jointly certify&quot;.  Therefore, we are not talking about a requirement of good faith, which is subjective.  We are talking about a requirement of having regard to the relevant clinical evidence, which is something that can be judged more objectively.<\/p><p>  There were hardly any medical negligence cases in Ireland until 1989.  In that year, the case of Dunne <i>v. <\/i>National Maternity Hospital came before the Supreme Court and remains the seminal case in medical negligence to the present day.  Two of the principles set down by former Chief Justice Finlay for establishing medical negligence are as follows:<blockquote>The true test for establishing negligence in diagnosis or treatment on the part of a medical practitioner is whether he has been proved to be guilty of such failure as no medical practitioner of equal specialist or general status and skill would be guilty of if acting with ordinary care.<br \/>If the allegation of negligence against a medical practitioner is based on proof that he deviated from a general and approved practice, that will not establish negligence unless it is also proved that the course he did take was one which no medical practitioner of like specialisation and skill would have followed had he been taking the ordinary care required from a person of his qualification.<\/blockquote>These principles helped found the test of a reasonable standard of care, which is the main test for establishing liability in medical negligence cases.  Medical professionals have to act with ordinary reasonable care.  If the diagnosis or treatment were reasonable, then there can be no finding of negligence.  At our hearings, Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Craven pointed out that there is a higher test applying in the case of negligence.  He stated:<blockquote>In so far as the law of tort is concerned, it used to be dealt with in the context of whether one followed, adhered to or subscribed to a general and approved practice, in other words one which was followed by a responsible, reputable or respectable body of professional opinion. That was the classical test and the classical formulation. <\/blockquote>He pointed out that this has undergone something of a transformation in recent years, especially since HM <i>v<\/i>. the HSE and a decision of Mr. Justice Charleton from July 2011.  The key point from that decision is that evidence-based professional guidelines were deemed to be incorporated into the appropriate standard of care, and Dr. Craven stated that &quot;seemed to represent something of a shift in so far as the courts are concerned from this deference to clinicians in terms of what is or is not appropriate.&quot;  He went on to state:<blockquote>A further issue has also arisen.  In its decision in the case of Kearney <i>v.<\/i> McQuillan, the Supreme Court went further in stating that health care professionals owe and always have owed a duty to patients to protect their constitutional rights.<\/blockquote>Underscoring both of these cases seems to be the requirement for some evidence in terms of one's evidence.  In order to fulfil ethical and legal obligations, there must be some evidence in terms of what medical practitioners do, and that is about the only way the ethical injunction <i>primum non nocere<\/i>, or &quot;first, do no harm&quot; can be fulfilled.<\/p><p>  When it comes to the question of certifying certain opinions in sections 7, 8, 9 and 13, in each case there is a requirement that the opinion be formed in good faith only.  When one is relying on the good faith safety justification, that justification will always succeed.  Trying to demonstrate <i>mala fides<\/i>, bad faith, or even improper motivation in this area, is virtually impossible. There is a whole series of cases where this has arisen under the old mental health legislation over the past 40 years.  With respect, it seems what is happening in this Bill represents a very old fashioned approach which is inconsistent with the ethical and now the legal and constitutional duty that the courts have elaborated on over the past two years.  A good faith opinion, which is accepted without any reference or is unsupported by any reference to evidence-based practice, is regressive or potentially dangerous.  That is the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800044#UU00800","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374162300,"counter":818,"content":"<p>It is not good faith, by definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800044#UU00900","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1374162300,"counter":819,"content":"<p>It is subjective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800044#UU01000","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374162300,"counter":820,"content":"<p>Senator Gilroy, your interventions might be unhelpful to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800044#UU01100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1374162300,"counter":821,"content":"<p>If only a good faith opinion is required but there is no reference to evidence-based practice, we are going backwards and not forwards.

There is a danger in relying on a good-faith opinion.  How can we ethically justify the taking of a life of a baby without clinical markers?  The Minister has given us many assurances, but, to be fair, once this law is passed they will carry no weight.  There is nothing in the legislation to prevent two psychiatrists from signing away the life of an unborn child once they claim it is in their reasonable opinion.  Since there are no clinical markers to judge whether the intervention is necessary, they are free to sanction as many abortions as they wish and the absence of that objective standard concerns me greatly.  Will the Minister comment on why there are no clinical markers?<\/p><p>I have before me a letter from a doctor.  She has given her Medical Council registration number.  She has spoken about her experiences working in the United Kingdom although she is now working here.  She said to me that a consultant in obstetrics in the United Kingdom with whom she worked some nine years ago advised her at the outset that he would do any abortion on any patient who requested it.  He said that he could rely on like-minded colleagues in psychiatry and general practice to sign the necessary legal forms.  The justification offered for this policy was that no doctor could be certain that a woman with an unwanted pregnancy would not complete suicide.<\/p><p>The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, justified the need for the Bill on the same grounds.  This is the danger of relying on a good-faith opinion.  The rate of suicide among women in pregnancy in Ireland is of the order of between one in every 250,000 and one in every 500,000.  Thank God, it is a rare event.  However, we know that women experience suicidal thoughts in pregnancy.  In fact, approximately 15% of pregnant women experience suicidal thoughts, but this does not mean that they complete suicide.<\/p><p>I return to my original question.  How can we ethically justify the taking of a baby's life without reliable clinical markers?  How can we rely on good faith when we know there is boundless evidence to show that after several years this becomes common practice?

Senator Mullen speaks of the test of reasonableness.  He quotes from the Dunne case of 1989.  However, the precedent of reasonableness was established long before that.  If memory serves me correctly, it dates back to 1856.  Blyth <i>v.<\/i> Birmingham Waterworks Company is the test case during which the Lord Justice at the time described reasonableness as the standard of the man on the Clapham omnibus or the man on the street.  That is what is considered reasonable.  Let us consider reasonableness and juxtapose it with the other term in the section, that is, good faith.  There is no possibility of any reasonable person acting in good faith while ignoring the medical evidence.  Senator Mullen's concerns are entirely and completely unfounded.  They are selective and perhaps even amount to a misunderstanding of the intention of the legislation.<\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames made a point about there being no markers for suicide.  She absolutely and fundamentally misunderstands the nature of suicide.  There are many objective markers.  If we are to say that our consultant psychiatrists are unable to diagnose suicide to within the standard of reasonableness which is required under this legislation, then we might as well say that there is no such thing as suicide or mental illness or the psychiatric profession.  That is what we suggesting if we say what Senator Healy Eames has said.<\/p><p>  I made the point to Senator Mullen some time ago that it is not the threat of suicide that we are legislating for, but the risk of suicide.  The risk of suicide sometimes, but only sometimes, includes the threat of suicide.  Other markers include the formulation of a plan, suicidal ideation or perhaps some last final acts.  There are many markers that are absolutely, 100% objective and any psychiatrist who says there is none should not be a psychiatrist.  It is as simple as that.  It would be like a cardiologist being unable to diagnose heart failure.  To say or suggest otherwise is to move into an area that is extraordinarily dangerous and amounts to denying that suicide and suicidal ideation are medical emergencies.  If we accept that suicide and suicidal ideation and intent are not medical emergencies, then we are in trouble.  Further, I believe we are in real trouble by making this argument in the first place.<\/p><p>  I started work as a psychiatric nurse in 1984.  The stigma associated with mental illness and suicide in 1984 was appalling.  We have made, or, we appear to have made, great strides in reducing that stigma.

It is important to note that the level of litigation in medical negligence is highest in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology.  Obstetricians are always remarkably careful in how they manage their patients and that will continue.  The level of litigation is high in this area not because people intentionally go out to cause a problem but because of the difficulties in the job that they must deliver on and the work they must do.  Unfortunately, there is a high degree of litigation as a result.  It is something that they must live with.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the area of obstetrics and gynaecology.  I understand that the life expectancy of a consultant obstetrician is 63 years because of the stress levels associated with the job.<\/p><p>If I understood Senator Mullen correctly, he said that medical negligence really only took off after 1989.  However, medical negligence claims were around long before 1989.  While the rules may have changed somewhat in 1989, it was not the case that there was no medical negligence pre-1989.  Perhaps I picked up the comments of Senator Mullen wrongly in that regard.<\/p><p>In fairness to every consultant and doctor in the country, they intend and will continue to protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn.

I draw the attention of the House to a report  by Dr. Eleanor Corcoran from County Donegal, a consultant psychiatrist of 27 years' experience in the area of suicidal behaviour, its management and prevention.  She states that in 2011 there were 525 suicides in Ireland.  Of those only 100, or approximately one in five, were women.  Approximately one in five of all suicides in Ireland, as I understand from the Department's figures are young men.  When we are debating suicide we should not narrow or demean the debate by saying that it pertains only to women because it is a major problem in our country due to the financial pressures and burdens on people.  If we really want to deal in a societal way with the scourge of suicide we would take a more holistic approach than the knee-jerk reaction of introducing the Bill before us now.

In fact, we heard one very eminent suicide prevention expert, Professor Kevin Malone, warn about the dangers of foregrounding suicidal feelings in the way the Bill does.  Although I am not an expert, I believe I am on very safe ground in warning about the wider collateral dangers of the legislation.  However, my primary focus is on the danger to the unborn child of allowing abortion in situations where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother originating in the threat of suicide.  I certainly am on safe and accurate ground in so characterising it.  We have heard all about the incidence of false positives and so.  There are clinical markers for suicide, but they are very uncertain.  The reality is that psychiatrists find it extremely difficult to know whether a threat of suicide is likely, tragically, to materialise.  We heard other psychiatrists saying it should not be a matter for their profession to determine this issue at all.  Senator John Gilroy is not doing me justice in this instance, because there is a clear problem here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800047#XX00300","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164100,"counter":858,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800047#XX00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164100,"counter":859,"content":"<p>Senator Gilroy also raised the question of reasonableness.

However, that is not what the legislation says.  In fact, the notion of a reasonable opinion is actually turned upside down in the legislation because it defines for us what a reasonable opinion is.

With respect, that is the point which has been missed.  The Bill does not require that an opinion be reasonable and in good faith.  Rather, it tells us what \"reasonable\" means for the purpose of this legislation.  It is not an objective test but a good faith test which is entirely subjective.  As I said in my opening comments, it is extremely difficult to make a finding of mala fides.  What I am proposing here as being desirable and necessary given the life and death issues at stake is a more objective test which would require that the certification be jointly certified and have regard to the relevant clinical evidence.  In other words, if people have their evidence right, we need not worry about good faith or bad faith because they will have to do what is right according to the evidence.  That is safer from the point of view of protecting all the lives involved.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke referred to medical negligence and the likelihood or otherwise of litigation.  The point here is that the victim will not be around to litigate, which is why we have to ensure there is a safe and objective test.  I already pointed out that the clinical grounds are not actually mentioned, although they are referenced in another section.<\/p><p>On the point raised by Senator David Cullinane, there is no contradiction between having problems with a good faith test and also saying one has a problem with, as he put it, the decision-making capacity of some medical professionals.  To be clear on this, we all trust women and we all trust doctors.  Sometimes, however, there are doctors who perhaps cannot be trusted and that is why we have legislation.  The whole problem with the abortion on grounds of suicide provision is that it opens up what many of us see as the likelihood of an abortion-on-request scenario, as we set out on Second Stage.  The problem is that not all doctors believe they have a duty of care to the unborn.  In that sense, I have to say in all honesty that I do not trust all doctors.  I do not trust those doctors who came into this House and said abortion should be available as a matter of choice.  I do not see how those doctors can be trusted to protect unborn children under this legislation.  I do not think it makes me a bad person to say there are doctors out there who cannot be trusted in this regard.  As I said yesterday, there are doctors in Britain trained to save lives as obstetricians who are skilled in the destruction of life as abortionists.  That is the reality of the Western world.<\/p><p>It is a little unfair to say to those of us who have concerns about this legislation that we do not trust certain people.  The whole point of good legislation is that one does not have to rely on trust.  If we trusted everybody we would all be angels and there would be no need for legislation at all.  Let us make credible arguments and be fair to each other.  I certainly trust doctors.  Sadly, I do not think it is possible to trust all doctors.  That is probably why we have a fitness to practise committee at the Medical Council and why there are occasionally cases of breach of good practice which sometimes result in practitioners being struck off the medical register.  That is the world we are living in, not a perfect world in which everybody acts ethically.  It is why we need law and it is why I am proposing the tightening up of this unfortunate legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800047#XX00700","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164100,"counter":862,"content":"<p>Does the Senator wish to press the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800047#XX00800","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164100,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800047#XX00900","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1374164100,"counter":864,"content":"<p>Question put: &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164100,"counter":865,"content":"<p>As there are no tellers on the N&iacute;l side, the vote will not proceed, and so I declare the question carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800047#XX01050","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1374164100,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Question declared carried.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164700,"counter":867,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 16 is in the name of Senator Walsh, amendments Nos. 16, 17, 20, 22, 25 to 28, inclusive, 35, 36, 41 and 55 are related, amendment No. 17 is an alternative to amendment No. 16, amendment No. 26 is an alternative to amendment No. 25, and amendment No. 36 is an alternative to amendment No. 35.

Where subsection (1)(<i>a<\/i>)(ii) states &quot;which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable&quot;, I propose the insertion of the words &quot;which has regard to the right of life of the unborn&quot;.  My motivation for doing that is that I am using the words that are in the Constitution, namely, &quot;the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn&quot;.  I seek to have those changes made for the reasons I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164700,"counter":869,"content":"<p>Does any other Member wish to speak on the other amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800048#ZZ00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374164700,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to amendment No. 20.

These amendments would have the effect of deleting the words &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  In regard to the latter, the words &quot;as far as practicable&quot; are taken directly from Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup> of the Constitution, which states: &quot;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, in far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&quot;<\/p><p>  In relation to the amendment to change the definition of &quot;reasonable opinion&quot;, section 7(1)(<i>a<\/i>)(ii) provides that a termination can only be carried out where the medical practitioners have formed an opinion described in the following terms, &quot;in their reasonable opinion ... that risk can only be averted by carrying out the medical procedure&quot;.  Section 7(1)(<i>a<\/i>)(ii) further provides the reasonable opinion must be &quot;formed in good faith&quot; and one &quot;which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable&quot;.  These two requirements place further obligations on the medical practitioners before they arrive at a view that in their reasonable opinion the risk can only be averted by carrying out the medical procedure.  These requirements and obligations are expressed in a language that follows very precisely the test laid down in the X case.  That is why as part of the certification process where there is a real and substantial risk to a pregnant woman's life, doctors are required specifically to consider whether it is practicable to preserve the unborn human life.<\/p><p>  The language put forward in the amendments is not expressed in the terms required by Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup> of the Constitution and as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case and could have unintended consequences.  However, in practical terms, the Bill, as currently drafted, places a clear obligation on medical practitioners to ascertain whether it is possible to deliver the unborn, or indeed take other measures, that would enable the foetus to be brought to the point of viability before the pregnancy was ended in order to safe the mother's life.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendments proposed.<\/p><p>  I will deal with the second theme, that of viability, in this group of amendments under amendments Nos. 20, 22, 27, 28 and 41.  Again as I pointed out previously, the Bill makes reference to a medical practitioner's reasonable opinion in this regard, which places a statutory duty on each medical practitioner required to form an opinion for the purposes of the legislation to have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  This imposes a clear duty on medical practitioners to make every effort to preserve the life of a foetus.  Not to do so would mean a medical practitioner would be in breach of the proposed legislation and subject to its penalties.<\/p><p>  I must point out that the purpose of the legislation is not to regulate obstetric procedures, which do not constitute termination of pregnancy, or to dictate practice of obstetrics.  Standard medical practice will provide appropriate mechanisms for assessments of both the woman and the unborn and it would not be appropriate to include this, or other details of medical treatments, in legislation.  Therefore I will not and cannot accept the amendments proposed.<\/p><p>  On some of the comments made earlier today, to which Senator Healy Eames alluded again, on the issue of pain, I have talked to a number of experts today, including my chief medical officer, and the thalamus which is a very important part in terms of pain experience, does not really develop until the 21st week.  As we mentioned earlier, none of the techniques described by Senator Walsh are used.  Medical induction of labour and delivery is what is used after the 12th week.  There is no instrumental termination used after 12 weeks.  It would be considered to be far too dangerous for the life of the woman. <\/p> <p>Consequently, while the Senator has some information indicating some possibilities of pain being experienced by a foetus of 17 weeks plus, I would be grateful to have sight of that research and to hand it on to the medical people concerned.  As I stated earlier, at all times, care and compassion in respect of safety and as much pain control as possible is what is used in all procedures in hospitals from the point of view of all patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800048#ZZ00500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374165300,"counter":873,"content":"<p>On the pain issue, I am grateful for the Minister's answer.

I must make a small correction to amendment No. 22, which should read as:<blockquote>In page 9, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:&#8220;(5) Where the medical practitioner believes in his or her reasonable opinion that the unborn child is capable of surviving outside the womb with appropriate medical support, that that medical practitioner, where practicable, shall deliver the unborn and take all necessary measures to sustain the life of the born infant.&quot;.<\/blockquote>This is instead of the wording, &quot;sustain the life of the unborn infant&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800049#AAA00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374165300,"counter":874,"content":"<p>Senator, are you proposing to make a change to the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800049#AAA00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374165300,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Yes, if I could just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800049#AAA00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1374165300,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Senator, you cannot do it on this Stage but must do it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800049#AAA00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374165300,"counter":877,"content":"<p>Okay, then I will leave it as it is, because the meaning is fully clear.

However, the wording of the Bill will remain in the Act.  The refusal to accept this amendment during the D&aacute;il debate is extremely troubling and is completely at odds with the Minister's comments regarding delivering the baby at the cusp of viability.

I certainly anticipate there will be further debate on this subject on Report Stage.  It is noteworthy that the issue did not arise until the Seanad raised it.  It also is noteworthy that despite being the subject of amendments of which the Minister and his team would have been aware, the information was not available to the Minister this morning.  While I thank him for going to the trouble of finding out what he did, I do not believe it disposes fully of all the issues because thus far, the Bill is silent as to what may happen or, more to the point, what may not happen to a child who has arrived at the state of viability.<\/p><p>  I seek clarification from the Minister on an issue that has confused me but perhaps can be cleared up.  I believe the Minister himself mentioned this in the D&aacute;il in the context of a section 9 abortion or procedure when he stated there would be no question of waiting until the child could be delivered safely because he would not have it on his conscience that a person with suicidal ideation might endanger her life.  As the Minister is leaving the Chamber and will not be present to respond to it, I will postpone this question until he returns.<\/p><p>  My amendments in this group are amendments Nos. 17, 26, 36 and 55, which basically provide a definition of reasonable opinion, &quot;being an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn, and which has regard to the duty to deliver the viable unborn alive where practicable&quot;.  The Minister stated the words &quot;as far as practicable&quot; are taken directly from Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>.  That much is true but they are taken in a different context and in a different way from which they are used in Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, because what must be done, as far as practicable in this Bill, is to have &quot;regard to the need to preserve unborn human life&quot;, whereas in Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, it is &quot;to defend and vindicate&quot; that life, as far as practicable.  The express language of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup> is absent from the current Bill, which instead defines reasonable opinion as including &quot;regard to the need to preserve unborn life as far as practicable&quot;.  There is no mention whatsoever of the equal right to life of the unborn or of respecting, vindicating or defending that right.  The Bill merely requires that regard be had to the need to preserve unborn human life, a need immediately qualified through the addition of the clause &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  Yet, the constitutional guarantee in Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup> that laws respect the right to life of the unborn is not qualified in any way.  Furthermore, a need to &quot;preserve... life&quot; is a much more amorphous and much less legally established concept than a full-blown constitutional right to life.  Consequently, the Bill grants a lesser level of respect to the equal right to life of the unborn than does Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, which I believe to be a significant question hanging over this Bill from the perspective of the Constitution.<\/p><p>  There is a further equivocation in the Bill regarding the equal right to life of the unborn in that the aforementioned reasonable opinion is not a reasonable opportunity at all, because it merely requires an opinion formed in good faith.  Consequently, the Bill requires a significantly lower standard of mental element than that of an objective reasonable opinion, which in turn greatly undermines the supposed safeguards offered by section 9, as well as the criminal provisions of section 22.  Since the medical opinion need not take heed of relevant medical evidence in ordinary practice, the good faith test also is out of touch with the development of the tort of medical negligence from Dunne <i>v<\/i>. National Maternity Hospital onwards, as I noted previously.  It should also be noted that the entirety of the medical evaluation adheres to a good faith standard, including certification of a real and substantial risk to the woman's life.  Further, and perhaps crucially, whether due regard is had to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable is, according to the Bill, entirely a matter of subjective good faith.  I cannot discern how anyone could reconcile the Bill's provisions with the constitutional duty for laws to respect the equal right to life of the unborn, a duty that is framed in a categorically objective manner.  The subjective good faith standard pervading the Bill's provisions for medical assessments reflects the subjective grounds of suicidal ideation upon which the Bill provides for abortion.  Consequently, in the complete absence of empirical evidence that abortion makes women less suicidal, this Bill does not require that a medical opinion sanctioning an abortion on this very basis be based on anything more concrete than a subjective opinion.<\/p><p>  Further, the good faith test does not incorporate a duty to deliver a viable child from the womb alive.  In other words, a reasonable opinion required, as in the Bill, imposes no duty to ensure that where practicable, a viable child should be delivered alive, rather than aborted.  This will not really affect the operation of sections 7 and 8, which pertain to necessary interventions in cases of physical illness and a mother in that position will want everything done for herself and for her child.<\/p> <p>In practice, and as a matter of law, the Bill permits a section 9 medical procedure to effortlessly subordinate the need to preserve unborn human life to the statutory right to abort that child even where the preservation of unborn life is achievable as a matter of routine medical practice.  It is extremely difficult to equate all this with a guarantee to respect the equal right to life of the unborn, especially since it may, in fact, incentivise a medical practitioner to opt for an abortion instead of an early inducement so as to avoid questions over civil liability on foot of the disablement of a child, as we stated earlier.<\/p><p> Sections 7 to 9, inclusive, and 13 continue to permit a termination of pregnancy to be carried out up to and including delivery and in a manner that ends the life of the unborn at a stage in its development where, if that termination was to be carried out otherwise, the unborn would be capable of surviving.  Reasonable opinion can be anything but reasonable under this Bill provided it is formed in good faith.  This Bill does not leave the normal meaning of reasonable in place.  It tells us what a reasonable opinion is and it does not include the word &quot;reasonable&quot;.  The courts will have to go on whether it is in good faith and as I stated earlier, it is extremely difficult to prove <i>mala fides<\/i>.<\/p><p> The definition of &quot;reasonable opinion&quot; in the sections here, sections 7 to 9, inclusive, and 13, involves giving a purely artificial meaning to the term and provides for a subjective rather an objective test.  The current definition will make the reasonableness or otherwise of the opinion completely irrelevant, and this surprising result is achieved by giving the term a definition that has nothing to do with the ordinary meaning of the word &quot;reasonable&quot;.<\/p><p> This has major implications for the operation of section 7 - risk of loss of life from physical illness - section 8 but, particularly, sections 9 and 13, as it governs the second opinion that must be formed in those sections, that is, that the risk of the loss of life can only be averted by carrying out that medical procedure - that is the second opinion in the sense of the second issue to be decided.  It is a classic example of the Legislature turning the meaning of ordinary words on their head and case law confirms the right of the Legislature to do just that.  By juxtaposing the word &quot;reasonable&quot; with the word &quot;opinion&quot; in the term defined, the unsuspecting reader is seduced into believing that the term &quot;reasonable opinion&quot; must be based on reasonable grounds but nothing could be further from the truth.  On a close examination of the precise wording of the definition, it becomes clear that the opinion in question, that is, that the risk of loss of the woman's life &quot;can only be averted by carrying out the medical procedure&quot;, must only be formed in good faith - an entirely subjective test.  There is no onus whatsoever on the medical practitioner, when forming his or her reasonable opinion, to base that opinion on reasonable grounds.<\/p><p> On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated:<blockquote>To be clear, it will only allow a pregnancy to be terminated in circumstances where it is expected that the woman will otherwise die.  It has been suggested that the legislation should include a clear provision to that effect and also an explicit reference to viability.  I reassure all Deputies that, as currently drafted, the Bill prohibits the killing of a viable foetus.<br \/><br \/> As previously stated, the Bill makes reference to a medical practitioner's reasonable opinion.  This places a statutory duty on each medical practitioner required to form such an opinion for the purpose of legislation to have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  This imposes a clear duty on medical practitioners to make every effort to preserve the life of a foetus that may be viable.  The amendments to sections 7 to 9, inclusive, and 13 would express this in the body of the Bill. Sections 7 to 9, inclusive, are structured in such a way as to provide for a balancing of the rights of the unborn and those of a pregnant woman.<\/blockquote>Against what the Minister stated, there is nothing in the Bill to support his contention that it, specifically, in the context of section 9 which is where the controversy is, prohibits the killing of a viable foetus.  There is nothing in the Bill to support that contention.<\/p><p> The Minister supports his viewpoint with reference to reasonable opinion but there are a number of problems.  First, as currently drafted, the Bill only protects those procedures that will end the life of the unborn.<\/p><p> Second, reasonable opinion requires that the relevant opinion, it should be remembered, a good-faith opinion, has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable, and that last clause is the crucial one.  A woman who seeks a section 9 certification almost certainly does so on account of the child's existence, not simply because she is physiologically pregnant.  As such a medical procedure that does not involve ending the life of the unborn, whether viable or otherwise, is not a procedure that averts the real and substantial risk to the woman's life by way of suicide and, in a double sense, it is not a procedure protected and clarified by the Bill.  To be an efficacious and legally protected procedure under the Bill's provisions, it necessarily must involve the death of the unborn.<\/p><p> Third, all this helps make clear how redundant the phrase, &quot;have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable&quot;, really is.  It adds nothing of substance to the Bill.  One must remember it is at the certification stage that such is required; it does not affect what the practitioner does.  The practitioner is protected in carrying out a procedure that ends the life of the child.  There is no good reason, finally, to refuse an amendment clarifying that a viable child, under section 9, will not be aborted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800049#AAA02000","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374165900,"counter":893,"content":"<p>I listened to what the Minister, Deputy Reilly has to say with regard to the wording of the amendment.

I understand that at an earlier stage, the heads of Bill stage, the original proposal was that it would be capable of being carried out by a registered medical practitioner at an appropriate location.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify that for me and maybe, for the benefit of the House, explain the reason for the change.<\/p> <p>My amendment proposes that the medical procedure be carried out by an obstetrician or &quot;medical practitioner of another relevant specialty, not being a psychiatrist&quot;.  Obviously, the explicit exclusion of psychiatrists would be necessary to ensure there would be no ambiguity permitting the interpretation of the section to include suicidal ideation as a physical illness.<\/p><p> During the course of the Oireachtas health committee hearings, written and oral submissions were made by both medical and legal experts to the effect that head 2(1) was deficient in restricting the carrying out of the medical procedures in question to public obstetric units.  It was pointed out that these life-saving medical procedures might need to be carried out at a general hospital where the patient might, at the time, be under the care of another medical specialist, such as an oncologist.  In an apparent response to those submissions - I realise section 7 provides for the change - an appropriate institution is defined in the Bill as essentially any public general hospital and any further institution specified by the Minister.  My issue relates to the change from &quot;registered medical practitioner&quot; to &quot;obstetrician&quot;.  It will be noted that not only has the location at which a medical procedure may be carried out been changed in the implementation of head 2(1) by section 7 of the Bill but also that the qualification of person by whom it may be carried out has been changed.  Head 2 specifies that any registered medical practitioner may carry out the relevant life-saving medical procedure, but section 7 states only an obstetrician may carry out the procedure.<\/p><p> Is a relevant medical specialist who is not an obstetrician permitted to carry out a life-saving medical procedure?  I have asked Senator Crown about this and he agrees - I do not want to put words in his mouth - that there may be a lacuna that ought to be addressed.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about it.  What about the case of a cancer patient in a general hospital under the care of an oncologist who wishes to prescribe or administer a medical procedure such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy in the course of which or as a result of which the pregnant woman will be at risk of losing her unborn child?  If the oncologist proceeds and the unborn child dies in the course of or as a result of the medical procedure prescribed or administered, or is perhaps stillborn, will the oncologist have any protection from the law under section 7?<\/p><p> We all know what we would like to see happen.  Good medical practice in the State has always distinguished between direct and indirect effect.  It is well-established and universally accepted that good medical practice, as in cancer care, may sometimes result in the undesired death of the unborn child.  Our doctors are very good at managing the care of patients in consultation with them and ensuring that care is given in a way that is least noxious to the unborn child.  However, it is not always possible to save an unborn child or to prevent danger, damage or death to the unborn child when a pregnant woman needs necessary medical treatment.<\/p><p> Under this legislation, irrespective of what anybody else says we will have a new law stipulating it is an offence to destroy unborn human life intentionally.  In the law, one is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of one's actions.  It is a rebuttable presumption.  A person who may foresee the death of a child as a result of necessary medical treatment, such as cancer treatment, might feel vulnerable in such circumstances.  What is lawful is the carrying out of a medical procedure in the course of which, or as a result of which - indirect effect would seem to be provided for - an unborn life is ended, but a procedure rendered lawful by this Bill, which does not mention abortion but which criminalises the intentional destruction of unborn life, is one that can be carried out only by an obstetrician.  There may be other examples that I do not know about.  Perhaps the Minister of State has examined this and can assist us.  Are practitioners other than obstetricians who are in the business of providing necessary life-saving medical treatment covered by this Bill when they have to carry out a medically sound procedure, in good faith, but which has the foreseeable effect of taking the life of the unborn?<\/p><p> This is far from an academic matter because the case of C in the case of A, B and C <i>v.<\/i>Ireland in the European Court of Human Rights involved a person in remission from cancer when she became pregnant.  Is it possible that this Bill, which is intended to offer her or somebody in a similar position adequate clarity and protection, does not offer that?  Could it be that section 7, as currently drafted, would have the effect of putting women's lives at risk?  I do not ask this in any declamatory fashion but I am seeking clarification for the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800050#BBB01100","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374166500,"counter":904,"content":"<p>The Senator is moving away from amendment No. 19, which is specific.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800051#CCC00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374166500,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I am not.

Medics are softly pressurised - and hopefully we will get to the conscience stage because it will come up as well - by people who come from a different disposition.

If I heard it once, I must have heard it a hundred times from Government spokespersons.  I cannot remember if the Minister of State, Deputy White, said it, but I would be surprised if he did not.  Part of the background to all this was a criticism by the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy that we had failed to legislate.  The criticism was made in the X case.  Now, the Government is failing to legislate again.  It is putting in place legislation which changes the pitch.  It establishes the tone and also the rules while omitting the question of what a doctor ought to do in circumstances where a child is at viability and may be saved.  The certifying psychiatrist and obstetrician, who may or may not be the person required to carry out the procedure, are only required to have regard to the need to preserve the life of the child as far as practicable.  They have to have regard to that while making a decision on certification in subjective good faith.  The person who carries out the procedure is governed by the law which says it shall be lawful to carry out a medical procedure in the course of which, or as a result of which, an unborn human life is ended.  The silence on giving comfort to a doctor that he or she might lawfully carry out a procedure where the life of the child might not be ended is just as bad as any failure to legislate.<\/p><p>In the context of legislation, we have a lacuna.  In one way, the lacuna serves not to protect the doctor who might want to act.  The failure to impose a duty to protect the child who is at viability gives comfort to the type of doctor, who may exist, who may have an ideology or to a careless doctor of the type who end up in front of the fitness to practice committee of the Medical Council.  The Minister said earlier that he would not proceed on the basis that doctors would not act well.  The whole point of law is to ensure that one does not depend on the good intentions and best practice of 100% of any population, be it the citizenry, medics or legal professionals.  We must, therefore, ask the Minister to proceed on the basis that there might be people out there who do not have the best interests of unborn children at heart.

It concerns the risk of loss of life through suicide.  I want to correct matters because I may have been misunderstood earlier in respect of the way I presented my points.  We wandered into the section on suicide by accident and came out of it.  What I am saying here is that everyone agrees, and psychiatrists have clearly put it on the record, that they are really good at assessing pregnant women at risk of suicide but that they are really poor at predicting suicide.  In fact, up to 15% of women express suicidal feelings but may not go on to take their lives.  Psychiatrists have been very clear that while they are skilled at identifying patients at high risk of suicide, even in the high-risk group, they are likely to predict incorrectly 97 times out of 100.<\/p><p>  As there is no reliable body of evidence that access to abortion reduces suicide rates or improves women's mental health, it is not possible to develop clinical practice guidelines based on medical evidence to clarify where it is justifiable to certify a woman as eligible for abortion.  The Oireachtas was informed that none of the three consultant perinatal psychiatrists in Ireland, in their collective experience of 40 years, had seen a woman for whom termination of pregnancy was the only suitable treatment.  In the context of this, 113 psychiatrists produced a statement explaining and outlining their huge difficulty with the notion that abortion was a suitable treatment for suicidal feelings or intent.  That is where this care pathway is coming from.  <\/p><p>  Before I look at the exact wording of the care pathway, I would like to share with the House an e-mail I received from a young woman only two days ago.  She asked me to share this story with the House because she had an abortion for mental health reasons.<\/p> <p>Here are her words:<blockquote><br \/>I remember going into the theatre hoping that the [doctor] would ask me would I like to change my mind but he never did.  Straight afterwards, not only was the life and soul of my child suctioned out of me but a crucial part of me had died as well.<br \/><br \/> I felt it [deeply].  It was a feeling that I could not shake off and hence I used prescription medications daily and weekend binge drinking to numb and block out the horror of killing my baby.  I desperately tried to forget what I did and tried to convince myself that it was the best decision.  I slowly [turned] from being a caring nurse into an impatient and sometimes cold and cynical nurse.  I became withdrawn and depressed and at times I entertained suicidal thoughts after the abortion as this brought hope to me, because my life was not worth living, I was just existing.  I worked extremely hard maybe 60 to 70 hours a week, a lot of night shifts.  This has been the worst decision of my life.<br \/><br \/> I implore of you and your colleagues to appreciate your privileged position to be aware that your elected post has not been by chance and that you are in this role at this time and that the fate of the unborn is now in your hands and you are in a position of power to choose life or death.<\/blockquote>This young woman clearly states the critical role of the doctor, who at that moment might have been able to change her mind.  She is also explaining that she is under incredible pressure.  This is why this care pathway is so critical.  I know many people have much to say on this.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 30 states:<blockquote>In page 10, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:<blockquote><b>&quot;9. <\/b>(1) Any pregnant woman who presents as suicidal at her general practitioner or at an accident and emergency department shall be entitled to a Care Pathway which shall comprise the following steps--<br \/>(a) a full psychiatric assessment and an assessment of capacity within two hours of presenting at her general practitioner or at an accident or emergency department,<br \/>(b) a suicide prevention algorithm shall be formulated by the psychiatrist to assess the need for hospital admission, day hospital care or care at home as appropriate,<br \/>(c) a full psycho-social assessment of her needs shall take place within 24 hours of presenting at her general practitioner or at an accident or emergency department,<br \/>(d) an integrated multi-disciplinary care plan for the woman will be formulated between the psychiatrist, an obstetrician (if she is already under the care of an obstetrician), her general practitioner, a social worker, and her family,<br \/>(e) if the woman is still expressing suicidal ideation, she shall be entitled to focused therapy which, based on the evidence, should include dialectical behaviour therapy, in her home if necessary,<br \/>(f) day hospital care, and\/or pharmacological treatments will be concurrently made available within 24 hours of the request for same, depending on need,<br \/>(g) the psychiatrist shall evaluate the woman twice weekly during the crisis stage of her treatment and thereafter depending on the consideration of the psychiatrist and the perspective of the woman and her family, based on clinical need,<br \/>(h) thereafter the woman's interdisciplinary care team will meet at least once in every 14 days to assess her progress.&quot;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>The underlying intention here is to provide care for someone who is expressing suicidal feelings in pregnancy and is carrying another life.  There is a great intention here of the very best care for mother and child.  The psychiatrists who have proposed this have requested that this would be designed by the college of psychiatry.  How could we wish against this?  It is wholesome, holistic and caring.  It proposes to give life every chance and mind the woman whose life may be at risk.  I ask the Minister of State to strongly consider accepting the amendment on the basis of the previous testimony I have presented from just one young woman who had to have an abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800055#GGG02100","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374169500,"counter":996,"content":"<p>I am speaking on my amendment No. 40.  In tabling the amendment I was motivated by evidence from the United States where in several states abortion clinics have a legal obligation that a pregnant woman presenting herself for an abortion is shown a scan of the unborn baby prior to any procedure being carried out.  I am grateful to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill who gave me a statistic based on evidence that in 90% of such cases, the pregnant woman changed her mind and the baby was saved.  My sole motivation in drafting this amendment was in the hope that at the very latest stage of the process under which section 9 operates, a life could be saved and in fact the two lives could be saved.<\/p><p>However, I have further reflected and spoken to a large number of women because I believed women could give an insight into the matter.  I have no wish nor was it ever my intention to inflict any further emotional or psychological pain on an already distressed mentally ill pregnant woman, who has gone through the legal processes, has been reviewed and assessed by a team of psychiatrists and an obstetrician, has arrived at the point of certification, and is at the institution where the procedure is to be carried out.  I would not wish for one second to add in any way to the distress that is obviously there anyway.  For that reason I will more than likely withdraw the amendment.

Senator Healy Eames has spoken very eloquently and I will not speak for very long.  I was particularly taken by Senator Mooney's proposed amendment and it is a matter for him as to whether he presses it.<\/p><p>  Good care for a mother should always be and by definition has to be completely compatible with good care for her unborn child.  Our understanding of caring based on everything we have heard and learned through this long process is that women are not well served by abortion.  As we know from the famous but perhaps not sufficiently discussed Ferguson studies, abortion is not associated with any improved mental health outcomes for women and is associated with a low to moderate risk of negative mental health <i>sequelae<\/i> for women.  That is not just in the case of women with prior mental health issues but it is a more general proposition.<\/p><p>  During the committee hearings we heard and the Minister has pointed out that it would be impossible to do a specific study of women presenting as suicidal and requesting an abortion that would distinguish between those who were given it and those who were not.  The drift of knowledge in this area is to associate abortion with negative rather than positive mental health outcomes.  It would therefore seem entirely appropriate that, in the context of a caring protective engagement between any woman and her medical expert, guide and carer, the possibility of negative mental health outcomes associated with abortion would be canvassed in truth - that is called informed consent.<\/p><p>  If in that context and in an appropriate way some reflection on the reality of the unborn child were suggested, that would seem entirely compatible with good care for both the woman and the child.  We need to bear in mind as we have been constantly told there is a constitutional architecture that refers to the equal right to life of the unborn and also bearing in mind what the legislation we are told requires which is the formation of a reasonable opinion that the risk to life brought about by the threat of suicide and suicidal ideation can only be averted by carrying out the medical procedure.<\/p> <p>In an ideal world of the kind where there are only good doctors and pregnancy counsellors - we are being invited to believe such a world exists - no abortions would be carried out under section 9 because, by definition, one would not have to be a psychiatrist to conclude that abortion could not be the only means by which the risk of suicide could be averted in view of the fact that there would always be a possibility that the person involved, by an act of will, would opt against abortion.  In that sense, it could always be truthfully stated that abortion could not be the only way to avert the risk.  This would apply in the circumstances to which I refer in a way in which it would never apply to section 7 or section 8 procedures because there is an objective risk to life which could only be remediated by medical intervention.<\/p><p>We live in the real world and we all know what section 9 means.  We also know how difficult it is for psychiatrists to make decisions in respect of this matter.  There are no experts present but I heard Senator Gilroy's comments and I respect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800056#HHH00300","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374170100,"counter":999,"content":"<p>I stated that I am not an expert.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800057#JJJ00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1374170100,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>I am giving the Senator credit, not criticising him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800057#JJJ00300","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374170100,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>Which is strange.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800057#JJJ00400","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1374170100,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>The Senator should not jump all over me.  The joint committee heard from the experts and Professor Kevin Malone, a suicide prevention expert, was extremely concerned with regard to the impact this would have, not just on women but on young men, particularly in the context of their mental health.  Approximately 113 psychiatrists signed a statement indicating that they believe they are being wrongly drawn into a process which they do not regard as medical.  Dr. John Sheehan, a perinatal psychiatrist, stated that under the legislation, psychiatrists are being asked to be the gatekeepers and that he could not predict what would be the outcome in this regard.<\/p><p>The joint committee also heard from other psychiatrists such as Dr. Anthony McCarthy who did not provide any reassurances in respect of numbers, other than the fact that he thought there would be very few.  Dr. McCarthy did not provide any understanding on this matter and he never highlighted any circumstances in which a psychiatrist might decline an abortion on the grounds of suicide.  It must be remembered that one is always rightly supposed to believe someone who states that he or she is suicidal.  We were never really provided with an explanation as to how we might extricate ourselves from that morass.<\/p><p>For all of those reasons, I welcome Senator Healy Eames's amendment.  Amendment No. 34 in my name provides a much more abridged version of what is contained in amendment No. 30.  The basic point I am seeking to make with the amendment is that the good-faith standard contained in section 9 is extremely subjective and does not confer a duty upon psychiatrists to make a genuinely reasonable attempt to avert the risk of suicide by methods other than abortion.  As a result, amendment No. 34 proposes that an objectively reasonable attempt should be made to &quot;avert the risk of suicide via psychiatric treatment and\/or engaging the patient with psychotherapy or counselling services&quot;.  At an earlier point and in another context, the Minister stated that there would be a possibility of delaying a procedure where a child is on the cusp of viability.  It seems, therefore, that there ought to be time to do this.<\/p><p>I also know what was stated in this Chamber by Dr. Maria Cahill during the joint committee's hearings in respect of the judgment in the Cosma case.  The argument Dr. Cahill put forward was not, in my view, effectively rebutted by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In its judgment relating to that case, the Supreme Court appeared to lay down a clarification on how the X-case test might be applied when a person presents as suicidal.  None of the Cosma case requirements has been imported into the legislation before us.<\/p><p>As already stated, amendment No. 34 refers to a reasonable attempt to &quot;avert the risk of suicide via psychiatric treatment and\/or engaging the patient with psychotherapy or counselling services&quot; and in that context I recognise that every case turns on the facts relating to it and on the experience of the particular patient involved.  The amendment also refers to the need for one of the medical practitioners involved to inform the woman of her &quot;legal right to place her unborn for adoption after birth&quot;.  During this debate, the idea of adoption has been almost completely neglected.  This amendment, if accepted, would place no onerous duty - everyone should note those words carefully - on medical practitioners and nor would it place any kind of obstacle in the path of a woman.  I am merely seeking here to defend and vindicate the right to life of the unborn by conferring a duty upon medical practitioners to consider all non-lethal means of avoiding a risk to the woman's life via suicide and to inform her of her rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800057#JJJ00500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374170100,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>In political and ideological terms, this issue lies at the core of the legislation we are proposing to pass.

Obviously, I do not have any of the legal qualifications of which the Minister of State is in possession.

Notwithstanding that fact, however, and if it were so disposed, the House could pass the legislation minus the suicide clause and defend itself fully for doing so in the Supreme Court on the basis of all of the medical and psychiatric evidence from across the globe that has become available in the 20 years since that court made its decision in the X case.

The Minister of State knows better than I - this is becoming one of the mantras used in this debate - that the clause in question will only apply where abortion is the only possible treatment.

Almost immediately, Ministers and people on the medical side reacted and claimed why it could not happen.  I am sorry that the Minister is not present.  Yesterday, he and I clashed - purely in a political way and no more - when I raised some of the interventions of Dr. Anthony McCarthy.  The Minister reminded me of how Dr. McCarthy had entirely dismissed this concept.  However, I would remind the Minister of what said gentlemen stated on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;.  I say this in the context of what the Minister of State's party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, charged us with this afternoon when she asked what price we were putting on women's health.  I agree with her, as I hope the Minister of State present does.  It should be priceless.  As a Government, a House and a nation, we should provide whatever money and services are required to look after women.<\/p><p> When Dr. McCarthy was asked whether he was dismissive of this amendment because it was somehow wrong, he replied that he was dismissive of it because it could not work and was &quot;totally impractical&quot;.  He stated:<blockquote>I would love it if it were practical [but] mental health services in Ireland ... have always been under-resourced and cut back.  The idea that, around the country from Dublin to Caherciveen to Drumshanbo, there would the availability in emergency departments of psychiatrists who would do comprehensive suicide assessments within two hours ... [when] we don't have them on call at weekends.<\/blockquote>Listening to that interview, I heard a gentleman clearly outline the problem facing us, that being, resources.  I ask colleagues, particularly my party colleagues, to reflect on this.  We claim that this suicide option - as I would call it, this abortion treatment for suicide - would only apply when all other prospective treatments had been exhausted.  However, a leading psychiatrist who some like to claim supports some of their arguments has put it firmly on the record that most of the so-called supports are not available.<\/p><p> As I stated on Second Stage, our ambition for the women and mothers of this country must be high, honourable and proud and contemplate more than just abortion.  Women in pregnancy who are suicidal need every possible support.  We should be willing to break the bank fiscally at budget time to live up to our responsibilities.

Are we claiming that suicide is any less of a risk than any other medical illness that a woman may have, for example, a heart problem?  This is the nub of the problem.

There are circumstances wherein a woman is suicidal and medical professionals have to make the judgment that a termination may be necessary.

It has happened in many instances.<\/p><p>  The most eminent expert on suicide in Ireland, and recognised internationally, is Professor Kevin Malone.  During the hearings, he told us that there was a real risk that legislating for the small number of women who commit suicide could have an adverse affect on women of child bearing age who are suicidal but not pregnant and also on young males.  Professor Malone stated that 2 in 1 million women in pregnancy and 350 in 1 million young males will commit suicide.  These are real and genuine concerns.  <\/p><p>  All of the psychiatrists who appeared before the hearings, some of whom were on the pro-choice side and others of whom were on the pro-life side, stated that there is no way of being accurate in predictions.  We were informed that a study in Britain found that of 100 people predicted to commit suicide 97% did not.  The expert advice is that any person who presents with suicidal ideation should be treated in accordance with best practice in the psychiatric field.  <\/p><p>  Another issue that arose towards the end of the debate, for which I am sure the Minister of State was present, is the presentation of women with suicidal intent who are mentally ill.  A psychiatrist assesses the predicament of women in this regard.  It was also stated by some experts that in their judgment the number of women who will present with suicidal intent and do not have a mental illness will be high and that because of our mental health legislation these women will be offered treatment but are entitled to refuse it.  Therefore, the only treatment remaining, if the woman requests it, will be the abortion she seeks.  This presents real dangers.  The experts believe the largest number of cases will be in this area.<\/p><p>  People have spoken about trusting women and so on.  While many groups with different perspectives took part in the hearings, it is a pity more people did not engage in the process.  One woman who has had an abortion was in touch with me yesterday to confirm what she said during the meeting in the AV Room.  The woman concerned is an Irish woman who was pregnant and in the British Army.  She was advised by people in the British forces who are senior to her that there would be adverse consequences of her not having an abortion and that it would affect her career.  Her boyfriend, who is also in the Army, was adamant that she should have the abortion.  When she sought advice, she was told that she should in her interest seek the abortion on the grounds of being suicidal because it would fast-track her abortion.  <\/p><p>  During the hearings I quoted at length from Bernard Nathanson's book, <i>Aborting America <\/i>(Double Day 1979).  It states that the supposed threat of suicide was the logical battering ram and, that &quot;It was a question of finding a squad of complacent psychiatrists&quot;.  Many people have written books on this issue.  We also met with Women Hurt who told of the advice they had been given in order to secure an abortion.  They told us that because of the pressure they were under, the distress they were in and their unwanted pregnancy they would have said or done anything to secure that abortion.  I believe them.  I have no reason not to.  I also have no reason to disbelieve that there will be other women in the future who will find themselves in similar positions and will take the same route.  <\/p><p>  The late Dr. Anthony Clare who was pro-choice at the time of the 1992 referendum supported the 2002 amendment to the Constitution, having changed his opinion.  He is on record as saying that suicide was the wedge through which liberal abortion regimes were introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800059#LLL00700","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374171300,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>That is a misquotation of Dr. Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800059#LLL00800","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1374171300,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>That is what he said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800059#LLL00900","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374171300,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>He said \"mental health\" not, \"suicide\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800059#LLL01000","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1374171300,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>Assuming this legislation is passed, we will need to be able to analyse the detail of why abortions are carried out here.

We are considering suicide risk.  Suicidal ideation is one element that is often but not always present in suicide risk.  It is as simple as that, mostly.  There are other clear markers for suicide risk, and it is only suicide risk that psychiatrists are being asked to analyse.  It has been said as recently as four minutes ago that there is no predictor, once suicide risk has been determined, that it will actually be carried out, but that it is not the intent of this Bill.  It clearly states that what we are looking at is risk - not prediction, not ideation, not a threat to health.  We are talking about a clear threat to life.  Surely I am missing something in the debate, as the point seems so obvious to me.  I cannot understand how it can be obscured with the arguments here.  It seems that some of the arguments have tied their proponents into certain positions that they cannot retreat from.  I am not pointing the finger at anybody.  I have said all along that I am not an expert, although I worked as a nurse in the area throughout my career.<\/p><p>  Those who say they are able to support sections 7 and 8 but are unable to support section 9 are drawing a distinction between our response to medical emergencies on one side and psychiatric emergencies on the other.  It is a false dichotomy which denies the reality that these are equal risks.  A heart attack can be diagnosed and if untreated it can lead to death, but suicidal risk, if untreated, can also result in death.  Both are equal emergencies, so I cannot understand how we can support sections 7 and 8 and not support section 9.<\/p><p>  I will speak on amendment No. 30.  Although it may appear reasonable at first glance, there is no way this could be incorporated into the law of the land.  The idea is for a full psychiatric assessment and assessment of capacity within two hours of admission, but a first year student nurse can tell us that a proper risk assessment takes several days.  There is no possible way we could have a proper, comprehensive and accurate risk assessment in two hours.<\/p><p>  I presume the reference to a &quot;suicide prevention algorithm&quot; refers to a strategy which can be formed by a psychiatrist to assess the need for hospital admission, day hospital care or care at home as appropriate.  This is a key element.  What if somebody presents with a risk of suicide without a mental illness or a diagnosable mental disorder, which is required under section 7 of the Mental Health Act?  A diagnostic tool is the WHO's <i>ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders<\/i>, of which chapter V lists all diagnosable mental disorders, one of which must be present for involuntary detention of anybody in any of our psychiatric hospitals.  If somebody who has been adjudicated as having a risk of suicidal ideation - which is not a mental disorder, according to the terms of the Mental Health Act - is pregnant and presents to a hospital, or, more likely, is brought by garda&iacute;, do we have the power to detain them?  Should we change the section of the Mental Health Act that offers protection against unlawful detention in a psychiatric facility, which we have seen much abused even in my own time?  In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, our psychiatric hospitals were places to incarcerate people rather than treat them.  One section of the Mental Health Act dealing with diagnosable mental disorders offers protection against that, so are we now looking to repeal that section?  The logic of the argument for the amendment means we must do so.  There is another type of logic which would create a position that is unbelievable or even farcical.  The only other option we have is to reclassify pregnancy as a mental disorder.  These are the only two options we have.  How stupid does that sound?  It sounds appallingly farcical.<\/p><p>  If a person does not wish to avail of treatment for suicidality - if there is treatment at all, and I do not think there is - there is no pathway.

Having attended the six days of the hearings, I can say there was contrary opinion.  This suggestion that everybody agreed is regrettable.  There was contrary opinion, as I pointed out in my speech on Second Stage.  We should be very careful about making sweeping statements.<\/p><p>In regard to the amendments, Members have questioned why we are doing this.  Article 40.3.3&deg; states that the State &quot;guarantees in its laws&quot;.  We do not always uphold our constitutional obligations in our laws, but we must and I believe we must do so clearly for the X case.  The Cosma case was raised, which surprised me.  It was said that the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, did not deal with it effectively, but I watched it in the D&aacute;il.  During the committee hearings, however, a senior counsel and a former Supreme Court judge dismissed that.  I do not need to study law to know that a High Court ruling on an asylum case does not gazump - I do not have the legal terminology - a Supreme Court ruling.  I do not need to study law to know it is the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>The issue here is suicide in pregnancy.  I spoke on this on Second Stage and I will not repeat what I said as I am conscious that other Members wish to speak.  However, I have a difficulty with this section because we are separating it from section 7.  This is about risk to life.  Throughout this debate I have had the feeling - and &quot;feeling&quot; is the right word - that this is about a woman who has certain feelings or thoughts.  That is not what we are talking about.  We were given some very real examples at the committee hearings.  We heard about the woman who is anorexic and wants to get rid of the pregnancy.  She had taken three overdoses.  This is not somebody who has gone to a psychiatrist and said she was not feeling great.  We also heard about the woman who is pregnant due to incestuous abuse and about the growth inside her.  We heard about the woman who is in an abusive relationship.  There are reports which show that when women in an abusive relationship get pregnant, the violence very often escalates.  We heard about a woman being kicked repeatedly in the stomach.  She did not want this for her child and wanted to kill herself.  This is not about a woman who has this idea to circumvent the law.  That woman is on the aeroplane and is gone.  This is about a risk to life.  There are very rare cases, and the wording deals with that.<\/p><p>People talk about clinical markers.  How do we commit people involuntarily if there are no markers or no way to diagnose?  How do the doctors make that decision?  It is a medical practice.  There is an idea that mental health is not medical.  Physical and mental health are interlinked.<\/p><p>I will conclude because I am conscious that other Members wish to speak.  As we clearly heard at the committee hearings from obstetricians and many of the psychiatrists, they will always work towards saving both lives.

That is very regrettable.<\/p><p>I shall try to speak to the amendment at hand.  Again, we have heard a great deal about evidence-based medicine and the fact there is no evidence basis in medicine, allegedly, for abortion ever being a treatment for a pregnant woman with suicidal intent.  I hasten to add, and some of my colleagues have touched on the matter, evidence-based medicine is not something that is decided by legislators.  Evidence-based medicine is decided by teams and panels of health care professionals and clinicians after synthesising the data and breached guidelines.  Some evidence-based medicine comes from a very high level of evidence derived from large randomised trials.  The default position when such evidence is not available is that the best evidence available is the evidence which there is and it may be anecdotal.<\/p><p>The other critical matter about evidence-based medicine is that it is not immutable, it changes.  As I pointed out earlier, there are things that I do now that I did not do one month ago.  There are things that I did one month ago that I have stopped doing now.  It is not because a legislator told me what I should or should not do but because the evidence has evolved.  We are in the a situation where if, in theory, there is no evidence-based medicine for ever - and I mean ever - doing an abortion on a suicidal woman in an attempt to prevent her going through with self-harm it will not happen.  One will not get three doctors to agree to do this if they follow evidence-based medicine.  Clearly, the subtext here is that there will be deliberate malfeasance by doctors in collusion with malfeasant women. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800062#OOO00600","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1374173100,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800062#OOO00700","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1374173100,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>No other interpretation can be put forward for this fear that a non evidence-based practice will become widely pursued other than the fact that doctors, uniquely in this circumstance, will suspend their sense of obligation and rigour in interpreting data.  We are not talking about doctors flown in to some little fly by night clinic.  We are talking about people who are consultants.  Trust me, I have said often enough in here that one of the several strengths in our mediocre health system is the people who work in it.  We have the best trained nurses and doctors in the world.  At senior consultant level in all of the specialties we have an unbelievable winnowing process and only people who have gone through an extraordinary level of selection get to a position where he or she can make decisions.  We need to trust them.<\/p><p>What then is the problem?  As Senator Gilroy has pointed out, maternal death is extraordinarily rare in all western countries.  I stand to be corrected on the following.  There have been years in Ireland, and during the ones that I have been here, when there were no maternal deaths in the whole country.  None.  It is impossible to make the kind of statistical assumptions one needs to make to define an evidence basis for a procedure like this.  We have clear evidence - I am sorry but I have tried to stay away from the sad case of Savita Halappanavar and I understand the nuance of the multiple factors that contributed to her tragic death.  However, one thing must be said.  It was partly an attempt by politicians, judges etc. to give an opinion on what would be the right medical care meant that led to a group of doctors who, I believe,  would otherwise have interpreted what would have been the evidence basis feeling constrained from doing so.  On the Monday of that poor lady's illness I believe that most doctors, in most parts of the world, would have said she someone who was having an inevitable miscarriage, that the pregnancy could not survive, that the foetus or baby and her precious first born baby would be dead within a matter of hours or days because it could not be saved when the cervix was dilating.  I do not want to go into all of the details but Members will know what I mean.  It could not have been stopped.  The decision was not made to do the manoeuvre which might have resulted in a lesser risk of a potentially fatal infection for her.  The understanding of the doctors, on the basis of the legal ambiguity in which they worked, was that they might be breaking the law.  That was that, clear and simple.  I am not saying that was the only reason.  I ask all of those who have told us about evidence-based medicine to please understand that if the doctors had been left alone to practise evidence-based medicine without the fear that was imposed on them by medical amateurs, through a faulty legislative process, the situation may well have been avoided.<\/p><p>I must saying something else because I do not believe that I will get a chance to say it later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800062#OOO00800","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1374173100,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>We can only deal with the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800062#OOO00900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374173100,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>With the greatest of respect for my dear friend and colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, whose absolute sincerity on this issue I appreciate, I am delighted that he will withdraw his amendment.

I am delighted that, wisely and humanely, Senator Mooney took counsel on this matter and decided to withdraw the amendment.<\/p><p>No one who supports the Bill, which includes the suicide clause, claims that doctors must consider abortion as a treatment for suicide.  Rather, it is saying that if the evidence base at the time the decision must be made &ndash; evidence bases change - suggests that it may be appropriate, the doctor will not face prosecution.  The only logical reason that people of good faith could be opposed to the Bill was if they believed that it was a licence for deliberate malfeasance.  It is on this question that those who oppose the inclusion of the suicide provision need to say whether they believe that women will lie and not one but a whole panel of doctors will collectively and unprecedentedly suspend every critical faculty they have and make the wrong decision for reasons that are wholly malfeasant, not based on their training and clinical evidence.<\/p><p>Various people who have spoken on the Bill have been quoted repeatedly.

T&aacute; aif&eacute;ala orm &eacute; a choinne&aacute;il &oacute; Shligeach.  I apologise for keeping the Minister of State away from Sligo.<\/p><p>I raise an issue that was brought to my attention recently.  The Official Languages Act, which has been in place since 2003, places obligations on semi-State bodies and Departments to introduce language schemes to ensure that citizens who wish to conduct business through the medium of Irish can do so.  The 650 bodies covered by the Act include larger organisations such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, Departments, local authorities and so forth and smaller entities such as the Leader companies and the organisation for the registration of co-operatives, etc.  The process to be followed is that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht must write to each of the organisations covered by the Act requesting that it implement a language scheme.  Once a scheme has been drawn up by the relevant body, it is submitted to the Department for ratification.  Once ratified, the Language Commissioner may then proceed to police the scheme, as it were.<\/p><p>This Official Languages Act is important legislation for those who try to do their work through the medium of Irish.  It has become clear, however, that there is a significant deficit in the number of bodies which have implemented a scheme.  At this point, the Minister has ratified 95 schemes covering 181 public bodies, which means more than 450 organisations have not yet been asked to submit a draft scheme since 2003.  Some of the bodies concerned are large, and include the Health Service Executive, RTE and An Post, with which people interact As Gaeilge on a daily basis, and two Departments, namely, An Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe agus An Roinn Leana&iacute; agus Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; &Oacute;ige Phoibl&iacute;.  <\/p><p>It has been more than seven years since some organisations were asked to submit a draft scheme.  It is shocking to learn that of the 95 schemes ratified to date, 71 are out of date, some for three, four and five years.  To summarise the position, of the more than 650 public bodies in the State, 450 have not been asked to draft an Irish language scheme and of the 95 language schemes ratified by the Department, 71 or 75% are out of date.  If such disregard were to be shown for any other Act, there would be a national outcry. <\/p><p>Strange as it may seem, the specific issue I raise tonight was brought to my attention by a person who has investments with the National Treasury Management Agency, which falls within the remit of the Act.  The individual in question has tried to conduct some business with the NTMA.  From what I can discern, the Department has not asked the agency to produce a draft Irish language scheme.  When does the Minister intend writing to the NTMA requesting that it draft a scheme?  When does he expect such a scheme to be ratified and when will ordinary citizens be able to interact as Gaeilge with this State sponsored body?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800064#QQQ00800","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1374174000,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh for the opportunity to address the Seanad on the subject of the Official Languages Act 2003.  I express my gratitude to Senators for the interest they have shown in this matter.<\/p><p>The Official Languages Act was signed into law on 14 July 2003.  This was the first time that the provision of State services in general through Irish was placed on a statutory footing.  The aim of the Act is to increase and improve over a period the quantity and quality of services in Irish that public bodies, designated under the Act, provide.  In addition to the general obligations on public bodies under the Act regarding communications, publications, stationery, signage, etc., it is as a result of language schemes that are agreed with public bodies that a system is in place to improve the number and standard of services available to the public through Irish.<\/p> <p>In addition to the general obligations on public bodies under the Act regarding communications, publications, stationery, signage etc., it is as a result of language schemes agreed with public bodies that a system is in place to improve the number and standard of services available to the public through Irish.  Some 109 language schemes have been agreed with public bodies since the Official Languages Act came into effect.  These schemes cover 194 public bodies in total.  Although approximately 600 public bodies come under the Act, the schemes that are in place cover those bodies that have most contact with the public.  It should be noted that the provisions of each scheme remain in force until a new scheme is agreed.<\/p><p>To date, the National Treasury Management Agency has not been asked to prepare a scheme under section 11 of the Act.  This is because the focus has primarily been on agreeing schemes with bodies that have the most contact with the public.  I hope the Senator will appreciate that the National Treasury Management Agency would not fall into that category.<\/p><p>The system of language schemes is a central part of the Act and I understand the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is committed to operating and improving the system so that it operates effectively across the entire public sector.  I understand that staff restructuring was undertaken in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht earlier in the year, as a result of which extra staff are now dealing specifically with the Official Languages Act.<\/p><p>It should be noted, of course, that there has been a considerable change in the State's economic circumstances since the Act was enacted and there have been large reductions in the budgets provided to public bodies in addition to the moratorium on recruitment.  These difficult circumstances pose particular challenges for public bodies, particularly with regard to increasing the quality and quantity of the Irish language services they are able to commit to under their language schemes.<\/p><p>Clearly, the language scheme system under the Official Languages Act is not without its faults, and it should be acknowledged that it is a complex process to agree and confirm schemes, particularly in the challenging economic environment we are currently facing.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, five schemes have been confirmed to date this year, and approximately 120 draft schemes from public companies are being considered currently.  Therefore, I hope there will be an increase in the number of schemes that will be confirmed in the future.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is currently conducting a review of the Official Languages Act, in accordance with the commitments given in the programme for Government.  The review covers all the provisions of the Act, including those relating to language schemes.  The objectives of the review are to ensure that the Act is an effective mechanism to support the development of Irish in a cost-effective manner, and that the obligations arising from the Act are appropriate to ensure the satisfactory provision of services in Irish by public bodies which are in line with demand.<\/p><p>A comprehensive review of the legislation has been undertaken by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which included a public consultation process, as a result of which approximately 1,600 replies were received.  In accordance with the Government's legislative programme, it is hoped that the official languages (amendment) Bill will be published this year, in which provision will be made for the amendments to the Act arising from the review.  The appropriate steps are being taken by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to draft the heads of Bill and it is hoped that the draft heads will be submitted to the Government as soon as possible.  The results of the recommendations received through the consultation process have been analysed and they will be published in due course on the Department's website along with the heads of Bill.  The Bill will provide for amendments to the legislation arising from the review.  In addition, it will provide for amendments arising from the decision to merge the Office of the Irish Language Commissioner with the Office of the Ombudsman, as specified in the Government's public service reform plan.  I trust that this provides sufficient information to the House on the steps that are being undertaken by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under the Official Languages Act 2003.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800064#QQQ00900","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374174300,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>I am concerned with part of the answer that indicates that due to budgetary constraints any State body is allowed not to implement the law of the land.  The Official Languages Act is the law of the land, whether we like it or not.  I cannot think of any other law that any semi-State body would be allowed or ordered not to implement because of budgetary constraints.  The use of the phrase \"there has been a considerable change in the State's economic circumstances since the Act was enacted\" by the Minister of State indicates that the Government is willing to allow semi-state bodies and Departments to turn a blind eye to the law of the land.  That is a matter of serious concern and I ask the Minister of State to convey that message to his Cabinet colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071800065#RRR00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1374174300,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>I am not overstating the reply.
