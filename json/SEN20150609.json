I have hardly got up at any stage during those years without there being some doubt, confusion and speculation about the status and future of the hospital which for years has been the poor relation and playing second fiddle for all sorts of reason and sometimes not least because of political bias and interference.  Be that as it may be, the hospital has been underfunded, understaffed and under-resourced and, therefore, undermined.  I thought, however, that we were coming out the other end and that we were seeing light at the end of the tunnel, thanks in no small part to the Minister's personal and direct intervention.  It is, unfortunately, groundhog day for the hospital and we are back in the throes of not knowing where we stand or what the future holds.  This is not fair to the staff, community and those who desperately require and need the services of the hospital daily.  While it was not a problem caused by the Minister, it falls to him and the Government to address and solve it and not let it linger on.<\/p><p>In January the new CEO of the hospital group confirmed categorically that Portlaoise hospital was secure, that it would be retained as a model 3 hospital and that its 24\/7 accident and emergency department would continue and was safe and secure.  Last week, however, out of the blue, with no warning, like a bombshell, it was announced in the media that there was some doubt about the immediate term prospects of the 24\/7 accident and emergency department.  I cannot tell the Minister about the shock, distress, disbelief and anxiety this has caused throughout the community.  The hospital has a population catchment of approximately 200,000.  It is not, therefore, a local issue or a local hospital.  It serves Athy, Monasterevin and Rathangan, as well as counties Carlow and Offaly.<\/p><p>It is a resourcing issue.  If it is a question of staff, emergency consultants and nurses, let us address it in that way and once and for all stop running away from it and saying it is not a resourcing issue.  No hospital in the country could bear the forensic scrutiny and microscopic investigations that have been conducted at Portlaoise hospital as a result of the tragic and unfortunate deaths in the maternity unit.  I am glad to say, however, that most people now believe the Minister has vigorously and comprehensively addressed that issue.<\/p><p>I am not here to make an emotional appeal to save the hospital.  We have a credible, coherent and constructive case to make for the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise which is based on merit, medical grounds, clinical need and community requirements.  It has the only accident and emergency department between Naas and Limerick.  The ambulance network is not in place to start transferring patients, as suggested, to other accident and emergency departments.  The Minister has seen such cases this week at St. James's Hospital, in Tallaght, Limerick and elsewhere.  Is it proposed that we compound these problems by diverting between 30,000 and 40,000 cases from Portlaoise because that is the number of cases at the accident and emergency department there?  It is one of the busiest accident and emergency departments in the country outside the capital and other cities.  It is located near the intersection of the M7 and M8 motorways.  Some 21,500 vehicles pass through Portlaoise on a daily basis and it is twice that figure at weekends.  There are some 2,000 births in the maternity unit annually, which means that between five and ten babies are born there every day.  As the Minister knows, babies do not always choose to come between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  They are born at all hours of the night and at weekends.<\/p><p>The hospital is located across the road from two high security prisons, with 1,200 prison staff.  The Prison Officers Association is incensed and cannot believe the proposition that the 24\/7 accident and emergency department in Portlaoise hospital be closed, given the security, health and safety and cost implications in having to transfer staff who have been attacked or stabbed by prisoners or prisoners to other hospitals.<\/p><p>I want the Minister to bring some clarity to the issue.  I am not saying he has to have an absolute solution today, but we need a clear plan and commitment to the future of the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The starting point for service provision and patient safety has to be an absolute commitment to the bedrock that is the 24\/7 accident and emergency department.

I appreciate the Senator's support for the hospital through the years and his interest in the matter.  I am committed to securing and further developing the role of Portlaoise hospital as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, which includes St. James's Hospital, Tallaght hospital, Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, Naas General Hospital, and the Coombe hospital.  Any change to services in Portlaoise will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner, taking account of existing patient flow demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Any decisions will be made on the basis of maximising patient safety and patient outcomes, not financial considerations or political bias or interference, to use the Senator's words.  That will not happen.<\/p> <p>In recent months, substantial investment and enhancement measures have been put in place to ensure a safer level of services at Portlaoise hospital.  Maternity services are being upgraded following the agreement of a memorandum of understanding between the Health Service Executive and the Coombe to provide a managed clinical maternity network within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  This will provide for the delivery of a single maternity service over two sites, Portlaoise and the Coombe, with clinical governance led by the latter.  Agreement has been reached on the recruitment of two additional obstetricians, one of whom will be the new clinical lead for the Portlaoise hospital maternity service, two neonatologists, to be shared across both sites, some additional clinical and allied health support, and a broad agreement on shared services and information technology.  An implementation plan in this regard will be put in place in the coming months.  Further improvements in Portlaoise include the provision of a number of additional consultant posts in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics and general medicine, and 16 midwifery posts.  In addition, it is intended to provide a new acute medical admissions unit and expand day surgery at the hospital.<\/p> <p>The hospital group CEO has set out clearly what is being proposed at Portlaoise, with maternity, acute medical and paediatric services to continue and elective day surgery likely to be expanded.  Patient safety and patient outcomes must be the first consideration.  Last week, the HSE advised that complex surgery at Portlaoise - bowel surgery, in particular - will be transferred to St. James's or Tullamore, as the volumes at Portlaoise are too low to maintain the requisite expertise of the clinical staff.  Indeed, the Health Information and Quality Authority report specifically criticises the HSE for recruiting additional colorectal surgeons at Portlaoise when patient numbers were not sufficient to allow those staff to maintain their skills.  Patient volumes are very often a consideration, not just staff and resources.  One must have both and be able to sustain both.  As a result of this change, we will see the discontinuation of undifferentiated surgical cases that present at Portlaoise emergency department.<\/p> <p>The important point to understand is that the work is being done to strengthen services in Portlaoise from a patient safety and quality perspective and to ensure services currently provided by the hospital which are not viable are discontinued and those which are viable are safety assured and adequately resourced.  This is in keeping with the recommendations of the HIQA report into services at Portlaoise and reports on other hospitals in the past.  I am confident these changes will improve services for patients at Portlaoise.<\/p> <p>In respect of Portlaoise emergency department specifically, it receives, as the Senator noted, between 30,000 and 40,000 attendances per year.  There is no question, therefore, of its being closed.  The only question that has emerged, as raised by the CEO, is whether 24-hour services are sustainable.  No decision in this regard has been made or can yet be made.  In the case of Navan, for example, surgical services are no longer provided, but the hospital continues to offer a 24-hour emergency department for medical patients and those with minor injuries.  I strongly agree with the Senator that any proposal to end 24-hour services at Portlaoise could not be advanced without a clear and credible plan to provide additional capacity at Tullamore, Naas and Tallaght, which are already very overstretched.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015060900002#C00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1433856600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and for departing from his script to deal specifically with the accident and emergency service issue.

I believe the group chief executive officer added to the confusion and created a great deal of anxiety when he went on the airwaves, without consultation with anyone, and certainly not the public representatives or the community, and speculated as to the future prospects for 24 hours, seven days a week accident and emergency services.  As far as I am concerned it would be an untenable position to consider phasing out those services or returning them on an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. basis.

I know the Senator, and all the Senators, not just in Laois but in every constituency, would love me to be able to give a guaranteed, cast-iron commitment that services will remain on a 24 hours, seven days a week basis.  That is not something I can give to anyone about any hospital in the country.  Medicine changes over time and even when decisions are made, there can be difficulty finding senior staff.  It is not tenable in the longer term for us to continue to provide services with locum doctors, temporary doctors and doctors who are not fully trained to do the job they are expected to do.  That is a problem throughout the country.<\/p> <p>The international standard now for an emergency department is very different from what it was in the past.  Essentially, that is a department that can take undifferentiated patients who have anything wrong with them and deal with them.  For example, that is someone with a major head injury who needs neurosurgery or someone with a major injury to their chest who needs cardiothoracic surgery.  Portlaoise hospital has never provided those services and it has never been what we would now describe as a major trauma centre or an emergency department in an international context.  In Scotland there are only two of them.  In London there are only four, and the catchment area required for that type of emergency department, a major trauma centre, is a population of about 1 million.  Obviously, that would mean four, five or six in Ireland, but no one is suggesting for a second that we have only four, five or six emergency departments in Ireland.  However, we will have to look at emergency medicine and reconfigure it to ensure we have the right services in different places.  The only guarantee I can give people is that any decisions will be made based on what is best in terms of patient safety and clinical outcomes, and not based on financial considerations, political bias or political interference.

I thank the Minister for Health for coming to the House to take this question.  He is very familiar with this issue of the home help gratuity payments, and I have written to him on a number of occasions.  According to my file, the first time I raised this issue was on 12 March 2013 with the Minister's predecessor and in writing to the HSE.  In brief, this relates to a Labour Court recommendation that home help workers, many of whom are low paid, be granted a gratuity payment based on their years of service in lieu of pension entitlements.  That was for home help services that were majority funded by the HSE.  This would have a positive effect on hundreds, if not thousands, of workers throughout the country.<\/p> <p>The issue came to my attention when two ladies in the north Dublin area, Patricia Greene and Mary Hughes, raised the matter with me, and I have pursued it ever since.  The reasons we were given, which I accepted, were that while no one disagreed with the recommendation and the Government should see it through, a letter going back to 27 March 2013 stated that due to current financial constraints, the position remained the same, that is, that Government was not going to pay the gratuities due to many of these workers.  They are all front-line workers but many of them are low paid, and these are significant payments.<\/p> <p>Having been stonewalled by the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, when the Minister took over the position I got a decent answer in February of this year stating that he had initiated a review of the matter following advice from the Department's legal adviser, which would involve the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the Minister's own Department, and they were due to report back by the end of March this year.  We are in June now.  I have continued to write to the HSE and the Minister's own good offices seeking an update.  Those people deserve this money.  It is an entitlement in lieu of pensions and we have to let them know one way or the other whether Government will pay what is due to them.  If that is not the case, it should let them know, but I will be one of those supporting them going to the courts to enforce the Labour Court recommendation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope we can see a resolution.

I am seeking an update from the Minister today that, hopefully, has some cast-iron timelines.  The Department and the Minister said that they would report back by March.

It is a timely opportunity to update the House.  The matter was considered by the parties at the recent public sector talks facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission at Lansdowne House.  While there will always be a need for long-term residential care, older people consistently tell us that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as is possible.<\/p> <p>The HSE will spend approximately &euro;330 million this year on home help and home care packages.  These services are provided directly by the HSE, private organisations or voluntary organisations funded by the HSE.  Home help services are provided mainly by the HSE's directly employed staff.  In the greater Dublin area, Wicklow and Clare, home help services are provided by voluntary providers on behalf of the HSE.  These voluntary providers are funded under section 39 of the Health Act.  The HSE has in place service-level agreements with these providers that set out the level of home help service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation and requirements relating to standards of care.<\/p> <p>As the home helps employed by these section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, the HSE does not determine the salaries or other terms and conditions to apply to these staff, including pension arrangements.  Accordingly, such arrangements offered by individual providers will vary.  The pay and superannuation terms and conditions of the staff concerned are not subject to the control of the Department of Health and they are not classified as public servants.  The granting of any pension entitlement in such circumstances to private or voluntary sector employees would have wide-ranging implications for the taxpayer that go well beyond home helps.<\/p> <p>Access for home helps in voluntary organisations to a pension scheme similar to that provided for home helps in the employment of the HSE has been the subject of a number of Labour Court recommendations involving SIPTU, IMPACT and the HSE.  Implementation of the Labour Court recommendation on payment of a gratuity to the home helps employed by the section 39 organisations has been hindered in recent years by the budgetary situation and is further complicated by the fact that the HSE is not the employer.  <\/p> <p>I am pleased to confirm that the issue was discussed during the recent Lansdowne Road talks and that the parties reached agreement on a process for giving formal consideration to the matter.

However, it is recognised that most living donors incur financial losses while donating a kidney.  The scheme that I have introduced is based on the premise that any reimbursement granted does not provide a financial incentive or reward to the potential donor.  The reimbursement scheme applies to a person who has been selected as a potential donor by the living donor programme at Beaumont Hospital and to those who, under clinical supervision of the national renal transplant programme at Beaumont, travel to the United Kingdom for a paired kidney donation.<\/p> <p>The loss of earnings incurred from the time the donation takes place and up to 12 weeks post-donation are eligible for reimbursement.  A maximum of &euro;6,000 applies in respect of loss of earnings and payments can apply to either salaried or self-employed donors.  In addition to loss of earnings, reasonable travel and accommodation expenses incurred from when the person is selected as a potential donor through to the inpatient stay when the donation takes place and for up to 12 weeks post-donation are eligible for reimbursement.  Again, there is an upper limit of &euro;6,000.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to inform the House that provision was included in the Finance Act 2014 to ensure that these reimbursements are exempt from income tax.  The Department of Social Protection has agreed that in circumstances where a donor is in receipt of a payment from that Department, such payments will continue for a period of up to 12 weeks from donation.  This is, of course, provided that such payments are in line with the normal rules and regulations of the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>The reimbursement scheme is administered by the HSE.  Up to the end of May it had received 13 applications for reimbursement from living donors and has paid out &euro;15,000 so far.  In conjunction with the HSE, my Department proposes to review the operation of the scheme before the end of the year to see how it is working and to consider how it might work better.<\/p> <p>Finally I wish to put on record my thanks and those of the Government as well as our appreciation to living kidney donors, who donated kidneys in record numbers last year.  The gift of life they have given to others is an example to all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015060900002#F00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1433856600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply.

The issue I raise today concerns the appointment of a resident engineer to the centre.  I understand the position was advertised and located in Cork.  Malin and Dublin have resident engineers but even though Valentia is busier than those centres its engineer will be located 200 km away from it.  The engineer will be responsible for maintaining VHF communications with a considerable number of sites along the Cork and Kerry coastline.

It is hard to understand why the engineer who will be servicing our busiest marine rescue co-ordination centre will be based 200 km away while Malin and Dublin will have theirs on site in residence.

The engineering branch of the Irish Coast Guard provides a national maritime safety telecommunications and responder alerting and notification service.  This involves the provision of a wide range of diverse but specialised systems.  All design, procurement, project management, and subsequent administration and maintenance are carried out in-house by the small number of staff servicing this area.<\/p> <p>Due to the large quantity of systems, services and equipment, and the need to replace aged equipment to ensure service availability, the engineering section is undertaking continual programmes of equipment modernisation.  The workload has grown considerably in recent years due in no small part to the continual evolution of services that the automatic identification system, AIS, provides and the proliferation of external users, including the Naval Service, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the North Sea regional server and the Maritime Safety and Security Information System, all of which use the system for the interconnection and exchange of data.<\/p> <p>The role of an engineering officer covers a broad range of duties in terms of the management and operation of all technical aspects of the marine communications network.  The engineering officer is required to diagnose and maintain a broad range of radio and telecommunications equipment used in maritime communications, responder alert and notification, vessel tracking technologies, and supporting infrastructure, including maintenance of all equipment employed in the national maritime communication networks; fault analysis across multiple wide-area telecommunication networks; identification and analysis of fault trends nationally and by equipment type; maintenance of radio site infrastructure, including antennae, masts, buildings, perimeter and access; maintenance of communications equipment at Coast Guard unit station houses, including equipment in boats and vehicles; co-ordination and management of multiple subcontractor and utility providers; and co-ordination and management of local spares and stock holding.<\/p> <p>Additionally - this is an important factor in the requirement to fill the vacancy which arose in the Cork office - the engineering officer is responsible for the maintenance of communications equipment at Coast Guard unit station houses, including equipment in boats and vehicles and the co-ordination and management of multiple subcontractor and utility providers.  The engineering officer reports to an electronics officer based in Dublin, who is responsible for the overall management and operation of all technical aspects of the national marine communications network.<\/p> <p>Following recent amalgamations, there are currently approximately ten Coast Guard units throughout Cork and five in Kerry.  A significant amount of travel throughout the region and out-of-hours availability is a necessary feature of the role.  The Cork office continues to provide a good location for the overall fulfilment of the various engineering responsibilities and it is for this reason that the post is located in Cork.<\/p> <p>The post became available on foot of the retirement of the previous incumbent.

It goes back to the earlier point I made that the engineer is based in Dublin, servicing the marine rescue co-ordination centre there and Malin yet the busiest station is in Valentia and the engineer will be based in Cork, 200 km away.  While there are ten Coast Guard units in Cork and five in Kerry the requirement for maintenance of equipment is minimal compared to the important equipment at Valentia.  If that equipment or the utilities coming into it suffer a catastrophic failure as stated in one report, prior to the new equipment being installed, nothing else works.  If something goes down in Ballycotton, only Ballycotton is out of action; if something goes down in Valentia, everything from Cork to the Aran Islands goes out of action, hence the reason we believe an engineer should be living on the island and working there during the day but also available at short notice.  That was the issue raised in Kerry about the position being filled.  As the Minister is in the House I avail of the opportunity to congratulate him on his post but also to advise him that the two previous incumbents received reports on the reason Valentia should be closed.  There is an agenda within the Department and the Coast Guard to close Valentia.  Unfortunately the Oireachtas joint committee had to invite in the senior civil servants from the Department and take apart their reports line by line.  When the facts were uncovered it was clear that the reports presented to this and the previous Government were at variance with the truth.  When I was younger I watched \"Yes Minister\" but never thought I would see it in action but I did.

While there, one of the issues emphasised to me was that the advances that have taken place, following Government investment, mean that if any critical system for any catastrophic reason were not to work the same system and capacity can be deployed via the other two key stations in Malin and Dublin.  If for any reason a systems failure were to occur, owing to the investment that has been put in place we have the capacity for the other two key stations to play a role in sustaining safety.<\/p> <p>In respect of any reports I have received, I have no such report in front of me.

The location was chosen for those reasons and it is a decision I support, given the expertise that went into making it.

At the very least, if the Government has now decided by a vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that the stake in Aer Lingus is to be sold, all the arguments that many Members made contrary to that are on the record of the House.  I will not go over them as, unfortunately, the Government has made the decision against Members' wishes but that is as it is.<\/p> <p>My point now is that the approximately &euro;340 million for which the Government is selling this strategic State interest should be used to offset the savage cuts the Government has imposed on the pension scheme members in the airport.  At the end of the day, this sale and the money the Government will receive could not have gone through without the cuts the Government made to the pension scheme.  I refer to the 15,000 members, the deferred pensioners who were cut by up to 60%, long-service members whose pension benefits were torn asunder, the retired members, that is, people in their 70s, 80s and 90s who have lost six weeks' pay and the 5,000 existing members who have been moved out of a good pension scheme unilaterally and thrown into an inferior scheme.<\/p> <p>If the Government is to get &euro;340 million, instead of using it in its connectivity fund, whatever the hell that is, or instead of putting it into a fund to use for its own preferment prior to the general election, adding it to its slush fund, the Government should give the money back to the people from whom it took it.  The Government should give it back to the deferred pensioners, to the retired pensioners and to the members of the Irish aviation superannuation scheme, IAAS.  As the Government should give such a commitment here, I seek to have this debated and I seek the Seanad's support for the motion I tabled in the week before the recess, namely, &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommends that, should the Government proceed with the sale of the 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus, the monies received be used to reduce the savage cuts imposed on Aer Lingus Pension Scheme members.\"  That is fair and would go some way towards rectifying a most grossly unfair situation that prevails in respect of the first pension scheme in the history of the State for which any Government introduced legislation to reduce members' entitlements.

In that context and as Senators are aware, the Government is being examined by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  As a new narrative develops in the lead-up to the forthcoming general election in the context of the stabilisation of Ireland's finances as a basis for future fairness, it is imperative that parliamentarians and the Irish people take account of what the UN committee is saying.  Otherwise we will only be treating the UN process as simply a paper-pushing exercise.  A primary message coming from the committee is that any cuts made as emergency crisis measures must be temporary and that what was taken away must be restored.  For example, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and NGOs have put forward strong arguments in the context of demanding the restoration of the one-parent family income disregards to the levels at which they stood in 2012.  One-parent families have become poorer since 2012 and the UN committee has not missed that fact.<\/p> <p>My question to the Leader relates to how seriously the Government takes what various UN committees with responsibility for human rights say to us and why we, as lawmakers, are virtually excluded from having any oversight in respect of this country meeting its international human rights obligations.

However, we, as parliamentarians, have had no input whatsoever with regard to what the Minister of State is saying.  In such circumstances, does what he is saying to the committee really mean anything at all?  When questioned on RTE as to why the Government is not accepting the Constitutional Convention's recommendation to include economic, social and cultural rights in our Constitution, the Minister of State indicated that our corpus of domestic human rights law and EU law are sufficient to deal with those issues.

A man aged almost 80 years was on a trolley in University Hospital Galway, UHG, for three days over the weekend before eventually being given a bed in the medical assessment unit.  That is unacceptable.  Everyone can appreciate that doctors and nurses do sterling work in hospitals.  However, the accident and emergency department in UHG is not fit for purpose.  It is one of the busiest accident and emergency departments in the country and has a wide catchment area.  In addition, insufficient beds are available.  I am conscious that the special delivery unit is to deploy a team to make specific plans and recommendations for units which are under particular pressure such as that in UHG.  While I was informed by the Minister for Health recently that he hopes to include a new accident and emergency department in the forthcoming capital programme, which I support 100%, we need to plan for the future.  I am informed that the hospital in Galway performs reasonably well in discharging patients who no longer need acute care.  The issue, therefore, is a lack of beds.  We need more, as the population is ageing and people are living longer.  I would like to move beyond day-to-day management and have a constructive debate on the issue in the House.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to come to the House to explore locations where beds are needed and to have a strategy in place under which long-term plans can be implemented?

I am unashamedly pro-life.  I do accept the complexities involved and I would like to think that I am more on the liberal side of thinking in this regard but when it comes to choice between the unborn and whether they live or die, somebody has to speak for the unborn.  I believe our constitutional obligations speak for the unborn in that regard.  I do not enthusiastically embrace the view that appears to be now growing that somehow abortion is a human right.  There is nothing in international legislation to indicate this.  In fact, it has been made clear that it is for individual states to decide how they address this issue.

This means that one parent - usually the father - is being put in the position of not being able to appropriately parent the child and to the child not having the opportunity of being parented by both parents, which matter is fundamental to the rights of children.  It is unfortunate that, having gotten through the legal situation of the challenge to the constitutional referendum on the rights of children, we now find ourselves in the situation, in an improving economy, of children being deprived, in my opinion, of the right to be parented by both parents.

It appears frivolous when one first looks at it, but I have been contacted by a number of businesses about the issue.  One is a cash management business and there is a real shortage.  Ireland has been minting copper coins at three times the average rate in the European Union, yet there is a consistent shortage of copper coins across the country.  People value them so little that they put them on the mantlepiece or in jars in their homes and as a consequence they go out of circulation.  This is causing a consistent problem for businesses and it is a hassle shared by them.  Consumers do not care as much as businesses about this because they are such insignificant sums.  It is senseless that we are bending over backwards to produce these coins given the cost of production.  It costs 1.7 cent to produce a 1 cent coin; therefore, it is a cost to the taxpayer.  It costs a little more than 2 cent to produce a 2 cent coin.  The trial undertaken was considered a major success locally.  It resulted in a high level of consumer and business satisfaction, with 100% of retailers and 85% of consumers who participated reporting satisfaction.

This leads to discrepancies in the points awarded.  I know many students who dropped from higher to ordinary level maths as late as Easter because they believed they did not need the subject or the extra pressure.  We are trying to relieve additional pressure on such students.  They thought they had a safe subject in ordinary level maths.  However, they were confronted with almost the same question, give or take a few elements, as Question No. 9 on the higher level paper in 2013.

It is apparent from freedom of information requests that internal reports in the HSE in 2012 had brought the issue to light.  It was stated categorically that they should be brought to the attention of the Minister as a matter of urgency and that it could be a huge scandal.  At the time, the Minister with responsibility for children, Deputy Charles Flanagan, told the D&aacute;il that the deaths had brought the horrors of the mother and baby homes to the attention of the Government.  He said the practices in mother and baby homes had not featured prominently in the various reviews and investigations that had dealt with many of the abuses inflicted on vulnerable citizens, many of them women and children.  We know from freedom of information requests and the newspapers articles that at that stage the State had known about Tuam and Bessborough mother and baby homes for nearly two years.

There are also different methodologies for reporting.  The collection of data cannot always be done by computer.  One must take people into consideration, as well as computers.  We all back the best use of available resources and must all ensure the best use is made of resources.<\/p> <p>The data service manager in the Rape Crisis Network Ireland has said 64% of survivors coming to the 14 rape crisis centres in this RCNI report did not report to the garda&iacute;.  That is a huge number of people who did not report incidents to the Garda.  Survivors are central to this issue.  Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar stated:  \"The many experiences of survivors that build this evidence-base for change are only recorded here in the RCNI data system and are visible to the State in no other way.\"  She said that if we do not incorporate the data provided by the RCNI then the Government will get a false picture.  Such figures will look good on paper but the findings will be bad for the people who are raped, suffer domestic violence and everything else.<\/p> <p>I want a full debate on this matter.  I want to understand exactly how reporting is done, who reports, how statistics are compiled, and whether both elements are joined together.  The aim of the Seanad is to flush out such matters in a debate.  The board of Tusla took the decision to withdraw funding, not the Minister.  I want to know how boards make their decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015060900002#V00100","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1433856600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015060900002#V00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1433856600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I support the comments made by Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Mooney on the messages that have come from Europe on abortion.  Let me remind Senators what happened in Britain.  The Conservative Party in Britain discovered that a very large number of people were unhappy with the instructions from Europe and a referendum will be held to see if the country can temper such instructions.  It is quite fair that we have been independent for almost 100 years and, therefore, make our own decisions.  It is logical that views coming from Britain do not interfere with our decisions.  The subject is worthy of debate.  Senators Mooney and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; clearly explained their opinions on the matter and I support their views but that does not mean we should not have a debate.  The subject is worthy of a debate.<\/p> <p>I also support Senator Noone's comments on the withdrawal of the 1 cent and 2 cent coins.  The Central Bank asked me to travel to Wexford to act as an ambassador in an experiment where the coinage was withdrawn and this happened about a year ago.  The experiment proved very successful.  Instead of either rounding up or down a price both were done in order to get rid of the 1 cent and 2 cent coins.  It does not make sense to have such coins but it makes a great deal of sense to have the 5 cent coin as the lowest unit.<\/p> <p>Finland and the Netherlands never introduced the 1 cent and 2 cent coins and instead their lowest coin was 5 cent when they commenced using the euro.  Such a move makes sense.  The prices are still the same as they ever were.  Whether a price ends with 96 cent, 97 cent, 98 cent or 99 cent, a price is rounded to the nearest 5 cent coin.  There was no upping of prices.  There were no criticism levelled that the initiative was used in such a manner.  It is on that basis that we should support Senator Noone's call to abolish the 1 cent and 2 cent coins.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Feargal Quinn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The expense involved is outrageous.

A new building is needed and I urge the Minister to proceed with the project as a matter of urgency.  The shortage of beds in many hospitals is leading to a situation where patients are left on trolleys for unacceptably long periods which is adding to the waiting lists for many procedures.<\/p> <p>An equally significant issue that needs to be addressed is the difficulty in recruiting key medical personnel, including nurses, at many hospitals.  Large numbers of our best and brightest are working in the health service in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and elsewhere.

We are now at a stage where a certain degree of media dominance is beginning to cause difficulty.  That is why we need to hear from the Minister and have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.

I wish to speak about IBRC, the commission of investigation, the role of the Seanad and all the issues that have brought this to a head this week.  It is very important to remember that under the commission of investigation legislation, the Seanad has the same role as the D&aacute;il.  This commission of investigation cannot go ahead without the D&aacute;il and Seanad approving the draft terms of reference and the statement of reasons for this commission of investigation.  It is really important that we take our responsibilities as Senators and as a House of the Oireachtas under this legislation very seriously and that we have a full, frank and proper debate on these terms of reference.  If possible, a delegation from the Seanad should meet the Minister for Finance to discuss the terms of reference.  It is probably too late for that because he has already published them.  We are all too keen in this House to denigrate ourselves and put ourselves down as second-class, but in this case we are not second-class.  We are first-class and are equal to the D&aacute;il, but that entails a significant requirement to take that responsibility and equality very seriously.  I understand the Leader has possibly changed things but it appears we are throwing in a draft motion and it will be approved without debate.  This will not be acceptable.<\/p> <p>The Seanad should be ashamed of itself for, by and large, staying silent when an attack was made by Mr. O'Brien on parliamentary privilege, which encompasses the reporting of what is said in Parliament.  We should have been asserting our rights - the rights of the Houses of the Oireachtas which are exercised on behalf of the people.  Most Members of this House were completely silent .  Only my party leader, Deputy Martin, took it upon himself to show leadership on this issue on behalf of both Houses while the Taoiseach stayed completely silent, opening bottle banks and giving out about Sepp Blatter and John Delaney.  That is exactly what happened last week.<\/p> <p>What happened last weekend in respect of Deputy Catherine Murphy's contribution in the other House was a disgrace.  We could not sit last week to discuss it to assert it and assert our rights.  Let us be honest.  There is no superiority of powers when we talk about the separation of powers.  There is a difference.  The courts have no role in what we say in here and that was acknowledged very clearly and succinctly by the judge last week.  We can say whatever we like in here and we should be standing up for that right and the right of the media to report it and not be relying on some nonsensical excuse that we must wait for a court case.
