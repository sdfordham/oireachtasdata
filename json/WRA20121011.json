ComReg also noted that coverage continues to be an important differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market such that any material deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network&rsquo;s attractiveness to its existing and potential costumers.

The 30 megabits speed is a minimum target, I expect that significantly higher speeds will be available to as many enterprises and homes as possible.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan for Ireland commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: 70&ndash;100 megabits per second  will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40 megabits per second and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and a minimum of 30 megabits per second  for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  The provision of electronic communications services, which includes the provision of high speed broadband services, operates within a fully liberalised EU internal market. Intervention by any Government in that market must comply with EU competition law and its rules on State Aids in particular.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators and no issue of State Aid arises. <\/p><p>  A qualifying requirement of EU State Aids&rsquo; rules generally is that the aid does not displace or distort public or private commercial investment in that product market at the quality level required. <\/p><p>  In the case of state aid for broadband products and services, any State Aid must comply with EU Commission guidelines specific to State Aid investment in broadband infrastructure.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country, as required by the sectoral state aids guidelines.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department on the mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  An additional requirement of the guidelines is that any market intervention is technology neutral.  The National Broadband Plan cannot therefore dictate the technological solution which will be used in a future public procurement process to identify a network provider or providers.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the mapping exercise is an essential element in any State Aids notification and will also inform the design of the procurement process.

Such an exercise would require the identification of reliable comparable data sets suitable for the precise purpose of understanding and explaining the relationship between the relevant fuel costs and electricity prices.  Suitable data sets are not readily available, particularly in the case of fuel costs.  Timeliness of available data is also an issue.  In the case of electricity prices, EU level data are only made available six months to a year after the period to which they relate.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since 2008, and every six months approximately, Eurostat publishes comparable data on electricity and gas prices for all EU states.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) publishes analyses of those Eurostat data twice a year.  The analysis is conducted by the Energy Policy Statistical Support Unit (EPSSU), the specialist statistical unit of SEAI and each price analysis publication covers a six month period (either January to June or July to December).<\/p><p><br \/>  SEAI analysis demonstrates that a number of factors influence energy prices in Ireland, and show how prices here compare with other EU countries.  These factors include, but are not limited to, imported fuel prices, energy infrastructure investment costs, Ireland&#8217;s electricity generating fuel mix and non-energy costs that affect energy prices (for example, taxes levied, employment costs, raw material and transport and shipping costs).<\/p><p><br \/>  The fuel mix for electricity generation has a key bearing on the variation in the price of electricity in different countries.  This is particularly significant in the case of an electricity fuel mix which relies to a significant extent on internationally traded fossil fuels, such as gas, oil and coal.  During periods of volatile price movements in these fuels there is a strong consequential knock-on impact on electricity prices in the short term.  Other factors that affect electricity prices include the level of competition in electricity generation and supply, labour costs, geographic isolation and the extent of population dispersal, taxation policy and the level of investment required in infrastructure to improve the transmission and distribution networks.<\/p><p><br \/>  According to the SEAI analysis Ireland has close to the highest overall dependency on fossil fuels for electricity generation across the EU at 78%, behind the Netherlands at 83%, Cyprus 98% and Malta at 100%.  Within the fossil fuel category, the analysis shows that Ireland additionally has a high dependency on gas in electricity generation, at 62%.  This is the third highest share of gas generation in electricity, behind Luxembourg at 64% and the Netherlands at 63%.<\/p><p><br \/>  Our heavy reliance on gas imported from the UK and traded in Sterling means that Irish electricity prices are susceptible to fluctuations in the wholesale cost of gas and in exchange rate movements.  According to the September 2012 Bord G&aacute;is Energy Index, in the 12 months to September 2012 the wholesale cost of natural gas has increased by 20% and the Euro has weakened by 7% compared to Sterling.  This will affect the cost of generating electricity in Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The latest analysis of data published by Eurostat for electricity prices is published by the SEAI and covers the period July to December 2011.

In developing plans for the development of digital television in Ireland, my predecessor was cognisant that the UK was also upgrading their television services to digital.  Digital is more efficient than analogue TV.  It is capable of carrying many more TV channels.  In this regard and in order to provide for a coordinated approach to analogue switch off on both sides of the border relevant officials entered into discussions with their UK counterparts.<\/p><p><br \/>  As a result of these discussions, a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) was signed jointly by the UK and Irish Governments on 1<sup>st<\/sup> February 2010.  A copy of the MOU is available at   .<\/p><p><br \/>    The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is: <\/p><p><br \/>  1. To provide a mechanism for co-operation between the Governments of Ireland and UK in providing a framework for the transition to digital terrestrial television and analogue switch off.  <\/p><p><br \/>  2. To provide for TG4 to be carried in Northern Ireland on the digital TV network; <\/p><p><br \/>  3. To provide an opportunity for RT&Eacute; to be transmitted within Northern Ireland and for BBC to be transmitted in Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to TG4, the MOU draws on the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement 1998 and the 2006 St. Andrews Agreement which provided for the availability of TG4 throughout Northern Ireland over the analogue network.  The MOU extends this provision and secures the carriage of TG4 on the digital network in Northern Ireland.  In relation to RT&Eacute;, the MOU commits both Governments to seeking to find a technical and cost effective solution to the provision of RT&Eacute; throughout Northern Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since the MOU was signed, relevant Irish and UK officials and representatives from TG4 and RT&Eacute;, have continued to meet and to work together to provide for the full implementation of the MOU.  This work has led to an agreement on the provision of TG4, RT&Eacute; and Raidio na Gaeltachta on a special multiplex in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a company owned jointly by RT&Eacute; and TG4 to operate this multiplex.  This new multiplex, which will begin operation on 24<sup>th<\/sup>   October 2012- the date of Digital Switchover, provides 75% coverage within Northern Ireland.  When the coverage is combined with overspill of the Irish TV channels from Ireland, Northern Ireland will have 94% coverage of these Irish TV channels.  This is the first time in the history of broadcasting that RT&Eacute; and TG4 will be available throughout the island of Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the issue of BBC coverage within Ireland, this is a commercial matter for the BBC as, unlike RT&Eacute;, the BBC has no mandate to provide coverage within Ireland.  In this regard, my understanding is that, to date, the BBC has expressed no interest in being carried on SAORVIEW.  Notwithstanding, BBC programming is freely available throughout Ireland over satellite and is also available in border areas via terrestrial TV overspill from the UK and Northern Ireland.

The Group A threshold also applies where the inheritance taken by the parent is taken on the death of the child as opposed to, for example, an inheritance taken by the parent at a later date on the death of an intervening life tenant.<\/p><p><br \/>  Gifts by children to parents fall within the Group B tax-free threshold of &#8364;33,500.  Separately, Section 79 Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides that, subject to certain conditions, an inheritance taken by a parent from a child is completely exempt from Inheritance Tax and does not fall to be taken into account in calculating tax on later gifts or inheritances from any source. There are two conditions to be satisfied before the Inheritance Tax exemption is available: <\/p><p><br \/>  (i) the inheritance must be taken on the death of the child; and<\/p><p><br \/>  (ii) within the five year period prior to the death of the child, the child must have taken a taxable gift or inheritance from either or both of his\/her parents.<\/p><p><br \/>  Where a beneficiary receives benefits in excess of his or her Group threshold, a 30% rate of Capital Acquisitions Tax applies on the difference. <\/p><p><br \/>  In summary, the Group A threshold of &#8364;250,000 applies to all gifts and inheritances taken by a child from a parent and equally applies also to all absolute inheritances taken by a parent from a child. Inheritances taken by a parent from a child may also qualify for complete exemption from Inheritance Tax where the inheritance taken is an absolute inheritance and where the child has taken a taxable gift or inheritance from either parent in the previous five years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100041#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100041#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[43862\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100041#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will advise on whether a person (details supplied) is entitled to any tax refund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer in question has previously applied for and received balancing statements for 2011, but did not request a full four-year review.

Principal contractors are defined in the legislation (section 530A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) as including &#8220;any board or body established by or under statute &#8230; and funded wholly or mainly out of funds provided by the Oireachtas&#8221;.  As such, school Boards of Management are principal contractors for the purposes of RCT.  Under VAT law, where a principal contractor (generally as defined for RCT purposes) receives services consisting of construction operations (again generally as defined for RCT purposes) the principal is an accountable person and is liable to pay the VAT chargeable on those services on a reverse charge basis.  In this regard, where a school Board of Management receives services consisting of construction operations the Board must register for VAT and account for VAT on the received services.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also informed that Finance Act 2011 did not introduce any change in terms of the obligations of Boards of Management to operate RCT or VAT.  Nor did the Revenue Commissioners issue a directive in this regard.  Principal contractors, including school Boards of Management are, and always were, required to deduct tax from the payments made to subcontractors and pay it over to Revenue.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant subcontractors, provision is made for compliant subcontractors to receive payments without deduction of tax.  The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school Boards of Management and other principal contractors.  RCT and the VAT reverse charge system play an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.<\/p><p><br \/>  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper free system.  This has streamlined the process for the submission of information and payments to Revenue and has had the effect of significantly reducing the administrative burden associated with RCT.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of the difficulty some school Boards of Management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT and VAT systems.  Revenue has met with the Department of Education and Skills regarding the obligations of Boards of Management under the RCT and VAT systems and has also met with representatives of some Boards of Management.  In addition, Revenue has participated in a series of seminars throughout the country during September\/October 2012 organised by the<font color=\"#5F5F5F\"> <\/font>Joint Managerial Board in conjunction with the Catholic Primary School Management Association.  These seminars are aimed at school Principals, members of boards of management, bursars and secretarial\/accounts personnel who are likely to be in receipt of State funding for construction projects with a view to assisting them with their RCT and VAT responsibilities.  Detailed guidance notes specifically tailored for school Boards of Management regarding the operation of RCT and VAT were made available by Revenue in July and the availability of these notes has been highlighted to the Boards of Management representative bodies.  They have been published on the Revenue website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT and VAT systems are implemented correctly in order to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector particularly where the project involves substantial State funding.  The new online system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school Boards of Management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100043#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates Issues","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100043#WRF00325"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[44011\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100043#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he has taken to contact Allied Irish Bank regarding the recent announcement to increase their mortgage rates by 0.5% which is the bank's second rate rise within the past few months; if his attention has been drawn to the impact that this increase will have on distressed mortgage holders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Bank&#8217;s policy in relation to interest rates is a matter for the management and board of the institution.

The fundamental problem is that pensions are significantly more expensive due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflected in increased annuity rates.  <\/p><p>  The Pensions Regulator suspended the Funding Standard four years ago, following the downturn in the financial market, to give trustees\/employers an opportunity to assess the impact on pension funds and to enable them to have sufficient time to develop responses to the challenge. The re-introduction of the Funding Standard was delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to the funding challenges facing pension schemes. Among the measures introduced at that time was the provision for sovereign annuities. This provides pension scheme trustees with an option of purchasing annuities, which will have the effect of reducing pensioner liabilities under the Funding Standard, sovereign annuity products are now available and it is expected that the range of products will grow over the coming months.<\/p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of a scheme can be tested. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed. However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.<\/p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is being introduced to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirements for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes. However, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023.  <\/p><p>  Reference has been made to the easing of the solvency regime in a number of other countries. It should be noted that the solvency regime even after those changes is still more onerous that the current Irish regime. It should be noted that the changes to the Funding Standard are being implemented over the next 11 years, not immediately. This is the longest recovery period generally allowed in any European country.<\/p><p>  The Pensions Board recently announced that the timeframe for pension schemes to submit funding proposals has been extended to 30 June 2013. This extension will give schemes additional time to help them address the issues they are facing.<\/p><p>  Overall the changes made to defined benefit schemes are intended to bring increased stability to pension promises in the future and lessen schemes&rsquo; exposure to risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100046#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100047#WRK00113"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[43828\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100047#WRK00150","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an appeal against refusal of invalidity pension in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if she will expedite the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned has not been received by that office.

Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;35 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.<\/p><p>  As part of the assessment of means for rent supplement, capital (savings and investments) and the value of property owned but not personally used or enjoyed are assessed as means. Where capital or property is assessed on this basis, any income received from its use (e.g. interest on savings, dividends from shares, rent from property let) is not assessed as cash income. Instead, the following formula is used to establish weekly means:<\/p><p>  - Disregard first &euro;5,000 of capital value of property\/savings<\/p><p>  - Assess next &euro;10,000 @ &euro;1 per &euro;1,000<\/p><p>  - Assess next &euro;25,000 @ &euro;2 per &euro;1,000<\/p><p>  - Assess remaining capital over &euro;40,000 @ &euro;4 per &euro;1,000.<\/p><p>  The amount of rent supplement is determined by not only the person&rsquo;s savings, but also includes factors such as earnings, household composition and the local rent limits in force.

In 2011 expenditure on FIS amounted to almost &euro;205 million in respect of some 29,000 families.  <\/p><p>  The FIS payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments. To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. <\/p><p>  There are no plans to extend FIS to self-employed persons at the present time.  There are a number of factors that would have to be taken in to account in any consideration of extending eligibility criteria for family income supplement to include self-employed persons. There would be considerable practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition it would be impossible to establish satisfactorily their eligibility and their hours of employment would be difficult to establish and certify on an ongoing basis.  Furthermore, the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed would be considerable. Such a consideration would also need to take into account the fact that there are already arrangements in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as through jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and through farm assist for low-income farmers.  <\/p><p>  An extension of the FIS scheme would in effect change the nature of the scheme and it would not be feasible or desirable to extend FIS to the self-employed in its current form.  <\/p><p>  Nonetheless, I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including the family income supplement payment, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been asked to recommend cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100048#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100048#WRL00725"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[43953\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100048#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will outline in tabular form, the amount of money allocated by her Department and agencies within her Department to Ballina, Castlebar and Westport Town Council between 1997 and 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>The amount of money paid by my Department to Ballina, Castlebar and Westport Town Councils between 1998 and to date in 2012 is set out in the following table.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.<\/p><p>  As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions. New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These new limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. <\/p><p>  Approximately 45,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, representing 50% of total claims in payment, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the existing rent limits. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.<\/p><p>  It is my intention to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer, on which my Department is represented. This will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short term income support payment for those temporarily unemployed. <\/p><p>  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits.

I acknowledge there is a considerable amount of money being spent by the public sector each year on energy but whether a saving of &#8364;100m in two years is achievable as the report suggests, in light of the challenging economic environment, remains to be seen.  There are a number of plans and support schemes already in place but there is more that could be done.  Reduction in spend over the longer term requires sustained cross-Departmental action and procurement is one of the best levers at our disposal to achieve significant savings in the short to medium term.<\/p><p><br \/>  The current National Energy Efficiency Action Plan was published in May 2009, and outlined the framework for delivering Ireland's energy efficiency targets by 2020.  The second Action Plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy savings targets implemented under current EU requirements as well as energy efficiency policy priorities between now and 2020.  The Action Plan will show that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy saving target.<\/p><p><br \/>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &#8364;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save &#8364;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  This year the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies, including schools and healthcare facilities, to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department and the SEAI have also established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  Last month I wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI. Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: 'Energy Use in the Public Sector', which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, the recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  We will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100050#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Incentives","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100050#WRN01650"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[43957\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100050#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the EU Commission proposals that aim to cap crop based bio-fuel production to a maximum of 5% of total transport fuel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>I have not received any proposal from the EU Commission in relation to capping crop-based biofuel production.  However, I understand that a proposal relating to the use of certain biofuels will be circulated to Member States in the coming weeks.  Once I receive this, I will consider its implications for renewable energy policy and the further development of a sustainable biofuel sector in Ireland.  Such considerations will inform Ireland's position with respect to the proposed amendments.  Currently the EU Renewable Energy Directive requires Member States to meet a target of 10% of renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The Directive also specifies a set of sustainability criteria that must be applied to biofuels, before they can be counted towards a Member State's renewable energy transport target.  Under these criteria biofuels may not be made from raw materials originating from tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatland, wetland or highly biodiverse areas.<\/p><p>  Ireland will meet its renewable energy target in transport primarily through the use of biofuels and the Government intends to meet the obligation under the Renewable Energy Directive through progressively increasing sustainable biofuel penetration combined with an increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads towards the end of the decade.  The requirement that biofuels used in meeting Ireland's obligation comply with the Directive's sustainability criteria is legislated for in the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, as amended by the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 and set out in detail in European Union (Biofuel Sustainability Criteria) Regulations 2012.<\/p><p>  In 2011, approximately 2.7% of the energy in road transport came from biofuels.  Of these biofuels, over one third was produced from wastes, accounting for 1.11% of the energy used in road transport in 2011.  Biofuels from wastes or residues would not be affected by any limit imposed on the use of crop-based biofuel.  There is also significant research being undertaken in Ireland and internationally on the development of second generation biofuels, which are not using food based raw materials as input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100050#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[43835\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if eel fishing licences will be issued following the review of the eel fishing ban which was completed earlier this year; if not, whether compensation will be awarded to those who had eel fishing licences in the past; the EU directive regarding eel fishing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the question I answered in this House last week, 2 October.

In 2011 ICES reiterated its previous advice that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) affecting production and escapement of eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing.  In 2011, glass eel recruitment has fallen to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.  In Ireland, recruitment has been declining at many monitoring sites since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 numbers.  In summary, recruitment of glass eels and elvers remained low during the 2009 to 2011 period both in Ireland and across Europe.<\/p><p>  In Ireland it is anticipated that there will be a considerable decline in silver eel production, as indicated by recruitment history, yellow eel stock indicators and modelled projections for index stocks.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s eel management regime, every three years, a review of the status of eel stocks is conducted, this coupled with input from stakeholders, supports the decision making process on the future of the commercial and recreational eel fishery.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has just completed a full public consultation on the future of the commercial and recreation eel fishery; the recommendations from this review are being finalised.  In that regards the issuing of licences to fish for eel is not possible at this time.<\/p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland has made a number of reports on eel stocks available on its website including The National Eel Stock Recovery Plan, The Status of Eel Stocks in Ireland and The Implementation of the Eel Management Plan for Ireland.  The review of eel stocks in Europe is a shared concern involving many countries on a pan European basis and it is likely that a summary of all European reviews will not be available for some time.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland &ndash; IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen were contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.  There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation does not arise, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context and having regard to national economic circumstances, no provision has been made for compensation payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Offshore Exploration","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[43878\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding Dalkey Prospect oil rig and the concerns of citizens from County Wicklow on this issue, the position in relation to the Green Party's call on him to hold a public inquiry into plans for the seismic survey and drilling; the position in relation to the Oireachtas committee report calling for the terms for Ireland's shares of revenue from our oil and gas to be radically overhauled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>Standard Exploration Licence was granted last year over an area of approximately 380 square kilometres in the Kish Bank Basin off the Dublin\/Wicklow coast.  The licence is held by a consortium comprising Providence Resources Plc and PSE Seven Heads Limited.  The award of this exploration licence confers on the holder the exclusive right to search for petroleum in the licensed area, but does not confer a right to produce\/extract petroleum.  The licence was granted for a six-year period and includes an obligation to drill an exploration well by August 2014.  While my Department has not as yet received a detailed application from Providence Resources for approval to drill on the licence, I am aware that environmental and safety concerns have been raised about the proximity of the proposed well to the coast.<\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that drilling operators are required to comply with best international practice when carrying out drilling operations offshore Ireland and that my Department will only give an approval to drill once it is satisfied that drilling operations can be carried out in a safe manner and without negative social or environmental impact.  In this regard, Licence holders are required to engage a competent Independent Well Examiner to verify the safety of all drilling rigs, drilling equipment, pressure containment systems and drilling processes in advance of and during drilling operations.  The well examiner has a role for as long as drilling operations continue and is required to verify any changes to drilling plans.  Ongoing monitoring by the Independent Well Examiner, my Department&rsquo;s Advisers and my Department&rsquo;s technical specialists continues throughout the drilling of a well.  In the event that the exploration activity under this licence resulted in a commercial discovery and a petroleum production project, the licensees would require a number of statutory approvals which would include a full public consultation phase.<\/p><p>  With regards to the Joint Committee&rsquo;s report on offshore oil and gas exploration, I am sure the report will make a valuable contribution to the debate on how we should manage our indigenous oil and gas resources for the benefit of the people of Ireland.  In relation to taxation, the report recognises there is a balance to be struck between maximising revenue to the State and incentivising companies to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore.  The report goes on to recommend that the rate of tax applying to petroleum production in Ireland should be increased to between 40% and 80%, depending on the profitability of the field.  It seems that factors such as high oil prices and advances in exploration technology were key considerations influencing this recommendation.  However, high oil prices will not make Ireland any more or less attractive as a location for investment, compared to other countries with oil and gas potential.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s petroleum potential is largely unproven and this is likely to remain the case until there is a significant increase in the level of exploration activity from the current low level of exploration drilling.  At this point, I remain to be convinced how doubling the maximum tax rate would help attract much needed exploration investment to Ireland but I have committed to engaging with the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications on the Report prepared by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00525"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[43943\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will outline in tabular form, the amount of money allocated by his Department and agencies within his Department to Ballina, Castlebar and Westport Town Council between 1997 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that since the establishment of my Department in June 2007, it has not allocated any money to Ballina, Castlebar or Westport Town Council.

These benefits will only be realised through effective exploration.  Ireland has a policy of actively encouraging investment by relevant companies in exploration for oil and gas, both offshore and onshore.  Where exploration or production takes place, it is subject to a robust regulatory framework, with a clear objective of ensuring that all exploration and production activities are carried out in a safe manner and without significant environmental or social impact.<\/p><p>  I am very conscious that some concerns have been strongly expressed that use of the technology known as hydraulic fracturing in exploration and production activities, could have a negative impact on the environment.  The principal concerns that have been expressed relate to the production phase of a project and environmental considerations arising from the large number of production wells that may be hydraulically fractured.  In February of last year, my Department granted onshore Licensing Options to three companies over parts of the Lough Allen and Clare Basin respectively.  The Licensing Options are preliminary authorisations and are different to exploration licences.  The Options are for a two year period from 1 March 2011.  During this period, the companies will evaluate the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data.  Exploration drilling is not permitted under these authorisations.<\/p><p>  It is too early to say if any of the existing onshore licensing options will even progress to the exploration phase, let alone to a production phase, however, the statutory framework that would apply to such an application is the framework that is already in use in the case of a range of major strategic infrastructure projects.  Under that framework a developer would require consents from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This would result in a consideration of the potential environmental impact of any proposed petroleum production project, subject to EU environmental Directives, including the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which requires full public consultation.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in May of this year the Environmental Protection Agency published its preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction in the form of a small desk based study, which was carried out by the University of Aberdeen.  The study provides an introduction to the environmental aspects of fracking including a review of regulatory approaches used in other countries and areas for further investigation and research such as geological principles of relevance in fracking and shale gas extraction, potential environmental impacts and establishing best environmental practice.  While the study is a preliminary study it will inform the development of the terms of reference for a much more detailed research study to be commissioned by the EPA later this year.  The terms of reference for this more extensive research are currently being drawn up by a steering group including representatives from the EPA and my Department.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the further research to be commissioned by the EPA will assist in a robust scientific based assessment of any future application proposing the use of this technology.  I can confirm, however, that until there has been time to consider the second stage of the EPA research, the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised.  My policy approach is therefore one of encouraging investment in exploration, while ensuring all exploration and production activities are carried out in a safe manner and without significant adverse environmental or social impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":337,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 121 and 122 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services Provision","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO01250"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[44021\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100051#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when he expects the telecommunications sector in this country to achieve comparable status in terms of speed, efficiency and modernisation with the best available throughout Europe or globally; the steps necessary to achieve this objective; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>The provision of electronic communications services is, in the first instance, a matter for competing service providers operating in Ireland&#8217;s fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The telephony market is served by a variety of commercial fixed line, wireless and mobile providers.  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives in the provision of broadband to bring service to those parts of the country where operators have not offered services on a commercial basis.  In the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), for example, services are available from the NBS service provider, 3, in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) where a lack of broadband access had been identified.

The policy contains measures to ensure that the management of waste will be in accordance with the waste hierarchy, as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, whereby prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery are favoured to the disposal of waste. Maximising the resources recovered from waste is a central principle of the policy.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, financing the environmentally sound management of waste electrical and electronic equipment, including recycling, is solely a producer responsibility. Waste destined for recovery\/recycling is, subject to environmental controls, a freely tradable commodity and cannot be directed into indigenous facilities. Approved bodies are however required to consider the impact their operations have on climate change, on the reduction of greenhouse gases by minimising transport and how Ireland can secure credit for savings in CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions that derive from recycling activity. It is my understanding that part of the business strategies of both Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and ERP Ireland, is to provide commercially viable solutions for their members that support local service providers for the treatment of WEEE wherever possible. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government&#8217;s new waste policy contains measures to improve the quality of recycling and resource recovery from waste and thus provide greater opportunities for Irish industry to exploit this resource. While we must accept that our relative size will place some limits on the scope for a comprehensive recycling infrastructure, I fully support efforts to reduce our dependence on overseas recycling operations and provide local facilities with local employment that can provide cost effective solutions to WEEE producers. <\/p><p><br \/>  To this end, as part of the review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) agreements, I have requested an examination of all further measures which could be undertaken to support the development of indigenous reprocessing capacity for PRI waste, as well as the issue of a reuse policy for Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Reuse, and the preparation for reuse of Electrical and Electronic Equipment, has the potential to deliver environmental, economic and social benefits. This review is at an advanced stage and I look forward to considering its recommendations with regard to the development of an indigenous recycling industry that respects the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100054#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Funding","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100054#WRR00925"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[43999\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100054#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide the necessary funding for the replacement of water mains in the Mid Kerry regional water supply, County Kerry as a matter of urgency (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>Substantial funding towards local authorities&rsquo; water conservation programmes is being provided under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013.

The European Commission adopted the implementing rules for Control Regulation in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404\/2011. These regulations set out the detailed requirements and obligations for the operation of an EU Electronic Logbooks (ERS) system and the procedures to be adhered to in the event that the system is not fully functioning.<\/p><p>  The introduction of ERS allows the Irish Fisheries Control Authority near real time access to the fishing logbook information of EU and Third Country fishing vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone. This data is made available by the Flag Member State on request when the fishing vessel is fishing in Irish waters or is provided on landing into an Irish port.<\/p><p>  With the advent of ERS the Sea Fisheries Protection Authorities (SFPA) have been working with the Control Authorities of the Member States whose vessels operate in Irish Waters to provide that the relevant ERS data is made available through the European Commission Data Exchange Highway (DEH). The DEH is the channel through which Member States exchange ERS data and Ireland has been connected to the DEH since 2011. This process involves a significant amount of testing between all the relevant parties to ensure the logbook data exchange can take place and it is only when the testing is completed satisfactorily that data is allowed to be exchanged in the &ldquo;Live&rdquo; environment. At present Ireland is conducting testing with the Spanish Authorities on the exchange of ERS data through the DEH and significant progress has been made to date.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, there remain obligations on all Member States, including Spain, to provide Ireland with ERS logbook data by alternate means. Following several bilateral meetings the Irish and Spanish Authorities have put a system in place that allows for the exchange of logbook data between both parties to ensure that the logbook data required under the EU Regulation is available in near real time. This alternative system involves the direct exchange of logbook data between the Irish and Spanish Fisheries Monitoring Centres rather than using the DEH. In effect this means that the fishing logbook information of all Spanish fishing vessels operating in the Irish EEZ or landing into Irish Ports is available to the Irish Authorities electronically on request in near real time. While this alternative system is of practical use, Ireland continues to work closely with the authorities of Spain to ensure the full system is in place as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100055#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Conditions","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100055#WRT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[43936\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100055#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the criteria for new entrants to the agri environment options scheme, with particular reference to farmers who were previously in REPS 3; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":475,"content":"<p>The re-opened Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS) which I announced recently with funding of &euro;20m will operate largely on the same basis as in previous years with much the same measures and the same payment rates.

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.<\/p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. <\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding.   <\/p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  <\/p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. <\/p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  <\/p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100055#WRU01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100055#WRU01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Investigations","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100055#WRU01550"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[43898\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100055#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to work with the recently formed Acknowledgement Forum in Northern Ireland to look into issues of alleged illegal adoptions of children from the south into families in the north; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>An Investigation and Inquiry into Historical Institutional Abuse has been established by the Northern Ireland Executive.

The European Commission adopted the implementing rules for Control Regulation in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404\/2011. These regulations set out the detailed requirements and obligations for the operation of an EU Electronic Logbooks (ERS) system and the procedures to be adhered to in the event that the system is not fully functioning.<\/p><p>  The introduction of ERS allows the Irish Fisheries Control Authority near real time access to the fishing logbook information of EU and Third Country fishing vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone. This data is made available by the Flag Member State on request when the fishing vessel is fishing in Irish waters or is provided on landing into an Irish port.<\/p><p>  With the advent of ERS the Sea Fisheries Protection Authorities (SFPA) have been working with the Control Authorities of the Member States whose vessels operate in Irish Waters to provide that the relevant ERS data is made available through the European Commission Data Exchange Highway (DEH). The DEH is the channel through which Member States exchange ERS data and Ireland has been connected to the DEH since 2011. This process involves a significant amount of testing between all the relevant parties to ensure the logbook data exchange can take place and it is only when the testing is completed satisfactorily that data is allowed to be exchanged in the &ldquo;Live&rdquo; environment. At present Ireland is conducting testing with the Spanish Authorities on the exchange of ERS data through the DEH and significant progress has been made to date.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, there remain obligations on all Member States, including Spain, to provide Ireland with ERS logbook data by alternate means. Following several bilateral meetings the Irish and Spanish Authorities have put a system in place that allows for the exchange of logbook data between both parties to ensure that the logbook data required under the EU Regulation is available in near real time. This alternative system involves the direct exchange of logbook data between the Irish and Spanish Fisheries Monitoring Centres rather than using the DEH. In effect this means that the fishing logbook information of all Spanish fishing vessels operating in the Irish EEZ or landing into Irish Ports is available to the Irish Authorities electronically on request in near real time. While this alternative system is of practical use, Ireland continues to work closely with the authorities of Spain to ensure the full system is in place as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100056#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Conditions","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100056#WRT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[43936\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100056#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the criteria for new entrants to the agri environment options scheme, with particular reference to farmers who were previously in REPS 3; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>The re-opened Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS) which I announced recently with funding of &euro;20m will operate largely on the same basis as in previous years with much the same measures and the same payment rates.

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.<\/p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards.

There is a unit in Ballydowd in Dublin, which has a capacity of 10 beds, another in Gleann &Aacute;lainn in Cork with a capacity of 4 beds and Coovagh House in Limerick with a capacity capped at 2 for the present time following refurbishment of the unit.<\/p><p>  Additionally, there are two National High Support Units in Ireland, Rath Na n&Oacute;g in Castleblaney and Crann&oacute;g Nua in Portrane. Currently there is a total <\/p><p>capacity of 10 beds in these two units.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive is currently implementing a capital investment programme to expand the capacity of the national high support and special care service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100057#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Welfare Board Remit","counter":699,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":700,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[43919\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 496 of 26 June 2012, if a response has issued (details supplied)","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":701,"content":"<p>I am advised that a response will issue to the Deputy in the coming days. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00325"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[43942\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline in tabular form, the amount of money allocated by her Department and agencies within her Department to Ballina, Castlebar and Westport Town Council between 1997 and 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that no funding allocations were made to the three Town Councils mentioned since my Department was established in June 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[43879\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding medical treatment abroad in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":707,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00750"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[43830\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100058#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the proposed primary care centre in Rowlagh, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, was moved from the stated funded list to the public private partnership list; the date on which this decision was taken; if the decision will have any impact on the time scale for the delivery of the project; the current date for commencement and completion of the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>The management and delivery of the health capital programme is a service matter.
