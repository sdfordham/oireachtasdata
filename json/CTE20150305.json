The draft Bill examined by this committee had a definition of \"human reproductive material\" which included an ovum or part of an ovum.  This had relevance in circumstances in which an ovum was provided but there was a background difficulty with regard to certain genetic diseases that could be inherited, such as mitochondrial deficiencies.  If a husband and wife are using their own reproductive material to conceive a child but the wife has a family history of mitochondrial deficiencies, there can be an intervention under what is now the new frontier of genetic reproductive medicine, which allows for modification of the wife's ova with no impact on the looks or personality or the overall genetic makeup of the child that is ultimately born.  A 0.1% change to the original material in the ovum using material from a donated ovum would prevent that the type of difficulty that arises from what could non-technically be described as mitochondrial disease, where the body is not able to properly digest food to create energy that is necessary.  This can have a dramatic impact on the health and welfare of children and adults in areas both mild and serious, including cardiac and respiratory issues.  This issue was addressed recently when the Westminster Parliament dealt with a deficiency in its own legislation that created a barrier to dealing with this in the context of assisted reproduction.<\/p> <p>  This is also relevant in a context in which a husband and wife have no fertility issues, in the sense that they can conceive naturally, but there is an inherited mitochondrial disease in the family.  What people may not understand is that the wife's ovum needs to be corrected in this particular way.  I am conscious that this is at the frontier of reproductive medicine.  It is something I was aware of when I prepared the draft Bill, and the reference to part of an ovum was designed to address this issue.  I am conscious that when dealing with legislation there are ten different ways one can draft something to address a problem - there is no perfect drafting methodology - and one can problem-solve with a variety of different phraseologies.  I am not sure whether there is a definitive definition.  In the context of dealing with the embryo, there is a reference to \"a human egg\" and \"a human sperm\" and there does not seem to be an recognition, as the legislation is currently drafted - I am open to correction - that one could in fact be dealing with 99.9% of an ovum derived from the wife, with the final 0.1% coming from a donated ovum, which would correct an inherited deficiency that has an impact on well-being and welfare not just for the child that is born but for generations into the future.  This is an issue that is relevant to this section and to earlier sections, and it is important that it be teased out a little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#B01600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have a proposals on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#B01700","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am interested in listening to the Minister's response on the extent to which this was considered when amendments were made to the legislation.

I do not believe there is anyone in this room, in any of the political parties or among the Independents, or anyone outside this House who would be of the view that a medical intervention that can ensure that a very serious genetically inherited physiological difficulty is corrected should not be carried out.  In the context of the hearings that this committee held - I followed them with great interest, and a very interesting report was produced - I am not aware of anyone mentioning a problem with regard to the definitions that were used.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty with the Bill is that it is dealing with aspects of reproduction.  What the Bill was originally intended to do was to identify parentage in the area of assisted reproduction.  It is doing that in a variety of ways.  A different formula is being adopted, and we will come to that shortly.  I must say, frankly, that there are issues in this Bill that I envisaged would have been dealt with as part of a consultative process that the Minister of Health would undertake.  Why that consultative process did not occur earlier is a mystery to me, because it was my understanding that it would have commenced fairly shortly after the heads of the Bill were published in January 2014.  The Bill seems to be dealing with some aspects of reproduction, and in fact - I am coming back specifically to the issue - it is dealing with some areas that it probably should not be dealing with and omitting other areas that it should be dealing with.  The point is that there are rules and specifics in the Bill with regard to whether anonymous donors are allowed or not allowed, and I am not sure whether we have touched on that.  Yet the Bill seems to be progressing at a great rate this morning without the sections being examined beyond amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#B02100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Everybody has their chance to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#B02200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p><p>There has not been adequate consultation on what is effectively the banning of anonymous donors in the context of assisted reproduction.  Currently, the overwhelming majority of couples who engage in assisted reproduction using donor sperm or ova are entirely dependent on anonymous donation.  There is a risk that this legislation, while providing for a recognition of the parentage of children born through assisted reproduction, will mean that a majority of parents with fertility issues who need assistance through donation will need to go abroad.  It will create another Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The issue of anonymous donation should have been part of the consultative process in which the Department of Health is engaged.  I do not know why it is now in this Bill without the extensive consultation that was required.<\/p><p> With regard to the issues of parentage and consent to the use of embryos in further DAHR procedures, we are talking about, to take a simple example, a couple who have not used an embryo created from their own reproductive material and are now agreeing that it can be used to assist another couple.  Perhaps this is a conversation that should have taken place on an earlier section.  However, it is relevant to this section and to the definition of ovum that is applicable to determining what is an embryo in the context of the legislation.  I have been part of this process and I have been on both sides of the divide in this committee, both as Minister and as an ordinary Member of the House.  There is no reason for us to enact a definition that is now recognised by our neighbouring Parliament to be out of date.  There is no reason for us to exclude the possibility in the area of assisted reproduction for couples who have fertility difficulties, and for those who do not but who want to correct an inherited deficiency that could have an impact on the life and welfare of the child to be born to them.  There is no reason for not ensuring that we have an adequate definition that addresses this issue.  This is not an issue of major complexity.  I ask the Minister on Report Stage to look at the definition that is being used and to go back and examine the definition that was framed in the heads of the Bill as discussed by this committee.<\/p><p> I appreciate that the architecture of the Bill has been amended and, knowing how the system works, I do not doubt that some of that change was derived from the Attorney General's office.  Without revealing too many secrets that I should not reveal, I can tell Members that during my three years as Minister there was many an occasion on which I had to engage in arm wrestling with the drafters in the Attorney General's office to ensure the legislation emerged out of that office in the form I wanted to see it.  It seems to me there is a risk that this legislation is going to create a block, if the Minister introduces the provisions on anonymous donation any time soon, on assisted donor reproduction occurring at all in this country for the vast majority of individuals.  We are at risk of creating a block on what I would describe as a crucial health intervention.<\/p><p> It is important to know where we are coming from.  This area is currently unregulated.  I agree that it is an issue for the Department of Health to introduce regulation for fertility clinics and, frankly, to introduce regulations or laws to deal with the issue of anonymous or non-anonymous donation, but why would we now change something and create a difficulty that does not currently exist?  If someone is able to avail of this advance in reproductive medicine in this country today, why enact legislation that might, when it comes into force, create a block that does not currently exist?  That is the point I want to make.  We know from what the Minister for Health has said that there is no possibility that legislation dealing with the areas he is addressing will come before the Oireachtas and be enacted before the next election.  It has taken decades for us in this State to deal with this matter.  There is very little chance, whatever new Government comes into office in 2016, that the matter will be prioritised for revisiting by the Minister for Health.  We should not create this difficulty.  We should not leave parents in this State with a family history of mitochondrial disease in a position in which the only way they can have that corrected is by travelling to England.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#B02300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond to Deputy Shatter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#C00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>As I have stated, much work has taken place in the Department of Health in recent weeks and months, as evidenced by the fact that the Minister for Health brought a recommendation to Cabinet for the heads of a Bill on assisted human reproduction to be developed.  That is a very significant development.  He has also announced wider AHR consultation, which is also important, as there is much on which to consult in this area.  We have the recommendation made by the commission in 2005 for a regulatory authority, which is certainly needed.  In this Bill we are dealing with certain aspects of AHR, but we are not dealing with the wider issues; we are dealing with parentage issues.  I see the particular point raised as being very relevant to that wider debate and that wider consultation.  The Department of Health feels very strongly that there are many ethical issues involved.  Its policy is single-egg only and it is not addressing the issue of mitochondrial disease.  The UK, which has recently legislated on this matter, is the only country to have done so.  Many of the issues that arise are more appropriately dealt with in the wider AHR legislation and consultation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to anonymous donation, I wish to make a number of points.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child speaks about the importance of the child's having access to its own genetic information, and that is the reason we have taken this approach.  It clearly is in the interests of the child that it would have access to genetic information.  This is best practice internationally and is what other countries have done.  They have moved from anonymous donation.  Obviously there are still some countries where there is anonymous donation, and there is a history in Ireland of using both anonymous and non-anonymous donation.  This Bill makes it clear that we are moving to a situation of best practice in terms of donations and that they will be known.  We have gone further and have talked about the type of detail that will have to be kept by the clinics.  We are talking about the consent issues and the access of the child, when he or she reaches the age of 18, to that information.  All of that is dealt with in the legislation on the basis of the right of the child to access its genetic identity.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the concerns of some of the clinics, I want to reassure them that there will be a transitional period.  Much work remains to be done in terms of working out the detail of this regulation, the consent issues and the various other aspects that are addressed in the Bill.  There will be ample opportunity for the clinics to engage, primarily with the Department of Health, on this issue.  In fact, the Department of Health will hold a stakeholder meeting in the next few weeks in order to work with the clinics and discuss these issues.  I am absolutely clear that the principle outlined in the Bill is the right one in the context of children and going forward with AHR in this country.  There are transitional issues that have to be dealt with, and they will be dealt with, but the principle and the policy are right and they are in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the discussions in the committee, as well as the recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children.  Sweden moved to this system 20 years ago.  The international experience is that there can be a reduction in donations initially, but as the legislation becomes known and as people understand it this issue can be dealt with. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#C00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>If I may return on that point, I will be brief.  I very much support and have always supported the concept that in so far as is practical and possible children should be able to trace their origins.  That is a fairly basic principle.  We have failed abysmally to address that issue adequately in the area of adoption.<\/p><p>This is because of the constitutional issues and difficulties that arose in marrying the rights of children with the right to privacy of individuals who placed children for adoption at a time when no legislation on origin tracing existed.  Donation, whether of sperm or eggs, is a complicated and more difficult issue.  There is a diversity of different approaches worldwide.  Some states have no particular rules at all.  The donor may be anonymous or not anonymous.  Some states have a mixture of rules with options for anonymous donation or identified donation.  A smaller number of states require that the donor's identity be known.<br\/><br\/>The difficulty in Ireland is that it is an extremely small country.  Our population is entirely different from that, for example, of the neighbouring jurisdiction.  I presume that members of the committee have received the letter from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  I wish to refer to one particular aspect of it.  In its letter, the institute references the circumstances and the difficulties with regard to assisted reproduction in Ireland.  I do not know if the Minister knows the number of children born through assisted reproduction by donation.  If she does, perhaps the committee should be informed of it.  We are also entitled to know what consultation the Minister engaged in with fertility clinics and those members of the medical profession who are engaged daily in assisted reproduction medicine in this country.  We should not be enacting provisions and saying that we will have a consultative process later.  It was my understanding, when the heads of the original Bill were published, that the Department of Health was first going to engage in a consultative process.  This is why these particular provisions were not in the original draft Bill.  The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists states in its letter: <blockquote>It must be realised that virtually no sperm, egg or embryo donation occurs in Ireland at present using sperm or eggs donated in Ireland.  It occurs in a handful of cases, usually involving family members or friends.  Virtually all sperm donated and used here is imported sperm, mostly from Denmark, and donor eggs used come mostly from the Ukraine.  Denmark allows anonymous or non-anonymous [donation] and the Ukraine is all anonymous.  The majority of couples having egg donation in fact travel to Spain or the Czech Republic where donation is anonymous.  This practice will undoubtedly continue for many years yet and it will take a slow cultural change for the majority of Irish heterosexual couples to move to open donation.  Many people in Ireland do not live [it says] in a tolerant or liberal community.  Recent appalling coverage in the media confirms this.<\/blockquote>I will not comment on the last bit.<br\/><br\/>I am someone who emotionally believes, as opposed to intellectually believes, that children should be able to trace their origins.  However, first, there is no certainty that individuals living in this State, in circumstances in which they have not done so to date, will, in the future, when donation is non-anonymous, provide the necessary donations to facilitate Irish couples in conceiving where there are fertility issues.  Second, it is unenforceable legislation in any case.  Until there is a united global approach, or at a minimum a united European approach, in this area, those who wish to conceive by anonymous donation will simply get on the plane and they will conceive.  Third, even though all of us instinctively feel that children should be able to trace their origins, the truth and the reality is that the children concerned, and it might sound tough to say this, would not be born or exist in many instances without anonymous donation.  It is a question of a balanced and rational approach that needs to be applied.<br\/><br\/>I am aware of what the UN and other organisations have said.  However, we now live in a remarkably different world.  One reason for recording information about donors or knowing information, for example, about the background of the biological parent or parents of an adopted child was so that its origins could be traced.  The Minister referred to the second reason, which is that individuals would have some knowledge of heritable health difficulties they could suffer as a consequence of the genetic make-up of their biological parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#C00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>It might be helpful to keep to the sections as they arise.

Unless they are required, be they in Ireland, Denmark or the United States, to provide details of their medical history annually, how their vulnerabilities develop and what their medical history is may not be known until they are in their 50s, 60s or 70s.

This is the reason all best practice suggests that all of the information about the donor should be made available to the child at a later stage.  The intention is that as much medical history and information as possible would be made available.  If we move from anonymous donation to known donation, the donor is making the decision in a different way because he or she is making it with the knowledge that the information is going to be made available when the child is 18 years of age.  This, as well as the question of ongoing provision of information, changes the perspective and the decision the person is making.<\/p> <p>  Many of these issues are related to the broader discussion on AHR.

My understanding of the structure of the Bill is that any parent to whom a child has been born by use of assisted reproduction by donor up to the time when the Bill becomes operative, and who wants the child to be regarded as their own, must make a court application to do so.  I am talking about the straightforward situation of a husband and wife where the wife has given birth.  The original legislation had a structure where there was a presumption of parenthood and if there was a challenge to the parenthood of a child a court application could be made.  The effect of that was that, for the vast majority of individuals who had a child through assisted reproduction by donor, the child would be regarded as effectively theirs.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister again if she is aware of the number of children who have been born by assisted reproduction by donor over the past 30 years?  What work has been done to assess how many court applications could arise if the only way to establish parentage of a child born where there has been a donated sperm or ova is through the making of a court application?  What consideration has been given to the capacity of the courts to cope with that?  What consideration has been given to the difficulties that might arise if, as is likely, there are hundreds and possibly thousands of children whose parents will not make this application as the children may already be adults or no longer be living in this country?  Issues with parentage could arise on the death of a parent where there is a succession dispute.  Will the fact that a person did not apply create a difficulty and will there be some measures in the Bill to address the consequences of this?  <\/p> <p>  Perhaps I misunderstand the Bill but it does seem to me to envisage that where there has been a birth through assisted reproduction and a donated sperm or ova there will not be an assumption of parenthood by virtue of the fact that the couple residing together, whether they are married or a same sex couple, will require a court decision.  If the Minister wants to provide for a degree of certainty in this matter, the Bill could have both the presumption and, should problems arise later, the facility to apply for a court declaration so that a person could marry the two processes.  Removing the presumption leaves individuals vulnerable and will result in a lot of unnecessary court applications being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#E01800","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>It is true that we are not creating a presumption in the legislation.

It is relevant because there is a connection between the children to whom the sections apply and the process whereby declarations of parentage are sought in the District Court.  We sometimes think we have to invent wheels that have long since been invented in other countries.  I do not know the exact statistics but as far as I am aware, there have been many thousands conceived and born over the past 30 years as a result of assisted reproduction by donor.  Many of them are now adults getting on with their lives and not all are living in Ireland.  Members of the committee may not be aware of this but we used to have what were known as \"presumptions of paternity\".  Mothers in our law were always individuals who gave birth but the issue was often who was the father.<\/p><p>There were presumptions of paternity.  If a married woman gave birth to a child, the presumption was that her husband was the father.  Now we are living in a more complex world of assisted reproduction where children are being conceived by donated ova and sperm.  In other jurisdictions they move from presumptions of paternity to presumptions of parentage and the architecture used in the draft Bill provided for presumptions of parentage and was based on international precedence that had worked well in a variety of other countries.  It was not a reinvention of a wheel that does not work; it was the transplanting of a wheel into our legislation that has proved to work well.<\/p><p> The Minister has said that presumptions of parentage are taken out of the Bill.  In the context of couples who have fertility issues in the context of using donated sperm or ova, or even now, in the context of the issue I raised previously, where one may need a small intervention in a married woman's ova or in a gay woman's ova to correct an inherited difficulty, presumptions of parentage become a lot more important.  I do not understand why presumptions of parentage are taken out of the Bill.  I genuinely do not understand it.  Happily, it has nothing to do with the Department of Health.  It is to provide some degree of certainty as to the parentage of children in circumstances where issues might arise.  It is a good idea that one not only has the presumption, but that the parents of a child, or the child himself or herself, has the facility to make application to the court to get a declaration of parentage but that was always in the draft Bill.<\/p><p> We currently have in our law provisions that derive from the Status of Children Act 1987 where one can make application to the courts for declarations as to parentage or paternity.  I urge the Minister to reintroduce the presumptions on Report Stage.  It is a serious issue.  I do not think one can say one will only recognise that the people who have cared for a child born through assisted reproduction throughout the child's life are the true parents of the child if they make a court application and get a court declaration.  If that invitation is taken up and if presumptions are not in the Bill, there could be thousands of applications taken to our courts which could be snowed under in trying to deal with them, albeit I appreciate they may not be contested applications.  The volume of those applications could be enormous.  There is also the blindingly obvious issue of should individuals incur legal costs in having to make those applications where there is no inter family dispute as to who the child is and who should be regarded as his or her parents and there is no conflict as to whether the parents consented to the use of assisted reproduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#E02000","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>We have strayed into sections 19 and 20 which are related.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#F00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I promise I will not repeat all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#F00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987 is still in place with all of the presumptions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#F00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>To assist-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#F00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I will allow the Deputy back in again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#F00600","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The legal advice was very clear that we needed a court procedure when assigning parentage retrospectively.

There are numbers of people who would use what they describe as traditional methods to effect a pregnancy in circumstances which may not involve intercourse but which may involve a donation, particularly of sperm, which would facilitate somebody becoming pregnant.  There is an issue around that and how that is to be regarded under the Bill.  Relevant to the preceding section - I did not want to hog matters in any way - is the question I asked earlier and I want to ask it again.<\/p><p>What consultation has been engaged in to date with members of the medical profession engaged in reproductive medicine and the fertility clinics with regard to the practice of assisted reproduction by donor continuing in this State should these provisions be introduced?

I do not believe that these sections in this Bill should be enacted in the context of maybe we will engage in a consultative process later or the Department of Health will do it.  Either there has been a consultative process and the problems that I have described have been addressed, and what is stated here by the Minister disagrees with what is stated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the passage I read out, or, if the Minister agrees with what I read out, how is it that we are in this space where this is going ahead with these provisions in it that were not part of the original consultative process and without, as it seems to me, an adequate consultative process having occurred?

That consultative process would appropriately be dealt with, without upsetting members of this committee, by the health committee because it uniquely requires looking at some medical issues and availabilities.

These provisions have been carefully designed to allow the assignment of parentage in limited and specified circumstances.  A requirement that the treatment takes place in a clinical context is an important element of the safeguards included.  If wider provision were made for the assignment of parentage other than on the basis of genetic connection, this obviously would have significant consequences for the positions of natural fathers, for example.<\/p><p>There are several difficulties with Deputy Mac Lochlainn's proposal even if consents can be taken in broadly the same way as envisaged in sections 4, 9, and 11 of the Bill.  In particular, it will not be possible to have independent verification that the child was born through a donor assisted human reproduction procedure and it will, therefore, not be possible to provide the necessary certificate under section 25(5).  That certificate is essential to enable a couple to jointly register as the parents of a donor-conceived child.  There would also be significant difficulty in ensuring that the safeguards allowing revocation of consent by a donor can be properly implemented.  The case law on the position of a donor in cases of self-insemination is to be found in the Supreme Court judgment in the case of McD <i>v<\/i>. L.  This found that the man concerned was, in law, the child's father and had the same statutory rights to seek guardianship, custody,and access as another non-marital father.<\/p><p>The Bill does not attempt to regulate this issue or, for example, to ban it.  It has the consequences though in relation to parentage as set out in section 5.  However, where all of the adults involved are in agreement and it is in the best interest of the child concerned, there are options available which will allow a non-biological parent to secure a legal relationship with the child.  That person could apply for guardianship of the child under section 6(<i>c<\/i>) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 45 of the Bill, leaving the parental status of the natural father unaffected.  Alternatively, of course, the mother and her partner could jointly adopt the child under the Adoption Act 2010 as it is proposed to be amended by this Bill.<\/p><p>In short, they will have a route to parentage which does not run the risk of undermining the position of natural fathers.

The way the Bill is constructed is to ensure that where there is that transition from the donor to parentage, there is a very clear route outlined for all involved so that the rights of everyone are protected, the donor and the parents.  What we have done in the Bill is that we have outlined clear routes to parentage but we have the safeguards of where the procedures are taking place and the independent verification of them.

That is what primarily has determined the approach regarding the child's right to genetic information.

There has been ongoing consultation between the Department of Health and the relevant clinics and their submissions have also been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#H00900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Unless I am missing something, it appears to me that the Minister is stating that neither she nor her Department has been engaged with the fertility clinics and that they have not considered the difficulty that could arise if we move from anonymous donation to identifying donors.  No assessment has been undertaken as to whether a barrier will now be erected when this comes into force and will be placed in the way of couples who wish to conceive in Ireland through assisted reproduction by donor.  I apologise but this is too important an issue.  This legislation is designed to do something that has been ignored for too long in this country, that is, to provide rules with regard to parentage of children born through assisted reproduction.  Unfortunately, the issue of surrogacy effectively has been abandoned to whoever is in government the next time around.<\/p> <p>  However, one should not do something that has unintended consequences.  I accept absolutely that the Minister does not intend these consequences.  I accept absolutely that this is a well-intentioned approach to ensure that children can have information with regard to biological parents, that is, the donors.  I accept absolutely the intentions behind this are well-intentioned and would not wish anyone to misinterpret what I am saying.  I believe the necessary consultation on this matter has not occurred and that it will have unintended consequences.  I believe it will greatly stress couples who have personal fertility issues and will create a difficulty for the continued work on existing fertility clinics.  Moreover, I do not think it is good enough, for example, to state that while the measure will be enacted, it will not be brought into force instantly but that the Government will then engage in a consultative process.  There must be some certainty in this environment for both couples and members of the medical profession as to the direction they are taking over the next period of time.<\/p> <p>  I wish to give one simple example in this regard.  At present, there are couples throughout the country who are having difficulties in conceiving.  They will be getting some medical assistance and, inevitably, will be attempting to conceive without assisted reproduction.  The next stage may well be that they will attempt to conceive through assisted reproduction by use of their own reproductive material.  The third step, if that does not work, may be by donor.  In circumstances in which couples may have some reasonable prospect of conceiving by use of their own material without donor, will members, because these provisions are coming down the track, put them in a position where, if they wish to go through assisted reproduction in Ireland, they must forget about that and must conceive rapidly through anonymous donation for fear that in six, 12 or 18 months' time, there simply will not be donors in this country and their only alternative option will be to leave the State?  Are we going to put couples in that position?<\/p> <p>  It is too serious to simply state there will be a consultative process later on and it is unfair.  I acknowledge the Minister's amendments in this area are well-intentioned.  I am totally familiar with the international legal provisions to which she is making reference and am aware of the recommendation of this committee.  However, while I am open to correction by members, I do not think the committee explored whether, if we did what is now proposed, it could have the unintended consequence of bringing to an end for a time assisted reproduction by donor in Ireland.  I do not believe any member of this committee envisaged that unintended consequence as a possibility.  Moreover, I do not think one should simply ignore what the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is saying about this issue.  I urge the Minister to rethink the presence of the provisions contained in this section and related sections.  I will not come back and repeat this but I urge the Minister to rethink the appropriateness of their inclusion in this Bill with a view to what she states should occur, that is, the engagement of the Department of Health in a consultative process and these elements of this Bill being removed from it on Report Stage.  Let the Department of Health get on with its consultative process, which is the area in which it should be dealing and not on the issue of parentage in the context of surrogacy.

While I clearly desire to have a system that is effective and that works, there are a couple of key principles, one of them being a move from anonymous to known donation.  I already have spoken about that.  As I stated, there is not evidence available from elsewhere that in the longer term, this has been a problem in countries which have moved in this direction.

If the legislation as put forward by the Minister is enacted it would apply to people who engage for the first time in the process, but the intention is to take a compassionate approach to those who have already engaged in the process in recent years in order that would be allowed to complete the cycle.  That is the advice we have been given.  We are hopeful the Minister will accept it as it is a very reasonable amendment.  It is a compassionate amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#J00800","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The amendment would provide for a transition period to allow couples currently undertaking donor-assisted human reproduction procedures to continue with their treatment and to facilitate an orderly move to the regulatory framework envisaged in Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill.  In principle, I broadly agree that such a transitional period has its merits and I stress in that regard certain transitional provisions are already included in section 20(5) and 20(6) of section.  The Deputy's provision in the proposed section 24(10) would to some extent cut across the provisions set out in 20(6) which sets out a three year period from the commencement date to allow the couple to have a sibling using gametes from the same anonymous donor.  That is a very specific section to deal with the issue of siblings.<\/p> <p>  As an alternative to the amendment, I propose to give a clear commitment to the Deputy, together with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, that Parts 2 and 3 will not be commenced for a minimum period of one year from the date of enactment and that would provide at least the same transition period which would enable couples currently undergoing treatment to continue with that treatment and will give clinics time to prepare for the new regulatory framework.  This is a practical and pragmatic administrative solution to which I will give a binding commitment so that we will have a seamless transition to the new regulatory framework.

It is section 24(5).  It provides for a period of three years from the date on which that subsection comes into operation, a gamete to which paragraph (a) of that subsection does not apply may be used, basically, in an assisted human reproduction procedure.  Then it goes through a whole series of issues.<\/p> <p>  The three years is the problem.  I am going to ask the Minister to amend that on Report Stage because in circumstances where there is frozen material available to be utilised in assisted reproduction, that could be used over many years.  In the context of that, it does not make sense that it is confined to a three-year period.  For example, where a couple has an arrangement or where material is available, will it be the case that if one wants to have children, one had better have three in three years?<\/p> <p>  I do not understand the three-year provision.  It creates unnecessary difficulties.  Could the Minister clarify if, for example, this were to apply to an embryo, if a number of embryos were created - I understand it will apply - let us assume there are five frozen embryos that a husband and wife can utilise to conceive a child and a donor has been involved with regard to the material required to create the embryos, are we going to say to them, first, any ones that can be utilised to conceive must be done within three years of the enactment of the Bill because the donor was anonymous?  That makes no sense.  There is no merit in it and I would suggest that should be revisited.<\/p><p> When replying in respect of Deputy Mac Lochlainn's amendment, the Minister indicated that Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill will not be brought into force for a minimum of one year and possibly longer.  I am of the view that Part 3 should be removed from the legislation entirely.  The difficulty with Part 2 is that it contains provisions relating to identifying the children born through assisted reproduction.  I am quite happy that the provisions which should have been left to the Department of Health to deal with in the first instance will not be brought into force for a minimum of one year.  I suspect that some of them will never be brought into force in their current state.<\/p><p> There is an urgent need to make specific rules in respect of the area of parentage.  Under the enabling provision in the legislation, at section 1(3), the Minister \"may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to a particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions\".  Basically, this means that he or she may bring different sections into operation.  There is an urgent need to provide clarity with regard to the parentage of children born through assisted reproduction.  It is bad enough that we are leaving out children born by means of surrogacy, particularly in the context of the number of court cases which have taken place to date on that issue and the number of parents and children affected.  We should not be saying that we are not going to provide clarity for children who are born via assisted reproduction for a minimum of one year and possibly longer.<\/p><p> I do not want the Minister to be in a position in the future where when she wishes to bring certain sections into operation, she will be of the view that she has made a pledge not to do so.  I hope that when the legislation is enacted, the provisions which offer clarity regarding parentage will be brought into force.  Even though I disagree with the necessity for individuals to be obliged to go before the courts to obtain orders or declarations of parentage which indicate that their parents consensually agreed to use assisted reproduction by donor, we should postpone the possibility of their being able to do so for a minimum or possibly a good deal longer.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the blanket promise to the effect that Part 2 will not be brought into force for at least a year.  The parentage identity provision should be implemented immediately.<\/p><p> I welcome the fact that Part 3 will not be brought into force for at least one year.  It would be preferable if the matter to which it relates were dealt with by the Department of Health.  Whatever the position, the three-year provision in section 24(5) must be revisited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#J02200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>It is important that I make absolutely clear the fact that embryos are permanently exempted.  I will be introducing a further provision on Report Stage to clarify the position even further.  For constitutional and other reasons - but mainly constitutional ones - embryos are permanently exempted from this provision.  Even if the donation is anonymous, it will be permanently exempted.  I wish to make that point perfectly clear to the Deputy.  Parts 2 and 3 are inextricably linked because they set out in the Bill the whole approach we believe is necessary in the context of identity.

That is regrettable.  I do not believe there was a necessity to mix these issues up in this particular way.  I urge the Minister to reconsider what is being done here.  If she insists on going down the road of including in the Bill measures which would more properly be dealt with under legislation relating to the Department of Health and which are clearly recognised as creating a difficulty in the context of assisted reproduction by donation, then the issues to which I refer should be separated from the rules relating to parentage.  They are of no relevance at all to the thousands of children already born by means of anonymous donation for whom a court procedure is being provided in order that they might definitively identify who are their parents so that their parentage will not be a matter of dispute in the future.  It is regrettable that the issues in question have become interwoven in the way I have outlined.  I make these points because it has taken us 30 years to get to the point of enacting legislation in this area.  I urge the Minister to examine the architecture of the Bill in order that the parentage of children born to date can at least be readily determined, addressed and dealt with and to ensure that matters will not be left in limbo for a minimum of one year and possibly longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#K00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>In developing the provisions contained in the Bill, many different aspects had to be taken into consideration.

It again illustrates why this aspect of this legislation should be dealt with by the Department of Health and should not be in this Bill.  What is becoming clearer as we are having this discussion is that these provisions in this Bill will create a blockage on reforms relating to identifying the parentage of children born through assisted reproduction for heterosexual couples or gay couples across the country and that there is no certainty as to when any of the provisions in Parts 2 or 3 will come into force.<\/p> <p>  The reason it is important is because the architecture is making the presentation that this is a function that the Minister for Health is personally going to perform or his officials.

I believe that instead of a contact register being set up in this area for children who are born as a result of the donor-assisted human reproduction procedure, as in the case of children born naturally, a no-contact veto provision should be provided.  As much information as possible should be provided both on the donor side and on the side of the child who was born as a result of the donor-assisted human reproduction procedure.  That information should be on a register in as much detail as I would be advocating in terms of the adoption information and tracing legislation, so that either the donor or the child could register.  They would have to give this information but they could put in a no-contact veto provision stating that they do not wish to be contacted, rather than an application having to be sent to the Minister or whoever seeking the information and the Minister having to check what is on the file.  The Minister mentioned that there would be a stakeholders' meeting after this and she mentioned time and again the role of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should certainly be brought into this discussion on this area as well.  If the information on the tracing legislation goes through, and I hope it goes through in this D&aacute;il term, and if the Minister takes up my suggestion about including a no-contact veto provision, there would then be a difference between children and adults who are born as a result of the donor-assisted human reproduction procedure and children who are born naturally.

All possible information about the birth mother or birth parents and the child who was adopted should be on the register.  In a case where a child, on reaching a certain age, or a birth mother would contact the register of adoptions seeking information to see if there is corresponding information there, and the information from both sides would be on the register for health and various other reasons, if the birth mother did not want to be contacted by her child at any stage, she could put a no-contact veto provision on the register.  Her information, details about herself, her medical history and other information she might want to provide would be on the register, but instead of that person being contacted and advised by the Adoption Authority that their child wants to contact them, and a certain time being allowed for that person to respond, that person, either the adult child or the birth parent, could put on the register that they do not wish to be contacted.

There is obviously an interaction between subsection (2) and subsection (3), in that under subsection (2) the Minister must within 12 weeks from the date on which notice was sent release to the child the information requested unless the relevant donor makes representations to the Minister setting out how it would affect the safety or well-being of the donor or the donor-conceived child or both.  It seems to be an issue of safety or well-being.  I do not know in legal terms what the phraseology \"well-being\" means.  I have absolutely no idea what it means.  The meaning of \"safety\" is reasonably clear but I do not know about \"well-being\".  In the context of the donor, should the well-being solely relate to the donor or to anyone associated with the donor, such as children born to him by a partner, whose well-being needs to be considered in all of this?  I simply do not know the answer to this.<\/p> <p>  Subsection (3) states the Minister shall consider these representations and if satisfied sufficient reasons exist to withhold the information, may do so.  The words \"well-being\" and \"sufficient reasons\" are not adequate.  As the child will be over 18, will the best interests principle be applicable or some other principle because the child at that point will be an adult?  In the context of the adoption legislation and the difficulties around tracing origin and giving information, the paramount consideration when making a decision about revealing information was the welfare of the child.  We now use, correctly, the formula \"best interests\".<\/p> <p>  These provisions are very unclear.  It is not clear whether the Minister must state the reasons he or she makes a decision.  There should be an obligation to expressly state what the reasons are.  It is not clear procedurally.  For example, if the donor objects, will the Minister have in front of him or her an application for information and a donor objection?  Will any of the information contained in the objection be furnished to the now adult child?  I do not know the answer to this.  Will the child have an opportunity to respond?  I am not clear on this.  Will any fair procedures apply?  I do not know.<\/p> <p>  In the context of an appeal there should be an obligation that the court knows the exact basis on which the Minister has withheld information.  Presumably whatever document is furnished to the Minister by the donor will have to go to the court.  We cannot have a court process where an adult child makes an application without the adult child knowing what it is he or she will confront.  Some form of the objection will have to be given to the child, even if it is redacted to exclude the name and identity of the individual who has raised objection.  I am not sure why we are doing it in the Circuit Court, other than Circuit Court judges often behave better than some of our District Court judges do in giving time to deal with family cases and family issues.  This is a serious practical problem but it is another day's issue.  There are problems and this has not been fully thought out.  There are difficulties with it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister must make a decision within 12 weeks and release the information.  This cannot take place until a child is 18.  If the notice goes out to an address of the donor that the donor gave at the time he donated sperm, who is to know whether the donor receives the information?  Is there any provision to ensure this will be sent to an up-to-date address?  There are issues which need to be teased out.  I do not want to go on at any greater length, but I am not sure how well this has been thought out.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about how legal costs will be dealt with.  Let us say the Minister makes a decision to turn down an application.  Subsection (3) states an appeal on notice to the Minister will be held otherwise than in public.  Will notice to the Minister make the Minister a defendant in the proceedings?  Let us presume I am a 20 year old who wants to obtain this information, and on the basis of something the donor has said, the Minister makes a decision I should not get information.  Could I find myself in a Circuit Court application with the Minister represented by senior and junior counsel and either representing myself or being represented by a solicitor?  What legal costs will arise in this process?  This is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  The provision also states it will be heard otherwise than in public.  This goes completely against the tenor and new ethos of the courts legislation enacted in 2013, under which family law cases or family applications can now be reported but anonymity of the people is preserved.  There is a residual right on the court to exclude reportage in particular circumstances.  The media have not taken it up in the manner I would have hoped they would, but some of what happens behind what used to be the closed doors of a family court is now getting some fresh air and there is some insight and limited transparency.  There is no particular reason the same rule should not apply here.  If there are issues around the circumstances in which information will be made available, and the anonymity of the parties needs to be preserved, information on the donor and information on birthdates should not come into the public domain, but the manner in which these applications are dealt with in the family courts and the family Circuit Court, which I presume will deal with it, should not be any more anonymous than any other type of family case.  With transparency there is greater public insight into how the courts approach matters and greater insight by Members of the House as to whether laws are not working as anticipated and need to be changed.  I query this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#R00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The main point on this provision is it is seen as applying in very exceptional cases.

My legal advice is it can be done in the way I have outlined.  It is not the best interest principle, in the sense we are building it in as a basic right for the child to information.<\/p><p>We have done this for the reasons I have already mentioned.

I am very conscious of, and I want to come back to this, the desirability where possible of facilitating individuals born through assisted reproduction or through adoption to trace origins, but one has to have a robust and coherent procedure and there has to be a prescription as to how it is going to work.  The Minister has not replied as to whether it is envisaged a Minister who turns down an application would effectively be the defendant or the respondent in these applications and would play a role in defending the decision or whether the Circuit Court would be at large to consider it all from the perspective of what has been submitted to the court and then make a decision.  I do not know the answer to that.  Perhaps that could be clarified.<\/p> <p>  I do think it is important that there is a reasoned basis for the decision.  It is not simply that the Minister decides he or she is not going to release the information and there are no reasons given.  There is a need for this section to delineate an obligation to detail the reasons for the decision made.<\/p> <p>  I am presuming on the other side of this, as we are dealing with this, that if a decision is made by the Minister to make the information available, the donor can appeal to the Circuit Court.  Equally, where the Minister rejects the donor's objection, presumably the donor should know the reason why.  If it is a one-sided appeal, that would be a very strange procedure.  I am particularly concerned in circumstances where the appeal is not going to be dealt with, from what the Minister said, in the initial period when this legislation might be in force by a specialist body.

I do not think it is appropriate that a mechanism is created which is designed to protect safety or designed to protect \"well-being\", whatever that means, where if a decision is made not to do something, the party affected by that can appeal, but where a decision is made to do something, the party affected by that cannot appeal.<\/p> <p>  Can I put it in a political context?  Let us assume for a moment, as the Minister said, the bias would be to make information available, but when it comes to making a decision, a Minister cannot come to it with bias.  He or she must make an objective decision based on the information furnished to him or her.  Of course, one of the difficulties is how the information furnished is validated because this does not involve any form of a hearing process.  It seems to be based on some form of written submission.  That is a particular difficulty.  If it is the type of procedure that is here envisaged - not to be obtuse about it - and a 20 or 25 year old wants information or the donor does not want information provided, the Minister is the person making the decision.  It is not an independent body or authority.  Does the donor or the 25 year old conceived with the assistance of donor-assisted reproduction mechanisms start knocking on the doors of the constituency clinics of individual Deputies asking them to urge the Minister to make a particular decision or not?  If we are going to have this process, it should not be a ministerial process.  It should be a separate authority.

I mentioned that some statistics were collected by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.  They collate statistics in relation to AHR procedures conducted in European Union countries.  The majority of the Irish fertility clinics give information to the ESHRE on a voluntary basis regarding the AHR procedures they conduct, but not all of them do.  Because of the lack of legislation and regulation in this area, we cannot be absolutely definitive about the information, and it does not encompass all AHR procedures that are conducted in Ireland.  The most recent statistics available are from 2010.  Those figures show that there were seven IVF clinics in Ireland, of which six provided data for 2010.  In 2009, six out of seven clinics provided information to the ESHRE.  The data for 2010 show that there were 1,856 cycles of <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation and 1,320 of intracytoplasmic sperm injection.  In 2009 there were 1,987 cycles of IVF and 1,328 cycles of ICSI.  It should be noted that each cycle does not necessarily result in a pregnancy or the birth of a child.  The numbers relate only to IVF and ICSI and not to other AHR procedures, so we do not have exact figures for the number of children born on foot of AHR procedures in Ireland.

One of the key criticisms of the Bill that is quite widespread is the fact that it does not give automatic guardianship to the father at the time of birth.  If there are any reasons someone should not be given automatic guardianship, one assumes they can be dealt with through the courts process.<\/p><p>When an unmarried father registers his name on a birth certificate, he assumes he will be entitled to guardianship on the basis of having his name acknowledged on the birth certificate, but that is not the case.  We want to remove the conditionality in this Bill and ensure that a father who has stepped up to the plate is entitled to automatic guardianship.<\/p><p>We talk about teenage pregnancies and young men accepting responsibility as a father and all that comes with it.  Maybe the parents do not live together and are separated from the get-go but the father pays maintenance and helps with the upbringing of the child.  That is not possible in these circumstances because of the proposed legislation.  There is also the issue of fathers who have to work abroad, which is a big issue in Ireland today, and who cannot physically be there.  If the couple are not married they cannot comply with the criteria.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I ask that we work between now and Report Stage on trying to ensure there is automatic guardianship for the father, and, failing this, that the father is informed from the get-go that having his name on the birth certificate does not entitle him to automatic guardianship, and that he should seek to make a statutory declaration.  I will deal later with the issue of a central register for these declarations.  My own hope and that of my party is that there would be automatic guardianship.  Of course, if the father was not fit to be guardian, that could be dealt with through a court case.  We need full equality in parenting.  The purpose of this legislation is that it reflects the diverse nature of modern families in Ireland.  It also reflects the reality that about one third of children are born to unmarried mothers.  If all fathers were to step up to the plate, one third of them would not be given automatic guardianship.<\/p><p>So much more needs to be done in respect of the wider issue of father's rights in terms of family law and our courts system, which has families stuck in waiting rooms with other civil cases.  There are long queues, which causes distress.  It would be a good start if we were to make a clear statement that the mother and father, if they are not married, have equal guardianship rights from the get-go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#U00500","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I believe Deputy Collins also wished to speak on an amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 52.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#U00600","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

The amendment places the onus on the registrar to ensure the father is aware that the registration process is taking place, giving him an opportunity to apply for guardianship under current legislation.

As the committee is well aware, there is at present no provision in law for automatic guardianship for non-marital fathers.  The legislation will introduce such a provision for some non-marital fathers.  Under it, an unmarried father will automatically become the guardian of a child if he lives with the child's mother for at least 12 consecutive months, including three months after the child's birth.  The policy decision was taken not to extend automatic guardianship to all unmarried fathers for a variety of reasons.  Some unmarried fathers will not be involved with their children to any extent.  However, the unmarried father will be able to make a statutory declaration jointly with the mother saying that he is the guardian of the child.  That option remains for an unmarried father, as does the option for him to go to court to be given guardianship.<\/p> <p>  In the section dealing with the best interests of the child, the Bill specifies that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration for the courts in such circumstances.  I would point out to Deputies that one of a number of specified factors and circumstances that the court must take into account when determining the best interests of the child is the benefit to the child of having an ongoing meaningful relationship with each parent and sufficient contact with them to maintain such a relationship.<\/p> <p>  The legislation is the first recognition in Irish law of a mechanism for automatic guardianship of a child for a non-marital father.<\/p><p>That is the first point I want to make.<\/p><p> To reply to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, he should be aware that his amendment would delete the newly proposed provision which will make certain fathers automatically the guardians of their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#U01000","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>That is not my-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#V00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Sorry Deputy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#V00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I will explain that in a moment.

As a Deputy, I meet many fathers who do not get any or adequate access to their children, particularly if a couple does not get on.  The people may be separated, for example, and the issue is that the parents do not regularly see the children.  I know courts can make decisions in this regard.  Is there any implicit recognition in this legislation of a right to see the child?  I know there are legal issues with the likes of barring orders and so on.  One of the commonest complaints I hear from fathers is that they have nowhere to bring a child even if they have access.  Poorer families in particular might have to walk in Drogheda or Dundalk on a Saturday or Sunday or go to the back of a pub or inappropriate places.  These people want to bond with children but cannot do so in such places.  I recently visited the Tusla centre in Drogheda and there is a special room for provision.  Could the State do more to assist parents in such difficult positions?  Often, if these men are not living at home, they are living in very poor accommodation or apartment complexes.  They are often in very difficult financial circumstances.

For example, people mentioned cases of domestic violence and many called for exceptions to be made if the pregnancy was a result of rape.  A variety of circumstances were cited by Deputies who spoke on the Bill.  Many family law practitioners would have a particular concern about the issue.  Nevertheless, it is a very real area for consideration.  The approach we have taken in the Bill is to link the automatic right to cohabitation for a specific period.  It is the first time this is being dealt with in legislation.<\/p> <p>  For non-married fathers who go to court seeking guardianship, the vast majority of such requests are granted but a percentage are not granted where the courts do not consider it in the best interests of the child to have the father as a guardian.  That is because conferring guardianship has specific effects.  If a father is not on the scene or involved, his failure to exercise guardianship responsibilities has real consequences for the child and mother.  The mother would have to apply to court to dispense with the consent of the father to the issue of a passport, with related implications.  It would be extremely difficult to place the child for adoption or for the mother to adopt the child jointly with a new partner if the father did not consent to the adoption.  However, all of these issues would in such a context be very carefully considered with respect to the best interests of the child.  Other considerations would also apply.<\/p> <p>  I will go through some other concerns in detail.  If a mother decided to relocate with a child, her legal position and authority to do so would be unclear as a guardian has the right of custody within the meaning of the Hague Convention on international child abduction or the Brussels II bis regulation.  These are very vital protections where both parents are involved with the child's life, but they could be problematic for a mother and child if a father with no involvement with the child had an effective veto.  These are real and potentially serious implications of automatic guardianship, and that is not to speak of some of the other issues I discussed.<\/p> <p>  I am therefore proposing an amendment.  There is a real problem in that many fathers, especially young fathers, are not aware that they can sign a statutory declaration in front of a peace commissioner or a commissioner for oaths that would give them guardianship rights.  There is a real information deficit with this issue, and that is a clear opinion of all the non-governmental organisations working in the area and speaking about it.  A number of Deputies have raised the point and argued that it should be easier and more straightforward for fathers in that position to know their rights and be able to exercise and vindicate those rights through a statutory declaration.  That relates to cases where a mother does not object, because where there is conflict, there would be a court hearing.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I can give a further indication of the Report Stage amendment I intend to introduce, as it may be helpful to the discussion.  I have gone into some detail already.  The purpose of this Report Stage amendment relating to guardianship is to enable registers to witness a statutory declaration by which the father can be appointed a guardian at a time when a couple is registering a child's birth or within a short period afterwards.  Treoir and a number of other organisations made submissions in this regard.  This statutory declaration mechanism is easy, straightforward and inexpensive.  The principal difficulty for many non-marital parents is that most are not aware of the existence of this mechanism.  This amendment would ensure that a couple would have necessary information and can make an informed choice on whether the father should be a guardian.  Subject to legal advice, it is possible that the Report Stage amendment will amend the Civil Registration Act 2004.<\/p><p>I also plan, and will say so on Report Stage, that I will review this issue in two years time, at which time it will be possible to consider the impact of the proposals in this Bill to make it easier for non-marital fathers to complete a statutory declaration.  We can see what the result of that has been and whether we are seeing the kind of increases we would expect to see.  Many people who have looked at this area feel that the information and the access to the statutory declaration is one of the big barriers.  I believe that with the combination of initiatives in this Bill, we are moving forward substantially in regard to the rights of non-marital fathers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#X00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that her amendments Nos. 38 and 42 are part of this grouping if she wishes to discuss them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#Y00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#Y00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>She has an opportunity to comment now because once the amendment is put, we cannot go back on them again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#Y00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 38 is a minor drafting revision and I wish to move amendment No. 42.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#Y00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The Minister can move it when we reach it but we are discussing them at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#Y00600","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The Minister has suggested that she will not concede on the cohabitants rule in terms of guardianship.

That is why I do not believe this provision to be necessary.  At its core, this is a matter of equality.  Like many others, I am arguing that the mother and father should begin as equal guardians to the child.  If there is a good reason the mother objects to the father being a guardian, then she should take her case to the courts.  If she is found to be in the right, then I presume the court will not grant guardianship to the father.  The difficulty now is that the father must ask permission from the mother to be granted his equal rights.  That is not fair.  The cohabitation rule is a distraction.  The core issue is that the father must approach the mother to be granted equality.  If she agrees, then all will be well.  If she does not, however, he will be obliged to take her to court.<\/p> <p>  I feel very strongly about this matter.  As public representatives, we have all been obliged to deal with fathers who have needed to have recourse to the courts.  I accept that there are terrible fathers and men who have no right to claim the title \"father\".  However, there are also very good fathers who have been exasperated as a result of their need to undergo the legal process just to exercise their right to be parents to their children.  If we get this right, we will send a clear signal to the effect that we are of the view that mothers and fathers are equal from the outset.  If an issue arises, then the mother, or indeed the father, will be able to take a case before the courts to state that the other person involved should not have guardianship rights.  The courts, which are independent, should decide these issues.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position on the cohabitation rule and examine the possibility of granting automatic guardianship from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#Z00100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time and we stated earlier that we would suspend proceedings at 1.30 p.m.  Perhaps we will dispose of this amendment and the section before taking a break.

This seems to be the first section dealing with the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in the Bill and it seems to also be partially a definitions section.  I want to just repeat something that I said in the D&aacute;il on Second Stage.  I believe it is good legislative practice that we try to keep what is a fairly complex area as legislatively clear as possible.  I really do not understand why the Bill does not simply repeal all of the relevant provisions in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the Status of Children Act 1987 that relate to guardianship and custody of children and do what the original draft Bill did, which was incorporate all relevant provisions in the one piece of legislation.  I think that, when we are dealing with section 40, we see how additional complexities arise as a consequence of that because of the multiple amendments having to be made to the 1964 Act.  I still do not understand why that change has been effected.  The only reason I heard mentioned was in case we left something important out that was in the 1964 Act - if there is something important in the 1964 Act that needs to be retained, it could have all been retained.  If we adopted this approach to legislation, which is epitomised by section 40, we would never have enacted the Adoption Act 2010 and would have just done a series of amendments to all of the preceding adoption legislation.  We would not have enacted the Freedom of Information Act 2014, which replaces all of the previous legislation in that area.  I just do not understand why we have made this more complex than it needs be.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the specifics of the section, in so far as it is amending the 1964 Act, there are, and have been since 1964, definition deficiencies in the 1964 Act where concepts are not adequately defined.  The Law Reform Commission, when it was looking at this area of the law, recommended certain changes.  A part of the changes it recommended was a change of terminology so that we replicated here the terminology that they have adopted in England.  That is not appropriate and certainly was not appropriate after the constitutional referendum relating to children.  It is right that we retain the terminology we have, but the issues in particular that were dealt with in some of the draft legislation which are excluded - I do not understand why they are excluded - are important definitions of concepts people think they are familiar with but which are normally defined in similar legislation in nearly all the other common law jurisdictions with which I am familiar.  I want to raise these particular definitions and suggest they be incorporated by the Minister on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  The first is the concept of access.  We were discussing access previously.  There was a definition of \"access\" in the measure that this committee previously looked at, which said, \"'access', in relation to a child, includes the right of the child to maintain personal relations and contact with a parent and relatives or other person with a bona fide interest in the child on a regular basis except where such access is not in the best interests of the child\".  What that did by way of a definition which could be incorporated into section 40 as an amendment of the 1964 Act was make it clear that access was the right of a child as opposed to simply the privilege of a parent or the entitlement or right of a parent.  There have been court decisions which have described \"access\" as the right of a child.  The definition recognised that the access or contact that a child had not only included the right of the child to maintain personal relations and contact with the parent, but also with relations.  I think that is important because, when relationships collapse, all of us as public representatives learn of circumstances where, in the marital war or parental war that follows people's relationships collapsing, important people with whom a child has contact are often cut off, like grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and others within the family.  Later provisions of the legislation allow for relations to make applications for access, but there is a need to define what we mean by \"access\".  That is a modern definition which reflects the approach taken in a series of other countries.<\/p> <p>  We also do not have a definition of \"custody\".  Everyone thinks he or she knows what the concept of custody means.  One of the great areas of difficulty when relationships break down is, if one parent is awarded custody, the other parent thinks he or she has no further involvement or engagement with his or her children.  While the concepts of custody and guardianship have been used for some centuries, they are not adequately defined in Irish law.  There is a need to define the concept of custody and be clear on what we mean by it.  We reference it in the legislation; it is not defined.  The definition that was previously before this committee stated as follows: \"'custody', in relation to a child, includes the provision of day-to-day care of a child, to protect and supervise the child and the right to provide a residence for the child and may include providing such care for one or more specified days or parts of days\".  On some occasions, parents have joint custody.  They share the custody of a child and a child can live with one parent for a period of the week and the other parent for another period of the week.  We do not have a definition.  Unless I am missing something, it seems that the definition has been dropped out of the legislation.  Again, I do not understand why.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the final issue that I want to mention in this context, I cannot think of where else I can reference it other than in the conversation that we might have on section 41, so if the Chairman wants to pull me up when I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#EE00100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I do.

We took a different approach to the development of the legislation.  We decided that, instead of repealing the guardianship Act, we would amend it in this Bill in the way that has been outlined.  That different approach had implications for other sections of the Bill and some of these definitions.  My legal advice was that no new definition was required or advisable in our approach to the Bill.<\/p> <p>  This is a contentious area in the courts.  A number of broader points were made by Deputies in the course of the Second Stage debate.  In light of the new initiatives contained in the Bill, many Deputies made the point that how children and families were dealt with in the court system needed to be improved and court welfare services for parents needed to be developed.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on the definitions of \"access\" and \"custody\".  The decision to amend rather than repeal was taken.  This is a large Bill and has involved a significant amount of work.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Attorney General and all of her staff who have been working on it for months on end to address the range of issues it encompasses.

I am sorry to phrase it that way.  If the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 remained exactly as it was with no amendments, there would still be a need for us to finally have a definition of these concepts.  They are defined worldwide in legislation dealing with the custody, care and upbringing of children.  In my view, the entire Act should have been repealed.  On occasion I have had to wrestle with the approach of the Attorney General's office to particular pieces of legislation.  The drafting of the Bill would have been simpler if the Minister had not travelled the route she has taken, yet even travelling that route, there is no logic in the suggestion that these concepts should remain undefined.<\/p> <p>   The concept of access, as the courts have generally perceived it, has largely been applicable to the relationship between a child and parents.  This legislation does something very important in recognising the role that relations can play in a child's life.  There is a need for us to provide a modern definition of access, as opposed to allowing it to remain a concept that is referenced in court judgments in various formats and differing half-definitions.  Some judges have tried to define access as something that is the right of a child.  It makes no sense that in 2015 we are enacting a piece of legislation of this nature while the basic concepts of access and custody are not defined.<\/p> <p>  There also is a need to define them because there is enormous confusion on the part of parents as to what the concept of custody means.  I am going to talk about guardianship later on.  Once one parent concedes custody to the other in a court or mediation context, perhaps in circumstances in which it may not be practical for him or her to look after the child on a day-to-day basis, he or she is conceding a whole range of other things on which it is important to be consulted, such as the child's health, education, cultural engagement or religious upbringing.  The parent who obtains custody believes that, because he or she has custody, he or she can exclude the other parent from engagement on such issues.  In order to reduce the level of family embattlement that takes place when relationships break down, there is a great advantage in having a clear definition of custody, such that people understand it to mean that the child is physically being cared for by one parent, without meaning that that parent should not consult with the other parent, who has a good relationship with the child, on some of the fundamental decisions to be made about the child's life.<\/p> <p>  One of the difficulties have I found as a practising lawyer, particularly in the District Court, is that judges often do not themselves distinguish between guardianship and custody, and are confused about it.  To get over the sense some parents have that they are to be disengaged from their child's life entirely when the other parent is granted custody, there are occasions when judges make orders of joint custody that do not involve the child living part of the time with one parent and part of the time with the other.  They make an order of joint custody and detail that the child should primarily reside with one of the parents.  That is just a custody order.  Even the Judiciary can be confused as to what on earth custody means, particularly at the lower levels.  I have seen it on multiple occasions in 30 years of practice as a family lawyer.  It is extraordinary how this is a continuing and prevailing difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider this on Report Stage, because it makes no sense.  I do not know what advice could be legitimately given to suggest, even given the somewhat complex structure that has now been adopted, that it would do some damage to include the definitions I have suggested or some reasonable variant of them.  That is an issue on which the Attorney General's office should be further engaged.  I presume we are stuck with the structure that is here, but I would dearly love to know why we are preserving a piece of legislation that contains some provisions - I do not have the 1964 Act with me, but from memory I think they are in Part III - that have been redundant for decades.  Why are we not providing a modern legal framework in its entirety?  We should have one piece of legislation that people can go to - namely, the legislation dealing with guardianship, custody of and access to children - rather than having to stray through myriad different pieces of legislation, with sections of one Act amending another Act that amends another Act.  It is bad legislative practice and it is also unfair to assume that when we legislate this way, everyone who practises in the area, including the Judiciary, will necessarily find their way through the legislative maze that is created.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#FF00100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>When we are reporting back to the D&aacute;il, all of these issues can be taken into account.

The Deputy would be very familiar with the fact that on occasion, repeals of entire Acts have resulted in inadvertent deletion of provisions it was intended to retain.

I want to return to the issue of guardianship as well.  It is important that we have an extended description of the obligations - perhaps &quot;responsibilities&quot; is a better word - and rights of guardians.  I will not detain the committee by reciting what was in head 36 of the draft Bill that this committee considered last year.  That particular provision reflected global best practice in jurisdictions that have the most up-to-date legislation dealing with children.<\/p><p>It is particularly important in the context of relationships that have broken down to specify the rights and obligations of parents and to ensure the custodial parent involves the other parent in fundamental issues relating to children.  I made a point in the D&aacute;il about what happens in a small number of instances when relationships break down.  This does not apply to the majority of parents who behave responsibly when relationships break down by trying to protect their children from difficulties.  Most custodial parents try to maintain a good relationship with the non-custodial parent where it is in the best interests of the children to do so, but I am afraid that some parents do not behave in this manner.  Some parents go to war with each other.  Mothers create problems for fathers, or fathers create problems for mothers.  Some parents simply try to destroy the relationship between the child and the estranged parent.<\/p><p>The provision in the draft Bill to which I have referred was an important one.  It stated:<blockquote>In exercising or continuing to exercise the duties, powers, rights and responsibilities of a guardian in relation to a child, a guardian of the child shall act jointly (in particular by consulting wherever practicable with the aim of securing agreement) with any other guardian of the child.<\/blockquote>Such a provision has not been included in the Bill before the committee.  The draft version of the Bill further provided:<blockquote>Except where otherwise stated by way of court order, each guardian is entitled &ndash; (a) to be informed of and consulted about and to make all significant decisions affecting the child in the exercise of the powers, rights and responsibilities of guardianship derived in subhead (5), and <br \/><br \/>(b) to have sufficient contact with the child to exercise those powers, rights and responsibilities.<\/blockquote>Under the draft Bill, each guardian would have a responsibility to &quot;nurture the child&rsquo;s physical, psychological, emotional, intellectual, social and other personal development &quot; and to &quot;ensure the child is properly maintained and supported and is provided with necessary medical care, food, clothing, accommodation and access to appropriate education&quot;.<\/p><p>A range of matters were detailed in head 36 and the subheads that were published.  I emphasise that these measures were not reinventing the wheel.  They were based on best practice in other jurisdictions.  It was considered not only that they improved the law and provided clarity, but also that they helped to create an ethos in which the courts would encourage co-operation between estranged parents in the interests of children.  Those provisions represent a statutory roadmap, to some extent, in so far as they could very well be included in a very reasonable leaflet indicating to estranged parents that each of them has particular rights and responsibilities and that they need to co-operate in the best interests of their children by approaching matters as detailed.  I presume I will be told that these provisions are not being included in this legislation because they were not in the 1964 Act.  I am afraid that does not make any sense.  If we were simply trying to keep the 1964 Act in place, some of the other changes that we are happily implementing would not be part of the legislation.<\/p><p>I am raising this not simply in my capacity as a politician but as someone who practised in the area of family law for over 30 years.  I used to spend large parts of my time trying to persuade people who wanted to go to war with each other to deal with each other in a more civilised way in the best interests of their children.  There were occasions when it was extraordinarily difficult for them to gain that insight.  This legislation envisages that parents who are not co-operating might avail of parental counselling services or certain other support services.  In that context, it would be extremely useful for the obligations of parents, as well as their rights, to be set out in a straightforward, easily understandable linguistic framework that would be part and parcel of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#GG00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>It might be helpful to the discussion to point out that section 45 of this Bill, which inserts a new section 6C into the 1964 Act, is linked to the points that have just been made.  It gives the court the power to appoint a person other than the parent as a guardian.  It spells out in detail the rights and responsibilities of the guardian.  The proposed new section 6C(11) of the 1964 Act provides that those rights and responsibilities are to:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>(a) decide on the child&rsquo;s place of residence;<br \/><br \/>(b) make decisions regarding the child&rsquo;s religious, spiritual, cultural and linguistic upbringing;<br \/><br \/>(c) decide with whom the child is to live;<br \/><br \/>(d) consent to medical, dental and other health related treatment for the child, in respect of which a guardian's consent is required;<br \/><br \/>(e) consent under section 14 of the Passports Act 2008 to the issue of a passport to the child;<br \/><br \/>(f) place the child for adoption.<\/blockquote>These key rights are clearly spelled out in the legislation.  We have dealt with the point that guardians must act jointly.  That does not always mean consulting on all decisions, especially those which are urgent.  If we were to draft the legislation in a different way - a stronger way - it could cast into doubt the right of the guardian to make any decision unilaterally.  That was the legal advice I received about the way this could be dealt with in legislation.  Of course I realise, not least from my own practice as a social worker over many years, that these decisions are extremely difficult and complicated.  I am aware that a range of relationships and competing rights come into play.  I have always acknowledged Deputy Shatter's major contribution to this legislation.  I think it will give us further enhanced powers, not least because the definition of &quot;best interest&quot; is dealt with in much more detail than ever before in legislation.  That will be very helpful because it will ensure the courts have further legislation on which to rely in order to make the best decisions for children in these very difficult family relationship situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#GG00600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I would like to give a brief response.

It really does not make sense.  I would like to see the best possible legislation here.  I have no interest beyond ensuring we have the best possible legislation that protects the best interests of the child and provides absolute clarity for parents regarding their rights and responsibilities.  Most parents in happy families do not need to be told that.  It is of particular importance where parents are estranged.

The provisions here substantially reflect the provisions in the Australian family law Act.  <\/p> <p>  With the Australian family law Act, in Australia they discovered that all of this was right and well but there were groups of parents who were so entrenched that it simply did not work.  One can urge people to go to parental counselling or to participate in some sort of family counselling or parenting programme, or one might even force one parent to pay the other parent the cost of the bus fare for an abandoned access that does not take place.  It is important that we realise there is a small group of parents who set out to destroy the relationship children have with the other parent when a marriage or relationship has collapsed.  It does not have to be marriage, people may have been cohabiting together, but one or both parents can go to war with each other.<\/p><p>Sometimes it is simply one and sometimes it is both, and the children are in the middle of it.  When this happens, the judges are frequently out of their depth.  They find family cases difficult to deal with.  In practice, when parents conduct themselves in this way, judges will normally urge on multiple occasions a parent to abide by court orders.  I have seen judges threaten to transfer custody of a child from one parent to the other where the custodial parent is clearly misbehaving, but very often that is not an appropriate order to make because the parent who is anxious to have access to a child either does not have the accommodation where a child could live or they are at work and it is not practical that they have the day-to-day care of the child.  There can be a whole range of reasons that it does not work.<\/p><p> I have seen on occasion judges literally tearing their hair out to resolve problems.  When people are on civil legal aid through one of the Government law centres and where one parent, for example, can afford a lawyer and the other cannot, and the parent with the lawyer decides to go to war with the other parent, there is the risk that the law centre would just throw its hands up and the parent who is experiencing difficulties in spending time with his or her children find they cannot even get legal representation to make their case to a court.  On occasion, judges just lose their temper with everyone, and where one parent is misbehaving and the other is behaving properly, the judge just does not want to know and will not listen to either of them, to the detriment of the children and the parent whose contact with the children is being obstructed.<\/p><p> That long introduction is about saying there is no point in having all of this in the Bill if there is no sanction the courts can impose where one has a recalcitrant parent.  The only sanction the courts can impose at present is they can send parents to prison.  No one wants to see parents sent to prison.  Judges, understandably, are enormously reluctant to do that and in circumstances where it is the custodial parent who is misbehaving and the other parent does not have the capacity to care for a child for some of the reasons I gave, that is not even a practical option and it is not in the interests of the children that that occur.<\/p><p> Other jurisdictions have tried a variety of different ways of dealing with the situation.  One is that parents can be fined, so as opposed to simply paying someone back the cost of the bus fare or the cost of the petrol to drive out for an access visit that never takes place, the courts can impose a fine.  Often, where marriages or relationships have broken down there is limited finance so imposing a fine may not be a great option and indeed it may affect the children because there may be less money in the household, but it is one of the options that should be there because there are circumstances where people have gone to war where it is not a financial matter, they are just at war with each other, and the court should have sanctions as an option.  The court should have an option, for example, to require the recalcitrant parent to do community service.  It does not put them in prison or cost them money but takes up some of their spare time.  They could be doing the community a service while the other parent is having access.  There is a need for some form of sanction that falls short of imprisonment.  Some suggestions were put in the draft Bill for the consultative process on which I expected people would have different views, but it seems there is now no sanction if one does not comply, other than the one I mentioned - that one might be required to pay someone back the cost of their missed visit.<\/p><p> If a court takes a view that two parents together, or one who is creating a difficulty, should go to parental counselling and the court makes that order under this arrangement and the parent simply does not co-operate, the question is what is to happen next.  I am asking the Minister that question.  If the court orders that parents should go to family counselling together and one parent turns up and the other does not, the question is what is to happen next.  If they both turn up and one is just abusive of the other at the family counselling as opposed to trying to work through issues to the benefit of the children, what is to happen next?  An answer is required in that regard for this to work, and to improve the predicament that some estranged parents find themselves in, which is enormously to the detriment of children.<\/p><p> The other thing I have learned from 30 years of family law experience is that I can recall circumstances where I represented estranged spouses in the late 1970s and early 1980s who went to war with each other and where one spouse set out to destroy the relationship of the children with the other spouse.  I was long enough as a lawyer to subsequently represent the adult children of those people who themselves were in a dysfunctional relationship because they had been damaged as children by the way their own parents conducted themselves, and now they were damaged in their relationship and they were now behaving in exactly the same way because that is all they knew.  This is not just about particular couples; it is about a cycle of family dysfunction that needs to be broken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#HH04700","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond to that interesting point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#JJ00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Yes.  The provisions in 18A and 18D of section 56 are very carefully balanced to address the issue, which is that we want to enable children to have meaningful relationships with both parents.  The mechanisms we have here seek to change a parent&rsquo;s behaviour, obviously not to penalise the child.  It would be very traumatic for a child if a member of the Garda were to enter the house and remove the child by force to bring him or her to the other parent.  We clearly want to see a situation where the court has increased powers to ensure that the parents are not in contempt of court and that they do carry out what the court intended in relation to the access issues we are talking about.  The existing enforcement orders do provide for quite a number of approaches.  I will not go through them all but they are listed under section 56(4)(a), (b) and (c)(i)(ii)(iii) and 123, which I believe gives the court extra opportunities which do not exist at present to ensure that the terms of access are met by both parents.  That is the intention.  Of course there will be circumstances where a parent may simply be in contempt of court.  I was advised that community service is an alternative to prison and therefore a prison sentence would have to be specified in the first place before a person could be asked to do community service as an alternative.<\/p> <p>  The other influencer in terms of how we approached this section was the strong representations made to the committee by the Ombudsman for Children, who said that we should not adopt this approach to access.  She advised very strongly against removing those sanctions, as did other organisations such as One Family, and Women&rsquo;s Aid also made comments in relation to the sanctions.<\/p> <p>  This is a very difficult area in terms of trying to get parents to work well together in the best interests of the child.  Sometimes, clearly parents do not act in the best interests of the child.  The new mechanisms in the Bill will be helpful for courts.  The broader context where this can be dealt with even more effectively is in reform of the courts, developing court welfare services to a greater degree and having more contact centres.  All of those areas need development in this country as they are very under-developed at present.  We have had two very good pilot projects on contact centres where very good work was done by Barnardos and other groups to help parents.  In effect, they mediate with parents and make sure access visits go well.  The feedback I got from Barnardos is that a very significant amount of detailed work needed to be done with parents before they could get them to the point of fully fulfilling the access, but they felt the contact centres were a very worthwhile way to approach it.  We have a lot of work to do in this area to support parents to continue parenting even where there is high conflict, tension and emotion.  A lot of work can be done with those parents but it does require the development of services in this area.  There is much work to be done in this country in that regard.  We removed the sanctions to which Deputy Shatter referred that were in the original draft on the basis I have just outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#JJ00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I agree with everything the Minister has just said about the need to provide the back-up services and to provide a more sophisticated court welfare service, which is practically non-existent in the context of the family law area at the moment.<\/p> <p>   The whole point of this is to ensure that where people are in contempt of court, imprisonment is not the only remedy available to the court.  I am an enthusiast for what we have here, in subsection (4) that the Minister mentioned, the parent counselling, family counselling, all of these provisions, which indeed were in the original provision that the committee dealt with.  I have no theological or ideological commitment to the original Bill because my perception was that it could be improved and we wanted to go through a consultative process but I do know that unfortunately with the best will in the world there are a group of parents who will not cooperate with any of these arrangements and the courts are bereft of an alternative then to imprisonment.  We need to ensure that parents who behave badly and who could impact, not only on the best interests of their children as children, but on the capacity of their children as adults to have a normal functioning relationship, that the activities of those parents are curtailed, that there is some sanction the courts can utilise.  There is no particular reason, for example, a community service sanction in the context of family law needs to be tied in with anyone committing criminal offences.  It is just that community service is an alternative in the criminal law area to a sentence of imprisonment.  There is no particular reason there could not be a stand-alone provision where a judge dealing with a recalcitrant parent behaving contrary to the best interests of a child could not say, \"Well, if you do not go to parental counselling or family counselling and if you do not genuinely co-operate, I have other remedies at my disposal and one of the things you may have to do is go off for a couple of hours or three or four hours every week and do designated community service\".  That is not the worst of sanctions but it incentivises co-operation and it is not a sanction that renders a parent incapable of continuing to act as a custodial parent, if it is the custodial parent who is misbehaving.  I think we have to have an open mind on these things and all I am saying is, and I keep coming back to something I said this morning, we are not inventing the wheel.  We are travelling a route that other jurisdictions have travelled in this area some 20 to 25 years ago and have discovered that just doing this is not the solution.  This is really valuable and helpful but there must be some alternative sanction if it is not working.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#KK00100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>As a non-member of the committee there are one or two things that I would like to raise, possibly with a view to---<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#KK00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The Deputy must confine herself to this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#KK00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Yes, I will.  There were many contributions in the last Stage in the House about fathers' rights and the alleged denial of access by women to fathers in custody.  There were many contributions by different Deputies about that.  I think in this section it clarifies that a second parent can apply to the courts for enforcement and for custody.  There seems to be a lot of confusion between guardianship and custody among Deputies and among members of the public.  It seems to me that this is what is being used to justify the introduction of automatic guardianship, which I would have questions about, because guardianship gives somebody sweeping powers, for example in relation to passports and the residence of the child.<\/p> <p>  In cases where relations have broken down, and contact with the child may have broken down over years despite, let us say, the father in this case, living for a full year or more with the mother, I am a bit concerned about the safeguards in relation to violence against women, people who are escaping violent relationships, and giving automatic guardianship to men, in this particular case.  One in five women experiences domestic violence.  That is quite a lot of women.  We have the highest rate of single-parent families in this country.  I know there are situations where men have been deprived of seeing their children but, it is very clear here, they can apply for custody and unless there is a very good reason, they will get access to their children.  What I am more concerned about is guardianship being given automatically to people who may have had no connection over a long period of time, financial support, emotional support or anything else.

For the first time we have gone into detail, as I have already said to the committee, about what constitutes best interest.  The point I want to make in response to the Deputy is that we have linked with quite a wide range of organisations that work directly with families where there is violence.  We have included in the best interest description, when the court is making a decision about a child in relation to access, custody, or guardianship, \"The court shall have regard to family violence that has occurred or is likely to occur in the family of the child including the impact or likely impact of such violence on the safety of the child and other members of his or her family, the child's personal well-being, including the child's psychological and emotional well-being, the victim of such violence, and the capacity of the perpetrator of the violence to properly care for the child and the risk, if any, that the perpetrator poses to the child.\"  That is an interesting point that is often spoken about.

I certainly do not think that criminal law should be introduced into the family law area.

On occasions fathers create enormous difficulties for custodial mothers by not complying with access arrangements or using them to try to turn the child against the mother.  I have seen every combination of this.  What I am saying is that what we have in the Bill allowing the courts to require people to attend parental counselling, allowing the courts to require people to attend family counselling, all of this is a great advance and very important but we need, when those individuals who the court directs to do this do no cooperate, the court needs some sanction and there is no reason why, for example, the court should not have the capacity to prescribe stand-alone community service.

How will this work in practice and is it adequate?  The amendment of sections 41 and 42 of the 1995 Act is not adequate and does not go far enough.  I direct my attention to a child born outside marriage because in a marital family there is no difficulty about lump sum orders in other provisions in our family law legislation.  My example involves an unmarried couple who reside together for a period, a child is born and the father makes off.  Let us assume the father is reasonably wealthy and owns a number of properties or substantial assets and he may well be able to afford a house for his child if the court orders a lump sum payment including an element for the accommodation of the child.

I would have mentioned I was involved in court proceedings some years ago.  This is a declaration of interest that I have referenced on several occasions.  The case involved an unmarried mother left high and dry by an extremely wealthy father with whom she had been residing.  The Circuit Court made an order for &euro;400,000 for the purchase of a house for the benefit of the child and the mother.  The High Court reversed that order on the basis that lump sum orders under this particular provision could be made to benefit the children of married couples but not a child born outside marriage.  This made no sense in the context of how the law was framed.  The case was taken to the European Court of Justice and was settled on the basis that the law would be adequately changed to ensure no judge would do this in the future.<\/p> <p>  This provision goes part of the way.  The real difficulty is that it does not spell out in full what the Minister intends.  I agree with her that this is the intention.  There is a risk, however, in the manner in which the Judiciary approaches this.  The antiquated approach taken in the above case by a learned member of the High Court which was clearly going to get this State into difficulty in the European courts could be replicated.  There is a need to expressly make it clear that in making provision for accommodation, it can include, where it is financially appropriate, a sum be provided for the purchase of a home for the benefit of the child and the parent - most frequently it will be the mother - bringing up the child.  That is not clear from this, however.  This measure could be interpreted by a court as requiring someone to provide a couple of thousand euro by way of a lump sum as a down payment for a rental property.  It may well be that this is what it can only be where people have very limited means.  However, that was not the intention.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect is that if the courts are to make a lump sum order to allow for the purchase of accommodation to give a child security, the courts have to have powers to determine the ownership of that property.  If a lump sum is to be provided for accommodation, is the property, for example, to be purchased in the mother&rsquo;s name to be held in trust for the child?  Is it to be purchased in the father&rsquo;s name on the basis the child will only live in the property until a particular age and then will vacate it?  Can the lump sum be used to put the property into the joint names of mother and child where perhaps the mother will be the primary custodial parent, the best part of 18 years?  It would be a gross injustice that when her child finally reaches adulthood and ends education that she and the child could be rendered homeless.  This is not adequately teased out yet.<\/p> <p>  The original provision that the committee considered had another section that allowed for the courts to order that property be purchased in the name of trustees.  More work was needed to be done on that particular provision, however.  That was fine by way of heads of a Bill but it needed to be teased out further.  It now seems to me that instead it has not dealt with the ownership of a property that might be purchased to provide a roof over a child&rsquo;s head, provide security in that property, to provide the parent caring for the child, who in 98% of such cases in these circumstances will be the mother, will not be rendered homeless after she has brought the child up.  These issues need to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  There are interesting provisions in English legislation that could be possibly adapted into Irish legislation.  They would have to be adapted, however, because the manner in which English courts have interpreted their particular measure is not adequate to meet our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  This has been dealt with in other jurisdictions.  The reason is simple.  If a marriage breaks up and a divorce decree is sought, the courts can make lump sum orders and require that a home be purchased with funds where there are family assets for the benefit of the mother and child.  When a couple breaks up or a child is born outside of marriage to a very wealthy father, then that child should have the same equal entitlement to a roof over his or her head as any other child has.<\/p> <p>  What was in the original draft Bill was not by any means perfect.  It was adequate for a consultative process.  There is a need to tease this out further.  This is too brief and knowing the manner in which the Judiciary will come to approach this, we will all be back again some years from now.  What is more important - people being back here or the State being in the European Court?  This will be to the disadvantage of a number of children in coming years for whom better provision could be made if we deal with this correctly now.  A more sophisticated provision addressing these issues should be introduced on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015030500002#MM00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1425547800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Another section relevant to this Part is that we have separately amended section 11(2) of the 1964 Act to ensure a parent is liable for maintenance, whether or not the parent is the guardian of the child.
