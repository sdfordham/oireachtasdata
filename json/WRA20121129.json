As I noted when I addressed the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI) Annual Conference earlier this year, &ldquo;Local radio gives a voice and enhances social dialogue for people of all ages ... it provides a forum for local communities; it enhances a local community; it gives confidence to people and indeed is an expression of the community in which the station is broadcast&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that these stations were founded as commercial operations, with the profit motive as their primary objective.<\/p><p>  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear terms; terms which included a limited amount of &lsquo;public service&rsquo; type content.  Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The licences were accepted in the knowledge that public funding was not available for small broadcasters.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial enterprises.<\/p><p>  Moreover, it should also be noted that their very popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.<\/p><p>  Also, I would like to clarify for the Deputy that, even if I were minded to provide public monies to private investors as the Deputy seems to be suggesting EU State Aid rules very definitely apply in this case.<\/p><p>  It is categorically not possible for the State to simply decide to fund a set of incumbent licence holders during a licence period.

For wind it is assumed that they are replacing marginal gas generation.  This results in a more conservative estimate of avoided primary energy and emissions than taking say the average system generation as used in the International Energy Agency&#8217;s Partial Substitution Methodology.  The estimated avoided primary energy is then used to arrive at an estimated avoided gas import cost figure using the price of natural gas for electricity generation (IEA Energy Prices &amp; Taxes).<\/p><p><br \/>  The above figures relate only to avoided energy import costs.

Therefore operational matters are a matter for the Board and management of An Post.  These are areas in which I have no statutory function.<\/p><p>  Nonetheless, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable State company, providing high quality services on a nationwide basis through a network of economically viable post offices.<\/p><p>  I firmly believe An Post has many strengths.  It is a trusted brand and it also has the largest retail presence in the Country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.<\/p><p>  However, the reality is that the core mail business has suffered a major fall and this has impacted seriously on the Company&rsquo;s revenue flow.  In response, the Company is proactively seeking to keep costs down and diversify its business.  Control of costs must, in particular, be rigorously pursued by the Company in light of the continuing drain on revenue arising from the core mails business.  It is incumbent that it remains in a financially sustainable position.<\/p><p>  As regards diversification, An Post announced that following the decision of AIB to close a number of branches, an extended range of AIB services will be available through Post Offices in the locality of the closures.  This is beneficial not only to An Post as a commercial body but also to the local communities.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, in May this year I welcomed the arrangement between An Post One Direct and Aviva which saw 23 Aviva insurance branches become One Direct Outlets.  This not only secured some of the jobs that were at risk due to Aviva's restructuring but it broadened An Post's portfolio of financial services offering to customers.<\/p><p>  In the context of the public sector reform and service delivery agenda, I continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and other Ministers in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies.

ComReg&#8217;s Information Notice, available on the ComReg website , sets out the population coverage obligations that apply to these licences.  In this regard it requires that all licence holders must attain and maintain a minimum coverage of 70% of the population within 3 years.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  This plan follows on from the publication of the report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce and a period of public consultation.  Full details of these reports can be found on my Department&#8217;s website at the following link: <\/p><p><br \/>  The National Broadband Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &#8211; specifically: <\/p><p>-  70Mbps &#8211; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>-  At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and <\/p><p>-  A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is intended that the private sector will be the key driver of investment with potential State intervention only where the market is unlikely to invest. <\/p><p><br \/>  The plan contains actions for: investment, demand stimulation, infrastructure barrier removal, spectrum policy, potential contribution of State entities, and policy and regulation.  This approach seeks to achieve a step-change in the level of services available throughout the country, by accelerating private sector investment through a range of actions by public stakeholders, and particularly with regard to rural areas where the State expects to co-invest with the private sector in areas where the commercial case for infrastructure investment does not exist. <\/p><p><br \/>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p><br \/>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take at least a number of months to complete and will identify the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention to ensure that the Government&#8217;s commitment that a minimum of 30Mbps be available throughout the country, is realised.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":65,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 23.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Schemes","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[53249\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason the ESB is planning to lay a fibre optic cable between Ireland and Wales; his view on whether such a project is necessary or appropriate for the ESB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>This is an operational matter for the ESB, which is a commercial State company and I have no role or function in this regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":69,"content":"<p>Question No. 32 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[53272\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the implications for Irish Water of any sale or part sale of Bord G&aacute;is; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>The Government has decided to dispose of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Energy business as part of the State Assets disposal programme.

The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  The second Action Plan was approved by Government recently and will be published shortly.  The Plan provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy efficiency objectives and shows that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy savings target by 2020.  It will also set out a range of energy saving actions in the public sector, which will be prioritised between now and 2020.<\/p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving the 33% savings target for the public sector would save at least &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  In order to underpin delivery of the national energy savings target, my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is working together to establish a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  I recently wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to the SEAI.  Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.<\/p><p>  This year the SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to the SEAI.  From this data, detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow the SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.<\/p><p>  Since 2009, my Department through the SEAI has supported over 140 public sector retrofit projects.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces 2012 Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) type models.  I recently approved the formation of an action group and work is underway to develop and deliver in 2013, a national framework for energy performance contracting, which will stimulate mass scale retrofitting projects across the public sector.  This has been complemented by the Government decision to require all public sector bodies to go out to the market for energy services if their energy spend is more than &euro;500,000 per year.  The energy performance contracting framework will allow public bodies to implement projects whilst, most importantly, not relying on additional public expenditure to do so, thus not impacting on their capital budgets whilst also reducing their operating costs.<\/p><p>  The recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however, the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  My Department will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.<\/p><p>As outlined above, considerable progress with accompanying savings is being made in energy efficiency in the public sector.  The Deputy can be assured of my strong commitment to realising the goals we have set for energy efficiency in the public sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":86,"content":"<p>Question No. 38 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":87,"content":"<p>Question No. 39 answered with Question No. 25.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC02050"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[53326\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900045#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will agree that with regard to the 4G spectrum licences which run until 2030, much shorter licence periods would better suit Ireland's best interests.","asker":"1015","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p><b><\/b>  The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended.<\/p><p>Regulation 9(6) of the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Authorisation) Regulations 2011 requires that rights of use of radio frequencies be in force for such period as ComReg considers appropriate having, inter alia,<i><\/i>  taken due account of the need to allow for an appropriate period for investment amortisation.

Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and accordingly the CER no longer sanctions or approves electricity prices in the market.  Business and domestic customers can as a result of deregulation avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.<\/p><p>  The Public Obligation Service (PSO) levy has been in place since 2001 and is the support mechanism for peat generation and the development of renewable electricity.  The PSO also supports the output of two gas fuelled power plants built in 2005 to secure much needed generation capacity at the time.  The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by the three peat stations and renewable energy sources.  The levy has supported the connection of more than 1,400 MW of renewable energy, mostly wind, to the electricity grid over the last decade.<\/p><p>  The CER determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers.  Its legal basis and method of calculation are set out in the regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The CER publishes its decision on the total amount of the PSO as a result of these calculations annually for the purposes of determining the amount of the PSO to be charged for the forthcoming year starting 1st October.  In August 2012 the CER published its decision paper on the PSO levy for 2012\/2013, which came into effect on 1st October 2012.  A total PSO levy of &euro;131.2m has been calculated for 2012\/13, of which &euro;47.4 million of the cost is attributable to renewables (i.e. just over one third of the PSO).  The PSO levy amount per customer is estimated by the CER for the coming year to be &euro;27.82 per domestic customer (&euro;2.32 per month), of which approximately &euro;9 per annum would be attributable to renewable energy on this basis.  This is among the lowest costs to consumers for the support of renewables in any EU Member State.<\/p><p>  It is the case that the development of renewable energy in Ireland is lowering our exposure to the volatile fossil fuel imports market in the long run and that the existing feed-in tariff reflected in the PSO levy is essential to support this development.<\/p><p>  Under Directive 2009\/28\/EC Ireland is required to achieve a legally binding renewable energy target by 2020 and as part of the Directive, each Member State was required to produce a National Renewable Energy Action Plan for submission to the European Commission setting out how the target would be achieved.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s target is 16% overall, with a minimum of 10% in the transport sector.  The target has to be met across heat, electricity and transport, which each represent approximately one third of our energy consumption.<\/p><p>  At end 2011, 6.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy consumption was from renewable resources and a further 9.5% is required in the next 8 years if Ireland is to meet its target.  This will require a significant expansion in renewables.  In terms of the electricity sector, Ireland&rsquo;s intention is to meet a large proportion of the national target (40%) through onshore wind, which is cost effective to the electricity consumer.  A decision was taken earlier in 2012 to pursue onshore wind over offshore wind in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s national target in the first instance on cost grounds and in this regard a new feed in tariff scheme was introduced for onshore wind, while it was decided not to introduce a tariff for offshore wind.<\/p><p>  A number of studies have to date been undertaken to examine the effect of renewables on electricity prices by various bodies including the ESRI, the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA) and jointly by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland SEAI) and EirGrid.  The ESRI and IWEA studies both looked at 2020, while the SEAI and EirGrid study looked at 2011.  The SEAI and EirGrid study found that because wind reduces the cost of wholesale electricity when wind is available on the system, the effect of the PSO was cancelled out and the cost was effectively zero.

On a pro-forma statutory basis, the Bank&rsquo;s net loan book decreased by &euro;12.1bn or 43% between 31 December 2010 and 30 June 2012.<\/p><p>  Included in these figures are loans sold by the Bank of &euro;5.3bn, which were primarily bulk US loan sales, related to the closure of the Bank&rsquo;s US offices in 2011.  Gross loans of &euro;6.7bn were sold with related provisions of &euro;1.4bn and derivatives and other assets of &euro;0.2bn.  Proceeds received were &euro;5.1bn, resulting in a net loss on disposal of &euro;0.4bn.

The purpose of transition management is to enable the market risks, operational risks and costs incurred to be managed systematically. <\/p><p>  The C&amp;AG Report states that the NTMA outlined the context for the overcharging and that it engages large regulated organisations of scale and substance as transition managers and implements robust contractual arrangements. The NTMA noted that the pricing amendments improperly applied by State Street Bank Europe Ltd were never visible to the NTMA and that the NPRF had been reimbursed for the overcharged amounts. The NTMA stated that it had identified three actions, which were set out in the C&amp;AG Report, which it will implement to mitigate risks specifically associated with activities similar in nature to those encountered on transition number 14. The C&amp;AG made four recommendations which the NTMA will implement to the greatest extent possible, as reflected in the Chief Executive&rsquo;s responses as set out in the C&amp;AG Report.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that there is no requirement for any additional measures to be taken. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900047#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rates","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900047#WRE02250"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[53489\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900047#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider putting in place a system where play-schools can apply for tax back after they purchase equipment for their facilities as new equipment is essential to provide a quality and safe service for young children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>Bodies supplying educational services, such as play-schools, are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the current version of which came into effect from 1 January 2011, was issued under the provisions of section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.  The Code applies to the mortgage lending activities of all entities regulated by the Central Bank, except for credit unions, in respect of loans which are secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary residence.  The Code sets out the framework within which a regulated mortgage lender must engage with a borrower who is in arrears, or pre-arrears, in respect of a loan secured on the borrower&#8217;s primary residence and who is co-operating with the lender.<\/p><p><br \/>  This revised Code sets out new and more detailed requirements that a lender must comply with when dealing with mortgage holders experiencing genuine arrears and financial difficulties.  In particular, it provides that each lender must establish a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and use this framework when dealing with its mortgage holders experiencing difficulty.  This framework provides for a number of steps such as:<\/p><p> - communication with borrowers;<\/p><p> - the use of a standard financial statement to obtain financial information;<\/p><p> - assessment of the customer&#8217;s circumstances by dedicated arrears support units;<\/p><p> - resolution, which require the lender to explore all options for an alternative repayment arrangement in order to determine the most viable option in each case, and<\/p><p> - an appeals process, which initially will be an internal Appeals Board within the institution, to reconsider the matter if the borrower is not satisfied with the proposed resolution response.  There is then the further option if necessary, to appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman after the internal appeal process has ended.<\/p><p><br \/>  MARP, therefore, is not a scheme as such but rather is a process put in place to govern the interaction between mortgage borrower and lender in circumstances where the former is experiencing genuine difficulty and allows both parties to assess the current situation with a view to coming to an optimal solution.  In particular, a lender is required to explore all options for an alternative repayment arrangement to determine which options are viable for each particular case.<\/p><p><br \/>  Other protections offered to borrowers under the CCMA include the following:<\/p><p> - all cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender;<\/p><p> - a lender must not apply to the courts to commence legal action for repossession until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower;<\/p><p> - where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least 12 months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the courts to commence legal action;<\/p><p> - each branch or office of the lender must have one person responsible for dealing with borrowers in difficulty and must also have a dedicated Arrears Support Unit to deal with all MARP cases;<\/p><p> - lenders are restricted from imposing charges on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears where the borrower is co-operating with the lender;<\/p><p> - all communications about arrears and pre-arrears must be provided in a timely, clear and consumer friendly manner, e.g. information booklet providing details of MARP and dedicated section on website. <\/p><p><br \/>  Quarter 2 2012 Mortgage Arrears Stats published in August shows the number of mortgages secured on Private Dwelling Homes (PDH&#8217;s) which are in arrears. This is also broken down into restructured number and type.  <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>.  The publication of Quarter 3 data is expected in mid-December, will also include information on Buy to Let properties for the first time.<\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman, I am informed by that Office that it introduced a policy last April in response to a number of complaints being submitted to his Office regarding mortgage arrears\/pre arrears, to deal with such cases. This policy states that a complainant must first engage with the financial institution in question and fully exhaust the MARP process. The Financial Services Ombudsman will not investigate such complaints where the MARP process has not been exhausted. This gives both parties the opportunity to re-engage with the process and find, where possible, an alternative resolution.  If a complainant uses the MARP process, with either party failing to come to a resolution, the complainant can revert back to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  In that regard, the above procedure has proved relatively successful as it ensures that the respective parties engage with one another, before referral to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. However, there have been cases where MARP has been exhausted, and the Ombudsman followed up by investigating such complaints.  Thus far, there have been 6 not upheld, with 5 partly upheld. There have been no cases where the Ombudsman fully upheld such a complaint.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank also informed me that a review of lenders compliance with the CCMA was carried out by it in 2011, focussing on charges imposed by lenders. Please see a link to the Press Release on the outcome of this review below.  <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Also attached, for information, is a link to the CCMA and the Central Bank&#8217;s Consumer Guide to dealing with your lender below.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i><\/p><p><i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank has informed me that it will commence a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in the first quarter of 2013.   The Central Bank would normally conduct a review following a reasonable time after implementation and the Code will require updating due to the introduction of the Personal Insolvency Arrangement insolvency framework as provided for in the Personal Insolvency Bill which is currently before the Oireachtas as well as longer term mortgage resolution options.  The review will take into consideration recent developments that may be relevant to the issue of mortgage arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900049#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900050#WRH00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900050#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[53410\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900050#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the date on which publishing companies may publish the Junior and Leaving Certificate mathematics papers; when will they be given the appropriate guidelines by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  This plan follows on from the publication of the report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce and a period of public consultation.  Full details of these reports can be found on my Department&#8217;s website at the following link: <\/p><p><br \/>  The National Broadband Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &#8211; specifically:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps &#8211; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; <\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and<\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is intended that the private sector will be the key driver of investment with potential State intervention only where the market is unlikely to invest. <\/p><p><br \/>  The plan contains actions for: investment, demand stimulation, infrastructure barrier removal, spectrum policy, potential contribution of State entities, and policy and regulation.<\/p><p><br \/>  This approach seeks to achieve a step-change in the level of services available throughout the country, by accelerating private sector investment through a range of actions by public stakeholders, and particularly with regard to rural areas where the State expects to co-invest with the private sector in areas where the commercial case for infrastructure investment does not exist. <\/p><p><br \/>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  <\/p><p><br \/>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p><br \/>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take at least a number of months to complete and will identify the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention to ensure that the Government&#8217;s commitment to ensure that a minimum of 30Mbps is available throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900056#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900056#WRO00950"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[53590\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112900056#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress made towards the delivery of product from the Corrib Gas field; the estimated time within which this is likely to be possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>Completion of the Corrib gas field development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.

The Limerick Regeneration Agencies (Northside and Southside) were established in June 2007 for a five-year term to 14 June 2012 for the purposes of building confidence and trust within the communities in Limerick and to facilitate a coordinated public sector response to the regeneration process. On the completion of their five-year term, the functions, assets, undertakings and liabilities of the Agencies were formally transferred to Limerick City Council, pending the establishment of the new Limerick Unitary Authority, with a new dedicated Office of Regeneration taking responsibility for managing and implementing the regeneration programme. <\/p><p>   The Office of Regeneration, with a dedicated staff of 23 administrative, technical and professional personnel, is headed by a Director of Regeneration, reporting directly to the Unitary Authority Manager. The Office currently has four staff at Senior Executive Officer\/Project Manager level to administer the social and economic regeneration programmes and the delivery of the physical implementation plans for the relevant areas. Two senior staff members are located at Moyross and Southill respectively. A complement of staff, including technical and professional staff with appropriate skills in the areas of planning, design and engineering services, are deployed at the Office of Regeneration to support the delivery of regeneration in the city.   <\/p><p>  The Director is charged with overseeing the transfer of functions from the Agencies to Limerick City Council and progressing the compilation and implementation of strategies and programmes for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the four areas concerned. This new Office, with key decision makers working in a single, unified team, will accelerate the delivery of projects as the regeneration process transitions from the planning to the implementation phase. Regeneration is retained as a separate entity with its own dedicated staff and annual capital budgets which gives a new impetus to regeneration and builds on the foundations laid so far by the Agencies. <\/p><p>  Over the past five years, a robust framework has been put in place to facilitate consultation with stakeholder groups on wide-ranging issues relating to the development and implementation of social and physical regeneration strategies.

We are disappointed that it was not possible to reach a deal on the MFF at last week&rsquo;s European Council meeting, but we will continue to strongly support the CAP budget lines in the renewed negotiations.  As regards the overall level of CAP funding, the Commission&rsquo;s original proposal to maintain spending at 2013 levels in nominal terms was regarded by Ireland as a reasonable starting point in the negotiations.  At last week's European Council meeting, the Taoiseach again strongly defended CAP funding, as did some other Heads of Government.  Ireland will continue to work with others to get the best possible deal for the CAP in the MFF.

The VEC&#8217;s and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) were the services to which people were most frequently referred.  FRCs have a broad range of involvement with children and young people and work closely with many local schools.  The range of interventions include early childhood care and education, initiatives to retain children and young people in school, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, youth caf&eacute;s, community based youth work, facilities and services for young people, work with particular target groups of vulnerable young people and work on issues of particular concern\/risk to young people e.g. alcohol and drugs prevention, etc.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Agency also provides funding to voluntary and community organisations providing marriage, relationship, child and bereavement counselling services.

Through direct provision or through its funding of a variety of family support and related community\/voluntary providers the HSE works to support families.  The HSE also receives children into care on a voluntary basis where parents indicate they need this support on a temporary or short-term basis because of their inability to cope.  At all times the HSE seeks to support families in accessing all of the services and benefits to which they are entitled to meet the needs of their children.

Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for fetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.
