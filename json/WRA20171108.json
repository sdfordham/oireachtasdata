I am confident that as our economy continues to grow the nursery sector will likewise prosper.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s horticulture sector contributed over &euro;430m to the value of output at farm-gate level. The horticulture sector is estimated to be directly responsible for over 6,600 jobs with many more employed indirectly both upstream and downstream.  Within the total horticulture farm gate output value of &euro;430m the hardy nursery stock sector and the protected amenity plant sector combined to contribute almost &euro;51m in 2016 to the value of output at farm-gate level.  This value was up from an estimated &euro;44m in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  While market prospects for amenity plant growers are certainly very positive,\u00a0I am very conscious of the challenges, not least from the recent storms,\u00a0currently facing the industry and my Department, along with the various state agencies; Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely to support the industry through a number of measures. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector is the main support offered by my Department to the amenity or nursery sector.  This scheme facilitates capital investments in a broad range of specialised horticultural equipment and buildings by providing grant aid on approved costs at a rate of 40%. In the case of young applicants under 35 years of age the rate of grant aid increases to 50%. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme is highly regarded by the industry and is an excellent vehicle for investment in all sectors of the Horticulture industry.  I sought an increase in the Budget allocation for the scheme in 2017 and this increase has been maintained through the allocation\u00a0of &euro;5m for the Scheme in 2018.  In light of the sectoral demand, I am working to advance the launch of the 2018 Commercial Horticulture Scheme . A\u00a0timely launch of the 2018 Scheme is recognition of the most recent challenge to the sector but is also a clear signal of my continued support for, and commitment to its ongoing development.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, &euro;6.4 million in grant aid has been paid to applicants from the Nursery Stock and related Amenity Plant Sectors over the period 2008-2016.  This has supported investment of almost &euro;16 million by the sector.  In the current year a further &euro;1.1 million in grant aid has been allocated under the scheme to 29 applicants from the Nursery Stock and related Amenity Plant Sectors. <\/p>  <p>  This year, approvals under the scheme were issued to an overall total of 156 applicants across the horticulture industry.  Many of the 2017 scheme applicants have already been inspected and paid.  The processing of more recent claims is on-going and every effort is being made to deliver payments as quickly as possible to assist growers that may be facing cash flow issues.  For 2017 the Commercial Horticulture Grants Scheme was allocated a budget of &euro;5m and my staff advise me that they expect the full budget available for the scheme this year will be utilised. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining the increased allocation of &euro;5m in funding for the 2018 Scheme of Investment Aid for Commercial Horticulture reflects this Government's commitment to ongoing support for Ireland&rsquo;s horticulture sector.  The competitive nature of the Commercial Horticulture Grants Scheme combined with the scheme&rsquo;s flexibility and ability to react to evolving situations are two key strengths in supporting this highly dynamic sector.<\/p>  <p>  Growers, including amenity plant nurseries that wish to apply for the scheme are encouraged to prepare and submit their applications as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of other supports for the sector I would also like to add that the &ldquo;SBCI Loan Scheme&rdquo; launched in last year&rsquo;s budget was a great success and a number of horticultural businesses have benefitted from these low interest loans.  As part of the recent Budget, &euro;25 million has been secured to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan scheme for\u00a0farmers, fishermen, and food businesses\u00a0in 2018 and further details about that scheme will be announced in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800078#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nitrates Usage","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800078#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[47097\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800078#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding attempts by the Government at EU level to ensure the reauthorising of glyphosate for Irish farmers.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>The European Commission extended the approval of glyphosate for a limited interim period in June 2016 to allow for the completion of an assessment by the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).

I convened the first formal meeting of the Committee on 7 July 2016 and I have held three subsequent meetings. <\/p>  <p>  This process was complemented by the All-Island Civic Dialogue process organised by the then Taoiseach. Under that process I hosted\u00a0six sector-specific gatherings covering fourteen different sectors, including fisheries. These engagements afforded me and my Department the opportunity to hear, at first hand, the difficulties and concerns of the sectors; and given that the process was an all island one, I had an opportunity to engage with stakeholders from Northern Ireland also.<\/p>  <p>  I have also engaged with my counterparts in many other Member States in an effort to raise their awareness of\u00a0the potential impact of an unfavourable Brexit agreement - or no agreement -\u00a0not only on Ireland but on the EU agrifood sector generally. In this regard there is regular engagement with the Commission, the UK, including Northern Ireland, and other member states both at political and official level.\u00a0 I have had specific bilateral meetings with my counterparts in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia, Poland, France, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium and\u00a0Spain to seek to establish common ground on the Brexit issue. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have had political engagement with the former NI Minister for Agriculture Michelle McIlveen, the former UK Secretary of State for DEFRA Andrea Leadsom and the UK Minister of State for Agriculture George Eustice. I have spoken by telephone with\u00a0DEFRA&rsquo;s current Secretary of State, Michael Gove, and am meeting him in Dublin shortly. In all of these engagements I have emphasised, and will continue to emphasise, the potential impact a hard Brexit will have on the historical trading relationships between the two jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on those businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium to long term threats\u00a0include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK,\u00a0potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. <\/p>  <p>  I and my Department, in cooperation with Government and other Departments and Agencies, are attempting to mitigate the consequences through a range of activities under two distinctive pillars &ndash; Competitiveness and Product\/Market Diversification.<\/p>  <p>  Under Competitiveness my Department introduced a number of measures in Budget 2017 to help minimise farm gate and business costs, including the introduction of\u00a0&euro;150m low cost loan scheme for primary producers,\u00a0new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes.\u00a0 Under Budget 2018\u00a0I have provided exchequer funding to support a\u00a0&euro;300m Brexit loan scheme, at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses, and my Department is working with SBCI to develop a similar scheme for primary producers and small businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Under Product\/Market Diversification I continue to support Bord Bia in its investment in market prioritisation initiatives, which are aimed at identifying potential diversification opportunities.\u00a0 Since the final quarter of 2016 I have provided Bord Bia with more than &euro;14 million in additional funding for a programme of marketing and promotional activity in international and EU markets, and also in the UK.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I have also allocated\u00a0an additional &euro;2m to Teagasc\u00a0to allow them to commence work on an &euro;8.8m investment in a\u00a0new National Food Innovation Hub which will help Irish food businesses to innovate and expand.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that I and the Government\u00a0remain very focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead.

Therefore it is to be expected that consideration of larger and more complex appeals may take more time than others which can, or will move towards settlement, more quickly.  That being the case, I am advised that  it is unlikely that the current appeals will take 17 years to settle.  I am also advised, by the TAC, that now its new case management system is almost fully functional, the Commission is getting to a position where it can run more case management conferences and more leader\/follower appeals, whereby in the first instance, some appeals may be settled more quickly because of earlier interaction with the TAC; and in the second instance, more appeals may settle by virtue of the outcome in a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; case, which has bearing on all the &ldquo;follower&rdquo; appeals.

Indeed, it has always been the case that a large number of appeals are settled by agreement between the parties rather than by being determined by the Appeal Commissioners. Such settlement discussions routinely involve a professional adviser retained by the taxpayer in question. This type of settlement, however, is more likely where the dispute involves the amount of a tax liability or there is a difference of opinion in relation to the facts of a case. There are many cases where there is no potential for informal settlement, in particular with appeals that involve the determination of a point of law. <\/p>  <p>  The Appeal Commissioners were specifically recruited because of their expertise and ability to adjudicate and determine disputes involving complex tax matters.

The key objective of the actions in the Plan was to &ldquo;manage the Public Service property portfolio in a professional, co-ordinated and efficient manner that maximises value for money and facilitates business needs and service provision&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW), with its Chairman as the Delivery Plan&rsquo;s <i>Senior Responsible Officer<\/i>, led the development of the Plan.  A Steering Group comprising public property stakeholders was established to oversee progress on the delivery of the actions by across the participating State bodies.<\/p><p>Significant progress was made in the implementation of the Delivery Plan actions, as reported in the <i>Final Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 (July 2017)<\/i>.  The utility and further development of certain outputs, under many of the actions, is continuing after the designated Reform Plan timeframe.<\/p><p>One of those outputs that will require continued maintenance and development is the Intra-State Property Register.  The Register currently has basic details on over 24,000 owned or leased properties by 94 individual organisations, including Central Government, Local Government, the HSE and Non-Commercial State organisations.  These properties, in the main, are office and other buildings used by State organisations in the exercise of their functions.  There are gaps in the data relating to individual properties.  The register is a work-in-progress and efforts are continuing to improve the accuracy of the data on the Register and to fill the gaps where data is missing.<\/p><p>The Intra-State Register is one of a number of inter-linked outputs under the Delivery Plan that provide a platform for a more integrated and strategic management of the State&rsquo;s Property portfolio.  The intention is that holders of State property assets should increasingly view property from a more strategic, State point of view rather than an individual or organisation viewpoint.  When an organisation has a property for disposal, the first method of disposal to be considered is the transfer of the surplus property to another State organisation.  The State Property Register facilitates this prioritised method of disposal by obliging State organisations with <b><i>surplus<\/i><\/b>property to identify it as such on the Register, and allow other State organisations a minimum of one month to express an interest. It is for this reason that the State Property Register records that a property is &lsquo;<b><i>surplus<\/i><\/b>to requirements&rsquo; <b><i>rather than &lsquo;vacant&rsquo;<\/i><\/b>.<\/p><p>I think that there is an important distinction between these two classifications, as &lsquo;surplus to requirements&rsquo; indicates that the decision has been made to dispose, which is unlikely to match the number of properties that are vacant but not surplus to requirements.  The Register does not record vacant properties.<\/p><p>It is important to note that while the OPW hosts the Register, the properties and the data are the responsibility of each of the 94 State organisations.  Each organisation is responsible for the efficient management of those properties.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars issued under the Delivery Plan outline the need for regular review of an organisation&rsquo;s property needs; and the use of appropriate appraisal processes for all decisions related to the acquisition, disposal and retention of property to ensure that the best use is made of State property assets to achieve value for money.<\/p><p>I understand that the Housing Delivery Office in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government did undertake an exercise to identify those State and semi-State lands that were deemed surplus to requirements in urban areas where housing pressures are most acute.  The exercise involved consultation with the various State and semi-State bodies including the OPW.  The results of this exercise are on the Rebuilding Ireland website.<\/p><p>My officials in the OPW regularly review our own property portfolio to identify any properties that might be surplus.  In the past year, a number of properties have transferred from the OPW to other State bodies to assist in alleviating homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800081#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800081#WRE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[47242\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800081#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the additional financial measures he will employ in 2018 to develop flood defences across the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>A total allocation of &euro;101 million approximately for overall flood risk management has been provided in the 2018 Vote of the Office of Public Works (OPW) representing an increase of 35% on the equivalent 2017 Estimates allocation.

The 2018 total allocation includes a provision of &euro;70m approximately for expenditure on flood defence works which is an increase of some &euro;25m over the 2017 allocation.  This significant increase is part of the commitment of &euro;430 million for flood risk management under the Government's six year Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 which will see the annual allocation for flood defence expenditure rise from &euro;45m currently to &euro;100million by 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 allocation will allow the OPW to continue with its existing programme of major flood relief schemes which currently has ten schemes at construction with another 26 at different stages of design or planning.

The impact of Brexit on Ireland will depend on the outcome of the complex negotiations still underway.  While this poses challenges in planning our response, it is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is in a strong position to deal with these challenges.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years we have seen economic growth becoming more firmly established, and our public finances have remained on a sustainable path.  As set out on Budget Day this year, 2018 will be the fourth successive year in which we will be able to increase expenditure on public services and infrastructure.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to protect and consolidate the progress that has been made to date.  Consequently, it is important to maintain a focus not just on the level of expenditure, but also on how public funds are being spent.  In this context the Spending Review process allows for the systematic examination of existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives.<\/p>  <p>  On Budget day in October I announced an additional allocation of capital expenditure of &euro;4.3 billion over the next four years, up to the end of our existing Capital Plan in 2021.  This additional allocation is central to our response to Brexit and will allow our State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects over the medium term, while also ensuring communities and businesses can plan ahead.  This additional funding has been allocated following the review of the Capital Plan, with this review providing an evidence base, reflecting sectoral gaps identified by robust analysis.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting the areas of our economy that may be significantly impacted by Brexit will be a key element of the Government&rsquo;s response.  To this end, as outlined in the Expenditure Report 2018, additional expenditure amounts have been specifically allocated to provide for Brexit related measures across a number of Departments including: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation; the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  Education, as well as delivering benefits for the individual and for society, is also vital to keeping our economy competitive and attracting investment in a post-Brexit world.  Continued investment in education remains a priority of this Government.  The allocation for Education in 2018 of over &euro;10 billion represents a new peak for the sector and over 16&frac12; per cent of total gross voted expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to expenditure measures, there are also a number of whole-of-Government arrangements already in place as part of our response to Brexit, such as the Cabinet Committee chaired by the Taoiseach.  We are also strengthening our relevant Departments, Agencies and overseas missions to ensure that they have the necessary capacity, capabilities and expertise to address the issues that may arise as a result of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800081#WRE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Court Recommendations","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800081#WRE03300"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[47244\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800081#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the progress on his Department&rsquo;s discussions with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding the implementation of Labour Court recommendation, LRC 19293, regarding the rights of community employment scheme supervisors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>In considering the particular matter referred to, regard must be had to the costs and precedent of such an arrangement were one to be created.

Redundancy arrangements for SNAs are set out in Department Circular 0058\/2006.<\/p><p>In addition, as per the provisions of the Supplementary Assignment Arrangements for SNAs which were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed and which continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement, where a school\/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours\/posts, then that additional allocation of hours\/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment.  These arrangements are set out in Department Circular 0042\/2017 (which can be accessed via the link ).<\/p><p>On 5<sup>th<\/sup>July 2017, I announced that 975 additional SNAs were to be allocated to schools over the period September to December 2017, a 7.5% increase in SNA numbers in order to meet the level of assessed demand.  This announcement brings the total number of SNAs to 13,990, representing an increase in the total numbers of SNAs of 32%, from 10,575 to 13,990 since 2011.<\/p><p>In addition, and as announced as part of Budget 2018, funding is being allocated for the recruitment of over 1,090 new SNAs in 2018 (based on current forecasts), including some 130 posts which will be filled in the period between January and June next year, with the remainder being appointed from September 2018.  This brings the total number of SNAs to over 15,000 (a 43% increase since 2011).<\/p><p>While reduced hours or redundancies will unavoidably occur in individual schools due to a variety of circumstances, these increases in SNA numbers coupled with the operation of the Supplementary Assignment Panel Arrangements make it more likely that SNAs can avoid redundancy and that part-time SNAs can gain or regain full-time employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Statutory Instruments","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[47201\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to outline his plans to postpone the implementation of SI No. 394 of 2017, Education Support Centres (Appointment and Secondment of Directors) Regulations 2017, (Appendix A), until such time as this matter has been discussed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in view of the concerns raised by the various education centres throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>I am aware of the concerns raised by a number of Education Support Centres referred to by\u00a0the Deputy.  Section 37 of the Education Act 1998 provides the statutory basis\u00a0for Education Support Centres and outlines the policy framework underpinning their recognition and functions, funding, staffing\u00a0and governance. The Act\u00a0empowers me as Minister to make regulations relating to the operation of centres including the appointment and remuneration of staff which includes the post of director.<\/p>  <p>  The regulations I recently promulgated under Section 37(6) of the Education Act underpins my Department's policy for the secondment of\u00a0teachers to\u00a0Education Support Centres. These regulations comply with relevant legal and policy requirements.  Accordingly, there are no plans to change the approach.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, my Department\u00a0arranges for the secondment of teachers from their teaching posts for the purpose of developing and providing CPD for teachers and for the appointment as Directors of Education Support Centres (ESC's). Secondments are a temporary arrangement renewable on a year to year basis. While on secondment, teachers retain their school post, the terms and conditions that apply to teachers and receive their salary and a secondment allowance which are met in full by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In 2010, a new policy of secondment was introduced which included a new limit on secondment numbers and established an upper limit of 5 years on the length of a secondment, following which the Directors return to their posts either as a teacher or an inspector.  The policy was agreed by the then Minister for Finance Mr Brian Lenihan T.D.<\/p>  <p>  There are many benefits from the revised policy for teachers, their boards of management and the system as a whole.\u00a0 Because an upper limit of 5 years now applies to secondments, there is:<\/p>  <p>- confidence that the teachers involved in the delivery of CPD have recent experience of the curriculum and of the school environment<\/p>  <p>- certainty about secondment parameters which assist individual teachers and their boards of management in planning.<\/p>  <p>  There are more opportunities for teachers to take on career enhancing roles in the support services and the Centres. Teachers returning to their school after a period of secondment have the potential to enrich their school environment and they become eligible to take on subsequent secondment opportunities after a period back in their school.<\/p>  <p>  Regular turnover of seconded teachers is now an established practice with teachers returning to enrich their schools so the investment in their skills is not lost.  Since 2010, 10 Education Centres have successfully recruited new Directors and the work of the Centres has not been negatively affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[47211\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when construction will commence on a school extension (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":246,"content":"<p>The school referred to by the Deputy was approved a\u00a0devolved grant under my Department's Additional Accommodation Scheme 2016\u00a0to\u00a0provide 1 mainstream classroom, 1 resource room and 1 assisted user toilet.<\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department recently\u00a0gave approval\u00a0to\u00a0the school authority for the project to proceed to Tender.<\/p><p>As this a\u00a0devolved project,\u00a0it is now a matter for the school\u00a0authority to progress the project\u00a0 through this stage of the architectural planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":247,"content":"<p>Question No. 126 answered with Question No. 118.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Scholarships","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF01200"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[47250\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800082#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a scholarship fund exists for Irish nationals accepted to study at a university (details supplied) for one year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>The principal financial support provided by\u00a0my Department for students in third level education\u00a0is the student grant scheme.

All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in Community Policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.<\/p><p>I am advised that Community policing continues to be a key aspect of the Garda approach to the prevention and detection of crime. Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of community based groups, as well in more formal settings such as Joint Policing Committees, to ensure that local issues can be aired and appropriate partnerships formed with communities to address matters of concern. Garda&iacute; also support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons. In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.

The Department supports the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR (2015) and the European Commission One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance (June 2017).<\/p>  <p>  A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years including improved surveillance of infections and prescribing, infection prevention and control processes, antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness raising and with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the emergence of virulent antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, in particular CPE or CRE, commonly known as 'superbugs', the HSE National Taskforce on HCAI AMR, established in late 2015, identified an urgent need to develop a comprehensive plan in response to the on-going and developing situation in relation to management of CPE within the healthcare system.  A national response team was established and a new National Clinical Lead for HCAI AMR was appointed to direct the work of the response team.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, on the considered advice of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) I activated the Public Health Emergency Plan on 25 October 2017 to further address CPE in our health system.  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on CPE, chaired by the CMO, has been convened and had its first meeting on 2 November last.   Membership of the team will include key stakeholders from the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE) management with responsibility for public health, surveillance, operations and quality assurance and patient representatives.  NPHET will meet on a weekly basis and continually evaluate the readiness of the health service to manage and sustain the containment of CPE as part of ordinary operations with a view to standing down the National Public Health Emergency Team at the appropriate time.  The National Public Health Emergency Team will direct and ensure an effective communications system at local, regional and national levels.  Regular updates including summary minutes of meetings will be via a dedicated web page, hosted on the Department of Health website.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 (iNAP) was launched on Wednesday, 25 October last.  The Plan, jointly launched by myself as Minister for Health and Minister Michael Creed TD, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been a cross-Departmental initiative, requiring a cross sectorial and whole of Government approach to addressing the world wide threat of AMR.<\/p>  <p>  iNAP was developed following the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR which required all countries to have in place a national action plan by mid-2017 and by the European Commission which also required Member States to develop a national action plan by mid-2017.  The Plan has been prepared by both Government Departments, with the guidance of the National  Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee.  This ambitious 3-year Plan has been developed in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and covers the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as human health - taking a 'One Health' approach to tackling AMR, encompassing all sectors.  The Plan lists Strategic Interventions and Activities, responsible bodies and priority rankings of timelines for implementation.  An implementation plan will be developed separately which will address means of tackling AMR as appropriate to each sector.  The National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) will discuss arrangements for progressing this body of work with the HSE's HCAI National Lead and relevant others; DAFM are establishing an AMR implementation plan team to oversee its body of work in addressing the interventions and activities listed proper to the agriculture and environment sectors.<\/p>  <p>  iNAP aims to ensure the development and implementation of multifaceted interventions which will safeguard against inappropriate prescribing, dispensing and consumption of medicines, while simultaneously promoting rational use in patients and animals that are expected to benefit from treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at national, European and International levels to this end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800083#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stroke Care","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800083#WRG02800"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[47212\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800083#WRG02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of stroke unit services available in Dundalk and Drogheda, County Louth, due to the higher volumes of stroke patients in these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1331","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800083#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800083#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[47236\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800083#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when transvaginal mesh (details supplied) was first used by the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>This matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.

No. 125 of 2016) establishes a point system, which will apply to the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0is detected.\u00a0 It is intended that the new Statutory instrument which I intend to sign shortly will replace S.I. No. 125 of 2016 to change the make-up of the Determination Panel set up under the 2016 S.I. to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement. \u00a0This will involve the appointment of three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General, thereby completely separating the enforcement and the determination functions.  The new SI will, to the extent possible, take on board the issues of concern in relation to procedures and processes highlighted in High Court judgments on this matter. \u00a0It will also address certain minor technical and drafting issues arising\u00a0in S.I. No. 125 of 2016 .<\/p>  <p>  In June 2016, I advised the Oireachtas that subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues, that I was hopeful of moving towards a system of sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, having consulted with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I made it clear that this move was subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues in order to ensure compliance with EU law.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There has been extensive examination and consideration of all the issues in relation to meeting our EU obligations to implement the points system in the interim period.\u00a0 The firm legal view available to me is that it is not possible to deliver on an effective and dissuasive points system, as required under EU law, by assigning points to licence holders upon successful prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to stakeholder consultation, I\u00a0discussed with industry representatives my plans to bring forward a new SI\u00a0at the Sea Fisheries Liaison Group meeting on 20 October 2017 and explained the amendments I am planning and the\u00a0justification for these amendments.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new S.I., the\u00a0licence holder may appeal on a point of law a decision of the independent\u00a0fisheries Adjudicator to the High Court.\u00a0 In the 2014 S.I. (which was struck down by the Courts and replaced by the 2016 SI), this\u00a0appeal was &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; &ndash; this aspect of the provision has been\u00a0removed.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted in this context that Pilot Infringement proceedings by the EU Commission for non-implementation of the EU points system have been taken against Ireland.\u00a0 It remains an option for the EU Commission to proceed to formal infringement proceedings in respect of the licence holders system.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are also serious implications with regard to the release of funding under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).\u00a0\u00a0Implementation of the EU Points system was an ex-ante conditionality for the approval of Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime Fisheries Fund Programme, given that the programme is intended to facilitate implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland.  The EU Commission has signalled in writing that the delivery of funding under Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Operational Programme is firmly linked to the implementation of the points system.  This programme is investing &euro;241m of EU\/Exchequer funding in total in the fisheries sector over the lifetime of the programme, which is crucial at a time of Brexit uncertainty.  The immediate concern is with regard to the control and data collection funds.\u00a0\u00a0The EU Commission wrote in July 2017\u00a0advising that due to the non implementation of the Points system,\u00a0EMFF funding allocated for control spend will be suspended.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the determination of a serious infringements, the S.I. (Regulation 3 of SI No. 125 of 2016) defines &ldquo;serious infringement&rdquo; as \"...an infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy mentioned in Annex XXX to the Commission Regulation that is determined by the Determination Panel, on the balance of probabilities, to be serious having regard to the criteria and guidance notes referred to in Regulation 6(3).\"<\/p>  <p>  Regulation 3 also provides that &ldquo;Commission Regulation&rdquo; means Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 404\/2011 of 8 April 2011 as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015\/1962 of 28 October 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Regulation 6(3) referred to above provides that \"The SFPA may issue guidance notes, which shall be published on its website on the internet, for the purpose of providing practical guidance in identifying the criteria, for the purpose of these Regulations, the Control Regulation and the Commission Regulation, employed in determining whether an infringement is a serious infringement.\"<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the new SI will feature the same definitions.

Data from Pasturebase Ireland indicates that production is running about 1 tonne\u00a0dry matter per hectare\u00a0ahead of last year.  Notwithstanding this, grazing conditions did deteriorate from mid August on farms in the Western regions and on heavier land.  This has given farmers a number of challenging weeks managing livestock with animals having to be temporarily housed and difficulties with securing later cut silage.  I note that there appears to be reasonable supplies of feed and fodder available across the country at present.

In the week beginning 18th September, payments in excess of &euro;160 million issued to over 75,000 farmers, representing a significant increase over the 65,000 paid at the same stage in 2016. <\/p><p>In both the BPS and ANC schemes, payments have continued to issue as additional cases have become clear for payment and the current position with those schemes is that for BPS 116,500 applicants have now been paid &euro;755 million and for ANC over 86,600 applicants have been paid &euro;186 million.<\/p><p>With regard to GLAS, all applications must pass regulatory controls and validations before payment can issue.  Payments are due to commence issuing to applicants in the coming weeks.  I do not expect any payment delays where everything in the application is found to be in order.<\/p><p>The TAMS II Scheme has been very successful to date in terms of uptake with the number of approvals that have issued to date exceeding 11,600.  All of these approvals represent committed expenditure under the TAMS II measure of the Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020. <\/p><p>Of the applications approved just over 2,500 payment claims have been received to date, representing 21% of approvals.  Payment claims submitted have been paid in over 75% of cases and these continue to be paid on an on- going basis.  However, until such time as the works applied for and approved have been completed and payment claims submitted, payments cannot issue. <\/p><p>All participants who have completed approved works are urged to submit their payment claims immediately to facilitate early payment.<\/p><p>Organic Farm Scheme payments in 2015 and 2016 amounted to &euro;8m each year. Projected expenditure for 2017 is &euro;13m and the average payment is approximately &euro;6,500. It is expected that 2016 balancing payments will issue this month.  <\/p><p>Payments have now commenced on the Knowledge Transfer Programme.  The initial payment runs relate to cases where all Year 1 requirements have been fully met by the farmer &ndash; cases where all requirements have been only partially met or where inspections are ongoing will follow shortly. Given the structure of the scheme, farmer payments are now rolling out on a sector by sector basis as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>SECTOR And PAYEE<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>KT   Sheep &ndash; farmer payment - Payment issued<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KT   Beef &ndash; farmer payment - Payment issued<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KT   Dairy &ndash; farmer payment November 2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KT   Tillage &ndash; farmer payment November 2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KT   Equine &ndash; farmer payment November 2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KT   Poultry &ndash; farmer participant November 2017<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In addition to the above schemes, advance payments at a rate of 85% are due to issue later this month to participants in the new Sheep Welfare Scheme. <\/p><p>In relation to all these EU funded schemes, it is important to note that EU regulations stipulate that payments can only issue when the required validation checks have been carried out and passed.  I am very anxious to ensure that my Department continues to issue these important payments to farmers in the most efficient and timely manner possible, and this remains a key priority for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800084#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Imports","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800084#WRH03300"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[47280\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800084#WRH03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which beef or other meat imports from third countries have been evaluated with particular reference their impact on Irish and EU producers; if steps are being taken to safeguard Irish and EU agrifood producers in view of current or potential imports from third countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Notwithstanding challenges on the horizon, amongst which Brexit is paramount, stakeholders in the Irish dairy sector are well placed to benefit from expanding global demand.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland exported in the region of &euro;4bn in dairy products to approaching 130 countries.  Against the backdrop of EU agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada and Japan, my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new 3rd country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products. In many instances such efforts are on foot of trade missions at Ministerial level. Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  In addition, against the background of Brexit, I have asked Bord Bia to conduct market profiling exercise to identify opportunities in new and more mature markets, and the output of this exercise will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers. <\/p>  <p>  Most recent CSO data available for the year to end August showed that growth in Irish dairy exports exceed 20% ahead of the same period in 2016, on foot of factors such as improving global prices, particularly evident in sectors such as butter, but also increases in volumes exported across a range of product categories. This demonstrates that our aforementioned efforts are contributing positively to Irish dairy sector exports. <\/p>  <p>  While global demand for dairy products remains strong, the quality of Irish sourced milk is a key competitive advantage in our promotional efforts in new and existing markets. Investment in research and innovation, improvements in on-farm practices, and the development of added-value products are key priorities for Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector.  My Department will continue to review opportunities for growth in the sector, in collaboration with industry stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I and Minister Doyle led trade missions to China, Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea in September 2016. In November 2016 I also led a trade mission to Morocco, which was extended at senior official level to include Algeria. Earlier in 2016, senior officials accompanied a Bord Bia trade mission to Iran. <\/p>  <p>  In February 2017 I also led a very successful Trade Mission to the Gulf Region.  This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  More recently, in June of this year I led an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico, and will be leading a trade mission to Japan and South Korea later this week.<\/p>  <p>  Such missions serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  They also promote Ireland's reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced dairy products. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy. It has enviable natural resources, adaptable and resilient producers, a strong international reputation, an effective dairy processing sector and a strong core of research infrastructure and expertise. My Department and I will continue to work with our partners in the dairy sector and with EU colleagues and international counterparts to ensure the development and maintenance of a sustainable dairy sector in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800084#WRH05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800084#WRH05900"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[47289\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800084#WRH06000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which his Department continues to monitor the cost of farm inputs with a view to maintaining a livelihood for farm families into the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Indigenous production of cereals is of course an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.  The long-term average cereal production in Ireland is in the region of 2.2 million tonnes per annum and it is desirable to sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The 2017 harvest is estimated by Teagasc to be in the region of 2.1 million tonnes, despite a decrease in the area devoted to tillage.  This is mainly due to the availability of new improved varieties capable of higher yields and thereby helping to sustain a viable tillage sector.  Cereal prices are highly sensitive to global supply and demand and volatility in prices is likely to remain a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future; grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies.  I nonetheless acknowledge the continued tight margins experienced by growers and the challenges facing the sector, as global production due to higher yields continues to outstrip demand. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware of a number of measures I introduced in this regard to sustain the tillage sector and promote its growth in the future.  Among these measures was a targeted crop loss support measure to assist growers most affected by the wet weather harvest conditions of September 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this measure I also introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  I have been advised by the banks that all of the &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018.  Further details will be announced in due course.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>As additional support to tillage farmers I also introduced the\u00a0Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II earlier this year.\u00a0 The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Agricultural\u00a0Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The closing date for applications under the second tranche of the new scheme was Friday 06th   October 2017.\u00a0 There was a significant level of interest in investments under this measure with a total number of 687 applications received to date.  457 approvals have now issued in respect of the first tranche and payments and approvals are issuing on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the level of production, quality and viability of the Irish cereal sector.  These services include seed certification, seed testing, crop variety testing and the publication of recommended lists of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; competitive research programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800084#WRH06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Enterprises","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800085#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[47291\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800085#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which his Department remains committed to the concept of support for the family farm enterprise, having particular regard to particular challenges or threats; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>The 2013  reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was a useful and progressive  reform making the CAP fit for purpose to 2020.\u00a0 It provided Irish farmers and the agri-food sector with policy certainty for the years to come and with strategic financial support to increase sustainability and enhance competitiveness.\u00a0 I will continue to work with my EU colleagues to ensure that we engage in policies that promote the interests of the EU agricultural sector.<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the ten year strategy for the agri-food sector\u00a0published in July 2015 identifies the opportunities and challenges\u00a0facing the entire sector and provides an  enabling strategy that will allow it to grow and prosper.

The Act puts clear obligations on owners regarding the need to look after animals under their care.  Under the Act, authorised officer status has been given to a small number of employees of the ISPCA, DSPCA and the Turf Club to carry out duties limited to welfare.<\/p>  <p>  My Department employs a large team of veterinary inspectors to enforce the provisions of the Act.  Inspections, both announced and unannounced, are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that the requirements of the Act are strictly adhered to.  These inspections are scheduled on both a random and targeted basis.  My Department also operates an anonymous helpline through which members of the public can express animal welfare concerns.  These reports are promptly examined by trained veterinary staff countrywide and corrective action is taken in those cases where the Act has been breached.  The Act also provides for severe penalties in the event of successful prosecutions.<\/p>  <p>  The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) was established by my Department in February 2002 on a non-statutory basis.  It has been instrumental in promoting animal welfare in a practical way and providing a forum for different interest groups to meet, exchange views and reach consensus on the various challenges relating to animal welfare on farms.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department remains the central reporting point for animal welfare concerns, it also works collaboratively on a range of issues with the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Under Section 37(2) of the Animal Health and Welfare Act, 2013, the manager of a local authority may appoint authorised officers to exercise functions conferred on them for the purposes of enforcing the Act.<\/p>  <p>  One area of such co-operation is the governance of canine welfare.  A joint inspection regime of dog breeding establishments, involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Local Authority Veterinary Service, took place in 2015 for the purpose of inspection and follow up action.  While a very high percentage of inspections found the conditions of the animals to comply fully with the Act, corrective action was taken where necessary following the discovery of individual cases of non-compliance (mainly infrastructural in nature).<\/p>  <p>  My Department also liaises on a daily basis with Local Authorities in relation to the enforcement of the Control of Horses Act 1996.  In order to reduce the numbers of straying horses, my Department has provided funding to a number of local authorities to support the development of urban\/traveller horse projects in their respective areas.  A number of projects are currently being progressed by local authorities in conjunction with animal welfare organisations.\u00a0 These projects provide many benefits to communities including educational elements which enable\u00a0greater compliance with animal welfare regulations thereby reducing numbers of straying horses. \u00a0My Department continues to stress that it is the responsibility of individuals to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and\/or their care and to dispose of them appropriately.  I am glad to report a major improvement in horse welfare outcomes in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Horse Welfare Group has recently been instigated by South Dublin County Council to directly address equine issues within the greater Dublin area.

The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees).

The competitive nature of this scheme combined with its flexibility and ability to react to evolving situations are two key strengths in supporting this highly dynamic sector.  An early opening of the scheme is anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Producer Organisation (PO) scheme is also a vital support, with around 80% of Irish mushroom growers in a producer organisation at present.  This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  In addition, this scheme is funding a number of initiatives to improve competitiveness, including Lean Training for mushroom growers.\u00a0 Indeed the concentration of supply through the PO Scheme has allowed exporters in many cases to negotiate Sterling price rises from their UK customers in response to the weakening of Sterling.\u00a0 Other contracts now have an inbuilt mechanism to protect against Sterling volatility or are based in Euro.<\/p>  <p>  I can also confirm that starting in January 2018 An Bord Bia will\u00a0commence a\u00a03-year mushroom promotion campaign on the Irish and UK markets.\u00a0 This\u00a0campaign will be co-funded by the industry and the European Commission.\u00a0 It is important to emphasise that the overall market for mushrooms in the UK and Ireland remains strong, showing good potential for further growth.

On half of farms, either the holder and\/or spouse has off-farm employment.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its food production, and therefore will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets.  Dairy farms, which have significantly higher incomes on average than other farming systems, also experience greater income volatility.  The introduction of fixed price contracts by some processors is increasingly becoming a feature of the producer\/processor relationship in the dairy sector, with numerous milk purchasers offering such contracts, which provide producers with the opportunity to lock in prices over the medium term, taking costs of production into account.  Such relationships are a welcome development in terms of their potential to mitigate volatility.<\/p>  <p>  One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; was such a mechanism and was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), making &euro;150 million available to farmers this year at interest rates of 2.95%.  There has been a very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.<\/p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme announced in Budget 2018, based on the template of the Agri Cashflow Loan scheme, aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses.  Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding (&euro;9 million out of total public funding of &euro;23 million) ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.  Due to State Aid rules, this scheme will not be available to farmers and fishermen.  However, my Department has secured funding of &euro;25 million to facilitate the development of further Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in 2018.  Further details will be announced in due course.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that my Department is taking every step to support measures which mitigate price volatility and improve competitiveness in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800085#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800085#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[47329\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800085#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he will take to have basic payments and ANC payments due to a person (details supplied) issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a\u00a02017\u00a0Basic Payment\/Areas of Natural Constraint Schemes application on 10 May 2017.

The results of this research are a useful contribution to analysis on the issue of income adequacy in general.  This research is an adaptation of the VBSJ&rsquo;s studies on the minimum   essential standard of living for the general population, which have estimated the level of income needed to meet an individual's \/ household's physical, psychological and social needs, and which is calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs. <\/p>  <p>  The findings show that the cost of an MESL is estimated to be higher for a person with vision impairment than for members of the general population who have full sight.  Overall, the additional cost in 2016 for an individual with vision impairment was &euro;44. 54 more than the cost for a single adult in the main MESL (&euro;241. 22).  <\/p>  <p>People with vision impairment who require income support can apply to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection   for a blind person&rsquo;s pension.  This is the only scheme for a specific disability operated by the Department and was introduced almost 100 years ago in 1920.  To be eligible for this payment, the applicant must satisfy a number of conditions set down by legislation:  be at least 18 years of age and under the pension age; be so blind that he or she either cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue his or her ordinary occupation, satisfy a means test, and satisfy the habitual residency condition.  <\/p>  <p>  There are currently some 1,280 people in receipt of a blind person&rsquo;s pension at a cost of some &euro;13. 5 million in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>Alternatively, the disability allowance payment can be claimed by a person with vision impairment   which substantially restricts them in undertaking suitable employment.  The current rate of payment for both the blind person&rsquo;s pension and the disability allowance is &euro;193 per week for a single person.  Budget 2018  provides an additional &euro;5 per week for each of these payments, bringing the rate up to &euro;198 per week next year.  <\/p>  <p>  Primary weekly social welfare payments are intended to enable recipients to meet their basic day-to-day income needs.   Recipients may also be entitled to a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, which are considered secondary in nature.  In this regard, recipients of the blind person&rsquo;s pension or disability allowance may also be entitled to a free travel pass and the household benefits package.  In addition to these, I understand that the Health Service Executive operates a supplement means-tested scheme &ndash; the blind welfare allowance &ndash; for blind people receiving certain welfare payments, including the blind pension.  The current rate of payment is &euro;58. 50 per week for a single person.  <\/p>  <p>  Any further increases in the rates of primary and secondary payments to persons with disabilities including those with vision impairment would have to be considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800086#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800086#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[47323\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800086#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason an appeal for carer's allowance by a person (details supplied) has not been addressed; if the appeal will be expedited; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1345","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>Carer's Allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment, made to a person who is providing full-time care and attention to a person who has a disability such that they require that level of care.<\/p><p>The Department periodically reviews claims in payment to ensure that there is continued entitlement.
