Sometimes they have been so broad that they can annoy the Cathaoirleach.  His depth of knowledge and grasp of many topics, including economics, culture, history and so on, is endless and he has been a great advocate.  He was here for a term before I was elected in 1989.  I understand this is his eighth Seanad.  It is a remarkable achievement.

He has been a formidable debater, orator and political campaigner for topics which were not popular and society did not embrace, and championed them when nobody else would do so.  He has continued to champion many causes which are not popular.  When the bandwagon keeps going on, he is rightly acknowledged as the man who led many of those campaigns.

Many low-income farmers need funding.  We propose that the money be redeployed to them in light of the GLAS shortfall.  This money is needed, but so is something else on which I will call for a debate with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, namely, the reason for the late payments to farmers.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il will also seek a debate on Tusla.  Mandatory reporting is coming in, but Members of this House, their staff and people who are of assistance to those in distress, particularly in child protection matters, have not been given the necessary training to deal with them.  If they do not deal with such matters correctly, they will be in breach of the law.  We need clarification from the Government and the House on how our staff will be trained to deal with the issue of mandatory reporting.  Tusla's CEO has stated that it does not have the requisite resources and is unaware of what processes it needs to have in place.  Some 800 child protection and welfare cases are deemed high priority, yet a social worker has not been allocated to them.  Children who are suffering abuse at this moment are not being dealt with.  We are now going to add a further layer of reporting that is necessary, given what has happened previously, but there is a lack of clarity for Members of the Houses, local councillors, members of the Garda and so on as to what they have to do to comply with the law.<br\/><br\/>I ask that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, attend the House as soon as possible to outline what she is going to do.  If Senators get phone calls and do not deal with them properly, they could be charged with breaking the law.  More importantly, as with the case of Garda Sergeant McCabe, how should we deal with spurious allegations?  People can make vexatious claims against people for the worst of motives.  What would happen in such cases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#G00900","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>How quickly 30-odd years pass.

It was founded by Mr. Jim Dowson, an anti-abortion campaigner and Christian fundamentalist who is closely associated with Ulster loyalism.  That is who we are dealing with.  Britain First campaigns against multiculturalism and believes in direct actions such as carrying out \"Christian patrols\".  It believes in mosque invasions.

They want to bring back the death penalty.<\/p> <p>I agree with what Mr. Jeremy Corbyn said when he called on the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, to condemn President Donald Trump's tweets, which I am glad she has done.

That is what these groups are.<\/p> <p>As it is incumbent on all European leaders to do so, will the Leader call on the Taoiseach to make a strong statement condemning the President of the United States for aligning himself so openly with the worst far-right fascism?

Yes, if there is a sort of secular canonisation, then that is what is going on here today, but it is well deserved.  The Senator has indeed been inspirational, as others have said.  It has been a real pleasure for me personally to have served alongside him for the past ten years as Senators on the Dublin University panel, and I cannot believe it has been that long.  He has served the constituents from the Dublin University panel so well over that time, and for the 20 years before that.  He has followed a long line of progressive Trinity Senators, including Catherine McGuinness and Owen Sheehy-Skeffington.His pioneering work on his own account, both before and after his original election in 1987, has to be commended, particularly his immense bravery and courage in taking the case Norris <i>v<\/i>. Attorney General.  This led to what has been described as the worst Supreme Court judgment ever, in which his case was at first dismissed by the Supreme Court.  Famously, of course, it was then allowed by the European Court of Human Rights in Norris <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, and led to the historic lifting of the ban on homosexuality in 1993.  However, it would not have happened without the original act of courage that he so poignantly spoke about in our recent series in Trinity on legal cases that changed Ireland.  I must say, it was a real privilege to hear him speak so movingly about that experience.  I do not wish in any way to undermine it, because it took immense bravery to take on the Irish State in the mid-1980s, a time when the State was so repressive towards LGBT people, women and in respect of matters of sexuality generally.<\/p><p>On a lighter note, I join others in wishing the Senator very well for 30 more years to come.  It is not just a matter of the past but an ongoing pleasure to work with the Senator, as we did on Tuesday night in this House, when we concluded Committee Stage of historic legislation on domestic violence.  I look forward to the Report Stage debate today.  Senator Norris was among those who pressed hard for introduction of the new offence of coercive control, which the Minister of State introduced on Tuesday night.  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Norris on this and other important legislation.<\/p><p>I will finish by stating a view Senator Norris would share.  I condemn the new low by US President Donald Trump in retweeting those absolutely disgusting fascist videos from Britain First.  These Islamophobic videos have rightly been condemned all across the world.I join with others in calling on the Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to express Ireland's condemnation of that particular action.

He is an absolute gentleman as an individual and a great colleague and friend.  He is a polymath who makes huge contributions to the Seanad across a range of issues, cultural, social, economic, legal and so on.  His pioneering, mould-breaking and hugely change-making work in the area of establishing gay rights in this country cannot be understated.  He deserves great credit from all of us and we are proud to have him as a colleague.  He does a lot for the Seanad on a number of levels.<\/p><p>Many mainstream reliable British media sources are today reporting that there has been something of a breakthrough in the UK position on Brexit.  There are reports that they are coming up with the divorce payment, but more importantly from an Irish context, there are reports that they are now willing to go without regulatory divergence on the Border, and at least acknowledge the Border issue in the negotiations in a serious fashion.  That is a great breakthrough.  The stated Irish position is that we want to maintain the customs union and the <i>status quo<\/i>.  If we cannot do that, we want to establish the closest possible situation to that on an all-Ireland basis.  We are working towards that. <\/p><p>In the constituency I come from, Cavan-Monaghan, there is a huge risk of a dislocation of jobs in the food processing sector, in agriculture and right across a range of areas if we do not achieve this.  I am very committed to it.  I ask the Leader that before our Taoiseach goes to the next critical summit to decide if we move to the next phase of the negotiations on Brexit, that we have a debate in this House and consider this issue again.  Colleagues from all sides in this House have done some great pioneering work on the Brexit question.  I appeal to the Leader to do that.  It is important that we do and the Leader has a very definite commitment in this regard because he has given me personal assurances on it on a number of occasions.  We cannot put up to 40,000 people out of work in this State over Brexit.

This remains the most significant and challenging issue in regard to sustainable agriculture and farming enterprises, not only on the whole island of Ireland but also across the rest of the European Union.  It is very important that we continue to attract new entrants to agriculture.  I suggest, therefore, that we have a discussion on the Common Agricultural Policy for the period after 2020 in terms of how we can deliver better standards, fairer opportunities and equal opportunities for those who wish to derive their principal income from agriculture, forestry and horticulture.  The sector is very significant in this country, but also across Europe.  In addition, I stress the importance of the European Union.  We must call on our colleagues and stand in solidarity with the farmers across the Union, especially regarding how the post-Brexit scenario will affect the Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p><p>I wish Senator Norris continued good health.

Thankfully he and, it is to be hoped, many of them came through it.  It has been a pleasure to serve with him for my short period here.  Hopefully, someday I might make that milestone and Senator Norris may still even be here.<\/p> <p>On a more serious note, I wish to concur with much of what Senator O'Reilly has said.  I reiterate that we are in a two-week period in which we will face one of the biggest decisions that will influence the future of this country.  I am taken aback by media and political commentary from the United Kingdom over the past 24 to 48 hours in particular.  If it was not so serious it would have been funny last night, where three or four people were picked on television, probably from 100 who were interviewed, to draw a line on the map of Ireland to show where the North was.  We saw where those lines were drawn.  That was a British media spin in conjunction with the British Government and it is a full-on drive by the English to portray Ireland as not counting and that ordinary English people do not even know where the Border is.  They are adopting a divide and conquer approach.  We need to take the same stance.  I am not asking for any Minister who has anything to do with Brexit to come in here for the next two weeks because they need to be where they need to be.  We need to make our stance, dig in and put on the green jersey for the next two weeks.  There is no point in having a debate like Members did yesterday on losing a banking institute on the toss of a coin.  Crying over spilled milk will do no good.  We need our media to come out fighting and take the same attitude.  We can get headlines in newspapers in America over trivial things.  The world's media need to see that Ireland is important.  The genuine people of England, when there is no spin involved and when it is not being orchestrated and stage managed, do know where the Border is and do know where Ireland is.  I note DUP politicians came out with a similar line this morning with a portrayal that all that is wrong with us is that we have a chip on our shoulder because of what has gone before in history.  One and all here in Ireland, political, media and the man in the street, need to put on the green jersey for the next two weeks and we do not need to have any regrets when the summit is over on 14 December.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#L00100","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>By way of clarification, if I heard the Senator correctly, did he say he was seconding Senator Mark Daly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#L00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I asked that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine be called into the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#L00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Senator Paul Daly supported that call but, to clarify, there was no formal amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#L00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I formally propose that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#L00500","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>The Senator cannot propose it now.

No one is worthier in this Chamber because it is a special day for Senator Norris.  Many other Members know him much better and much longer and are much more authoritative in their assertions.

As a voice for progress and voice for social justice in Ireland he and I are very much at one.<\/p> <p>Given the subject matter and the contributions in recent weeks and months, I bring to Members' attention the Gaelic Voices For Change initiative.  Past and present GAA county players will sleep out to raise awareness of the escalating housing and homeless crisis in Ireland.  The event is supported by the Gaelic Players Association and the Women's Gaelic Players Association.  They have announced that sleep-outs will take place in Dublin, Belfast, Portlaoise, Galway, Cork, Limerick, and Carlow.  More locations will be announced in the coming days.  Players and squads wishing to register can do so online until next Monday.  They are also looking for help and volunteer action in respect of tea and coffee, food, sleeping bags, music and everything else that can be done to assist them to highlight a serious issue that blights our society.  As we head into the Christmas period in particular, though it should always be to the fore of our minds, it shows an example of the best of the GAA and that Gaelic ethos that county players, both current and former from across the various codes, are queuing up to take part in this initiative on 16 December.  I am flagging this to Members to encourage them to look out for it in their local area and to lend it whatever support they can and to allow it to act as a reminder to us who actually have a degree of influence and political clout to do more in respect of our homelessness crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#L01000","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I join with all my colleagues in congratulating our good friend and Father of the House on his 30 years and seven months.

Congratulations, David.  I thank the Senator for all of the good that he does and I hope he will continue his good work.<\/p><p>I do not know whether David would agree with me on the following.  I know that he has been a critic of the abuses perpetrated by the media from time to time.  I do not know what he thinks of the report produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the proposed broadcasting charge.  I think it is a very serious development.  We had a situation where the Minister, in a previous Government, thought about introducing a broadcasting charge but the idea appeared to wane.  The report seems to put the idea very much back on the agenda.<\/p><p>The idea of expanding the term television set to include laptops, computers and, potentially, iPads would mean that even if a person does not consume televised content and instead opted for Netflix or got news by reading online newspapers, he or she would still be forced to pay an RT&Eacute; tax even if he or she never used its services.  Virtually every person in the country has a computer, a laptop or an iPad for work or day-to-day communications.  If the licence fee is re-designed to apply to virtually every person in the country whether they watch television or not then we should be honest with the public.  We should tell them that the Minister is introducing a new tax and not a fee for using a particular service.  To confirm that suspicion the committee has recommended that the Revenue Commissioners should collect the new broadcast tax.  Such an initiative would completely ignore how people consume entertainment and information.  It is extraordinary to suggest that a person with no television who has a paid online subscription to an entertainment service like Netflix or an online subscription to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, for example, would be forced to pay for services provided by RT&Eacute; that the person might neither want nor use.  The initiative will distort the media market in Ireland and create real difficulties for online content providers.  It would also be deeply anti-competitive.<\/p><p>Is it fair to be obliged to pay for the television programme called &quot;Fair City&quot;?  I have no problem will allocating money from the public purse for particular services that the likes of RT&Eacute; could provide.  One could put a value on RT&Eacute;'s news service, for example, the &quot;Six One News&quot;, and allocate a certain amount of millions of euro.  One could pay for &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot; if it is considered to have significant public merit.  The idea that RT&Eacute; would continue to enjoy the double advantage of both having State funding and being able to earn hundreds of millions in advertising revenue is still unfair.  RT&Eacute; has 2,000 staff who earn &euro;53,000 per year on average.  Frankly, RT&Eacute; has a track record of bias on a range of issues that it has done little to address.  It is not right to introduce a new means of taxation when RT&Eacute; has been forced to admit that some of its presenters are paid between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 per year.  RT&Eacute; has often been found out by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for its lack of fairness and impartiality.  There has been no talk of reform.  Instead, there has been talk about giving RT&Eacute; a special new stealth tax.  I do not think that the Irish public will stand for a new tax and I certainly do not think it is fair.  I would be grateful if the Leader could arrange a debate on the topic<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#M00600","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I want to be associated with all of the good wishes extended to Senator Norris.

We must work together in the United Kingdom and Europe to ensure that whatever happens is as good a deal for the United Kingdom, Europe and ourselves.  We are in a very eventful situation for the future of the island of Ireland and, if it is handled right, we can influence things not just in the UK and Europe but around the world.

This is the national movement of the world's largest male-led campaign to end men's violence against women, with a presence in more than 60 countries,.  I spoke in Carlow College this week as part of an action day for the campaign and I was reminded of a quote of Oscar-winning actor Jeff Bridges: \"It's not enough to just treat women well.  We have to work to make sure all men treat women well.\"  The aims of the white ribbon campaign are to encourage education and leadership in order to change the attitudes and behaviour that lead to men's violence against women by educating boys and men to lead social change and to achieve gender equality.

I served with Tras Honan, Sean Fallon as Cathaoirleach, Se&aacute;n Doherty, Liam Cosgrave, Liam Naughten, who was tragically killed in a car crash, Senator Paddy Burke, who was here earlier and was a wonderful Cathaoirleach, Pat Moylan, Rory Kiely and the current Cathaoirleach, who has been one of the best Cathaoirligh because, although he comes from a Fianna F&aacute;il background, he has shown complete political indifference and has treated everybody extremely fairly.  There have been many fine Leaders of the House, including the current holder of that office, Senator Buttimer, who has done a very distinguished job.  There have been other Leaders, such as Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who I was very sorry to see have to leave ministerial office this week, and Maurice Manning, who is another very fine person.<\/p> <p>I was glad to be in a position to help in a fairly significant way to save the Seanad.

Senator Norris is renowned for his Joycean scholarship.  A Joyce quote I like and which I think pertains to the Senator is: \"As I am.  As I am.  All or not at all\".  That encapsulates Senator Norris: one can fight, argue, debate or socialise with him but he is who he is, all or not at all.  There can be no ambiguity or anything to say other than that Senator Norris is a scholar, as politician, a person of independence of mind and a champion of civil rights for over four decades.

It is regrettable that there are members of the Defence Forces and their families outside the gates of the Oireachtas today.  However, it is worth setting the record straight in so far as there has been a record level of recruitment in recent times, with 800 people recruited this year.  This is the second year in a row that there has been a cadet class of 100.  Last year, more people joined the Defence Forces than left it and Senator Craughwell should remember that.  The pay rates for members of the Defence Forces have begun to increase.<\/p> <p>When Senators speak about the Defence Forces it is important to remember and acknowledge the role that those men and women play in our country and across the world.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to them and their families for the service they have given.  They are entitled to pay restoration, which is taking place, and pay increases, which are being made and will continue to be made.  It is equally important to recognise that the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, are committed to resolving the issues raised by many Senators this morning and on an ongoing basis.  In the context of the members of the Defence Forces who, unfortunately, are in receipt of family income supplement, although we accept none should be, only 1.3% of the Defence Forces are currently in receipt of it.  Let us, and Senators Craughwell and Leyden in particular, be objective about this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I could take a party political position on this issue but I will not do so because it relates to the Defence Forces for whom we have great respect.  We want pay restoration to continue.  It is important, therefore, that we continue to work collectively to ensure this is achieved and the Defence Forces are given due recognition.  I remember when family members of Defence Forces members ran in general elections against Senator Leyden's party.  He should cast his mind back to that.<br\/><br\/>I accept Senator Paul Daly's amendment to the Order of the Business.  While I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to debate the important matter the Senator raised, he cannot do so today.  I ask the Senator to accept a debate on the issue on Tuesday instead.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mark Daly referred to rural development, GLAS payments and the need to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.  Certain remarks were attributed to the agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan.  I would be happy to have a debate on the issue in the coming weeks.  I will not give a long-winded answer on the issues the Senator raised but it will be important to have a debate. <br\/><br\/>I join Senators Bacik, Gavan and Norris in condemning the tweets, remarks and inferences of President Trump.  This type of rhetoric, whether in a tweet, comment or speech, has no place in society or a modern democracy.  We must promote integration and brotherhood and sisterhood, rather than dividing nations and people.  The remarks were ill-tempered and have no place in politics.  All of us should condemn them and I am glad Prime Minister May condemned them this morning.  It beggars belief that President Trump can be allowed to continue to make such remarks.  I know we live in a democracy and we have freedom of speech and thought but the President's behaviour was outlandish.  I have no interest in seeing anyone trying to condone it because it cannot be condoned. <br\/><br\/>Senators O'Reilly, Paul Daly and Feighan raised the issue of Brexit, on which I will be pleased to facilitate a debate.  I was endeavouring to have a debate on Brexit next week but the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, will be away next week.  Perhaps we can find a means of having this important debate, which was outlined very well in the contributions of Senators.  The Brexit negotiations are critical to the country.  As we all know, the issue of the island of Ireland is fundamentally important in the negotiations and Irish people, North and South, and the Government are very cognisant of this.  We cannot place in jeopardy the cross-Border co-operation taking place in 141 separate areas.  We cannot put North-South relations and the entire island at risk.  I commend Senators on offering their support on this issue and on the positive, affirming and determined rhetoric they used this morning.  This is about us, as a nation, North and South, standing together from the point of view of trade, integration and people.  For example, 40% of the milk processed in Ireland goes back and forth across the Border and 100,000 cattle cross the Border to be finished.  Brexit will have profound impacts on economics, tourism, Border communities and the island as a whole.  I will try to arrange a debate for next week or the week after.<br\/><br\/>I join Senators, in particular, Senator Lombard, on congratulating my colleague and friend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, on his appointment as T&aacute;naiste.  His appointment is a tremendous honour for him personally, the Fine Gael Party in Cork South-Central, of which both he and I are members, and County Cork.  The county now has its second T&aacute;naiste, after the late Peter Barry.  I will not go as far as Senator O'Sullivan in calling for another Cork man to be Taoiseach.  I hope the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will continue in their roles and the latter will be joined in the D&aacute;il by a willing accomplice and candidate in Cork South-Central.  The appointment is a tremendous honour for the T&aacute;naiste and his family and I congratulate him, Ruth, his wife, and members of his extended family.<br\/><br\/>I also wish the Minister, Deputy Josepha Madigan, every success in her new role.  She is a formidable and excellent Member of the Lower House where she has, as previous speakers stated, made a significant contribution.  I wish her well.  I also congratulate the new Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, on her appointment.  Given the importance of Brexit, her position in an economic Ministry highlights the need for continuing dialogue on the Border region.  I wish her well in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I will be happy to have a debate on electricity, as requested by Senator Paddy Burke.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gabrielle McFadden raised a disturbing issue related to Simon Community accommodation in the midlands.  Perhaps it would be addressed quicker if raised as a Commencement matter but I will try to arrange a debate. <br\/><br\/>I join Senator<b><\/b>&Oacute; Donnghaile in congratulating Gaelic Voices for Change on its sleep-out to highlight the issue of homelessness.  We should all highlight this important issue, on which we can expect the Government to take further action.  Visibility is also required.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mullen raised the licence fee and RT&Eacute;.  He has raised this issue previously and I am aware that the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, considered the possibility of introducing a broadcasting charge.  I do not necessarily agree with the Senator on the issue of &quot;Fair City&quot; because it is important that we have home produced drama and other productions, not least because they create employment for people in the arts community.  However, the Senator makes a good point on the use of the television licence fee.  I do not fully agree with RT&Eacute;'s editorial policy or production ideas but it is important that, as the State broadcaster, the organisation is independent.  If I am correct, the Senator asked that we examine how RT&Eacute; spends income from the licence fee.  In the modern era, people use various devices such as iPads and smartphones to watch television.  I will probably be accused of being a spoilsport but perhaps we need to consider reducing the licence fee and having a different type of fee.  The Government is examining this issue on which we need to have a debate.  I accept the point the Senator made.<br\/><br\/>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the important issue of domestic violence, specifically violence by men against women and the white ribbon campaign.  We all agree on the need to eradicate domestic violence.  In recent weeks, we have seen controversies involving behaviour that we cannot condone.  This matter is also of major importance.  The House had a strong debate on the Domestic Violence Bill and it is important that we work to eliminate all types of mistreatment or inequality. <br\/><br\/>On the day that we pay tribute to Senator Norris, we also remember Patrick Kavanagh.  I was tempted earlier to quote to Senator Norris the following line from Kavanagh that I like - &quot;Every old man I see in October-coloured weather&quot; - but I did not wish to suggest he is in an old man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#O01700","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>At 73 years of age, I am an old man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#P00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>While Senator Norris may not be a father, he is the father of the House and, to be fair to him, he has been a father to all of us.<\/p> <p>Senators Colm Burke and James Reilly raised the general practitioner contract, an important issue on which we need to have a debate.<\/p> <p>I hope Senators will allow a change to the Order of Business next Tuesday and thank them in advance for doing so.

In September, I opened the national HIV conference hosted by HIV Ireland which focused on this stigma.  The conference examined how the stigma of HIV\/AIDS is an additional burden on the lives of people living with a diagnosis.  People living with HIV can face judgment, rejection and hurt.  HIV Ireland&rsquo;s survey shows that one in four are not comfortable with their own HIV positive status, one in three have been rejected in a relationship due to their HIV status and worryingly almost one in five people living with HIV felt suicidal in the past year.  The challenges for people living with a diagnosis cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>Stigma can also be a barrier to talking about HIV and getting tested but when we create a safe space to talk about HIV, we protect everybody.  The opportunity to talk to the House here today helps raise awareness of AIDS and helps us to confront the challenges of this disease.  Sharing knowledge and information are important to our prevention and health promotion strategies that act to protect people from infection.  The reality is that a diagnosis of HIV for a person has a long-term impact on their lives but we must strive to reinforce HIV education, awareness, prevention, testing and treatment.  It is undeniable that these are all important aspects of dealing with the challenges of HIV.  <\/p> <p>I welcomed the recent publication by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HIV in Ireland report for 2016.  It showed a reduction in the number of diagnoses by 6% in 2016 when those with a previous HIV diagnosis were excluded but there is always concern that accompanies chronic diseases such as HIV.<\/p> <p>I remain concerned at the number of HIV diagnoses in 2016.  Just over half of these 508 new diagnoses were among men who have sex with men and this group remains the most affected by HIV in Ireland.  We must focus on dealing with the level of infection of this at-risk cohort.<\/p> <p>The publication of our first national Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020 provided the opportunity to ensure that all efforts across the entire range of sexual health - from awareness, education, training, access, treatment and surveillance - are co-ordinated, evidence-informed and based on best practice.  We continue to implement our national sexual health strategy in this context.  The strategy itself is set within Healthy Ireland, the national framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of the country over the coming generation.  Implementation of the strategy is in all of our interests.<\/p> <p>The national sexual health strategy has been developed against a backdrop of a changing Ireland regarding sexual behaviour and sexuality in recent decades.  This changing landscape is evident in legislation introduced in recent years, and more openness generally in attitudes and culture around sexuality and sexual health issues.  <\/p> <p>The strategy was developed based on three goals.  Everyone in Ireland will receive comprehensive and age-appropriate sexual health education and information and will have access to appropriate prevention and promotion services.  Equitable, accessible and high-quality sexual health services, which are targeted and tailored to need, will be available to everyone, and robust and high quality sexual health information will be generated to underpin policy, practice, service planning and strategic monitoring.  The strategy recognises the diversity of sexual identities.  It supports all expressions of sexual identity through positive sexual health and wellbeing outcomes.  Governance structures for implementation of the national sexual health strategy have been established.  The HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme is the national programme charged with developing and implementing a national strategy to, among other things, improve the effectiveness and impact of sexual health services and preventative work.  The programme is responsible for developing and implementing an action plan for each year of the strategy.  A clinical lead for sexual health has also been appointed in the HSE.<\/p> <p>The HSE sexual health action plan for this year specifies a range of actions being taken under the auspices of the national sexual health strategy.  These include: actions related to clinical services such as completing and implementing outstanding practice guidance for HIV testing in various settings, including home HIV testing, point of care HIV testing; and the use of antiretroviral therapy in HIV prevention to include pre-exposure prophylaxis, known as PrEP, treatment as prevention and post exposure prophylaxis.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to advise the House that a HSE recommendation on antiretroviral therapy for all people living with HIV in Ireland was signed off by the HSE leadership team on the 25 July.  The HSE recommends that all HIV infected individuals attending HIV services in Ireland are offered antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible and informed of the benefits of antiretroviral therapy in improving their personal health and reducing HIV infectiousness.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This was circulated to clinical services and community organisations and is available on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre website.  A patient information leaflet has been prepared in English, Portuguese, French and Spanish and has been sent to all clinics providing care to people living with HIV.<\/p><p>A HSE multisectoral PrEP working group is continuing to work on recommendations around the introduction of PrEP in Ireland.  Work to date includes a report on the estimated number of people likely to avail of PrEP in Ireland in the first year, which has been submitted to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, and the development of national standards for the delivery of HIV prevention and PrEP care.<\/p><p>I also want to mention the Know Now project, which is a community HIV testing project.  It has been successful in reaching people, particularly men who have sex with men, who have never been previously tested for HIV.  During the pilot in 2016, a total of 1,465 tests were conducted in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.<\/p><p>The report of the third annual Healthy Ireland Survey of 7,500 people aged 15 and over and living in Ireland is directly relevant to this.  It gives an up-to-date picture of the health of the nation and reports on many lifestyle behaviours such as sexual health.  The Healthy Ireland Survey reported that over the past year, 21% of respondents reported having had a HIV test during their lifetime, 12% of men who have sex with men had a HIV test in the past 12 months, and 28% of men who have sex with men have had a test during their lifetime.  This is the first time we have asked about HIV and sexually transmitted infection, STI, testing in this kind of survey.  I am pleased to note that most people were happy to answer these questions and give us this information.  This is indeed a welcome development.  We also know that younger people, especially men who have sex with men, are an important at-risk group, and the survey shows that these were more likely to have had a test.  Again, this shows that the stigma around testing is probably reducing and that our work to make testing more accessible is having an impact.<\/p><p>Surveillance is also crucial for this infectious disease, and HIV monitoring and reporting have improved over the past year.  This is in line with meeting Ireland's obligations to report on our national response to the HIV epidemic to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control as part of the Dublin Declaration Partnership to Fight HIV\/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia, and to UNAIDS-WHO as part of the UN General Assembly Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS.  The HSE has advised my Department that Ireland is in the top ten in Europe on achieving the target that 90% of those estimated to be living with HIV are on treatment.  This is indeed welcome.<\/p><p>Actions related to communications and information in the HSE sexual health action plan include the provision of targeted information and campaigns to at-risk groups and a communications working group targeted at men who have sex with men is now in place under this heading.  Members include representatives from the Gay Men's Health Service, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, and the Gay Health Network.  The latter is a network of organisations and individuals in Ireland providing the national resources, response, support and expert network for the promotion of HIV prevention and of sexual health and well-being for gay and bisexual men and for and men who have sex with men.<\/p><p>We know that enormous progress has been made in the treatment of people infected with HIV.  Earlier testing and treatment mean that life expectancy is similar to that of the general population, thus bringing it into the realm of chronic diseases.  Such therapies aside, however, the key challenge is to prevent the disease from occurring in the first place.  HIV-AIDS is, after all, a life-changing disease.  We must work together to strengthen the prevention arm of our national sexual health strategy in this context.<\/p><p>I want to emphasise another point to the House.  The close working relationship and engagement of voluntary and community groups with the HSE sexual health crisis pregnancy programme and its national clinical director have been central to the implementation of our national sexual health strategy.  This partnership helps to strengthen the implementation of the strategy, which is having an effect on dealing with the challenges of HIV.  We have more work to do in this area.  We must protect our population and especially at-risk groups from infection.  I assure the House that my Department and the HSE are working closely with our partners in the voluntary and community sector to deal with this.  Efforts will continue in line with our strategic perspective and policy enshrined in our national sexual health strategy.<\/p><p>I will finish by saying that I have visited many services in my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for the national drugs strategy and I have been very impressed by the work being done on the ground, particularly by community groups, to remember above all those who, sadly, have passed away from HIV.  I have also been impressed by the work being done to educate young people to protect themselves, especially when it comes to sexual activity.  The celebration of World Aids Day tomorrow, first introduced by the United Nations on 1 December 1988, is very important to the Government, to the Department of Health, and indeed to all of us here.  It is very important that we as a nation continue to do more than our best to make sure that there will be no stigma around HIV in the future.  Above all we must protect those with HIV and ensure that they live lives as long and healthy as the rest of the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#Q00700","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512037800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I call Senator Ned O'Sullivan.

We had a very pleasant session here just now as we complimented our colleague, Senator Norris, on reaching a very important milestone as the longest serving Senator in the history of the country.  He and people like him did fantastic work to remove the stigma that existed around homosexuality in this country and offered great courage and leadership at a time when there was not such understanding and tolerance as there is today.  I am sure that there are thousands of people in this country today who owe Senator Norris the fine, open lives that they have been able to lead as gay people.<\/p> <p>It is fitting that we should be discussing AIDS today.

We commemorate World Aids Day to mourn the deaths of more than 35 million people who have died as a result of HIV, a number which rivals that of lives lost in the First World War, remarkable as that seems.  This occasion also serves as a way to spread awareness and knowledge of the disease and, finally, as a mark of solidarity towards the tens of millions of people who are fighting the disease all over the world today, including almost 8,000 in Ireland alone.<\/p> <p>Under the slogan \"Everybody Counts\", the World Health Organization will advocate for access to safe, effective, high-quality and affordable medicines, including medicines, diagnostics and other health commodities as well as health care services for people in need, while also ensuring that they are protected against financial risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017113000002#R00500","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512037800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
