I will say a couple of things about where I come from because it will very much guide my remarks to the committee.  I am the director of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies which is hosted by the WHO, the European Commission, the World Bank and a number of member states in Europe.  Ireland is part of it and so are Switzerland, England and many others, including the Nordic countries.  I am not doing marketing for my organisation, but rather trying to give a sense of where I am coming from.  Our job is to gather and compare evidence.  One aspect of that, which may be of help to the committee, is that we have been doing a number of comparative studies to develop evidence and work with policy makers in their role.  We are concerned with knowledge brokering and how we use evidence in a way that is practical for work.  As the English say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating so I will tell the committee what I have to say today.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to do two things and I will ask for the committee's suggestions.  The first is to give the committee a sense of how Ireland looks in the international and European context against a series of measures of performance.  I will not make it an academic exercise but try to draw lessons about what we can learn from other countries in the region.  In addition to that, I will suggest a possible framework - not a normative framework - to think through the various issues the committee is concerned with.  My terms of reference, like those of the committee, were very wide.  It would take me several hours to go through all the areas the committee is looking at and which are in my terms of reference.  There are two ways to go about it.  I will not subject the committee to all my slides.  They are a background so that I can answer the committee's questions with evidence.  There are two ways to go about it.  One is to have a bit of a menu in ten minutes of introduction and then go into detail on any of the areas the committee wishes me to address.  The second way is that we could go into each of the areas.  For instance, we could start by looking at funding issues, supplementary ways of financing, or the role of the private sector.  We could also talk about the skill mix.  Many of these areas are in the committee's terms of reference.  I could take them one by one and we could then stop and divide them.  I will do whatever is best for the committee.  The slides have been distributed to members of the committee but they should not worry, I will not go through all of them.  I will use them as a background to be able to address questions with actual evidence.  <\/p> <p>  I congratulate members for putting this committee together.  One of the things we have learnt elsewhere is the need to have some stability in the reform process.  The idea of putting a multi-party committee together to create consensus is a very wise decision that I wish would happen in many other countries in the region where we work.  The second aspect is that what the health care system is facing is not only an Irish issue, it is an issue across the region.  Two days ago I was in Helsinki presenting to a committee similar to this one with senior policy makers and civil servants where we did an evaluation of the health system reforms there.  Many of the issues we addressed there were very similar.<\/p> <p>  Another concept I will refer to a lot today is that of specificity and what academics call path dependency.  There is no such thing as a technical decision that applies to all countries even if academics like certain ways.  It has to be very much tied to the history and the system.  I am sorry for these long preliminary comments but, as I said, I could do ten minutes and give the committee the menu.  Perhaps I could even start with my conclusions and then ask members to push me to any of the areas I have mentioned or I can take it area by area, whatever the committee prefers.  I hope I am not being too informal in my approach to the committee.  I hope it is okay that I do it this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Perhaps Dr. Figueras should give an initial presentation on how Ireland rates relative to other European countries in terms of our health care system and then we might go through it area by area.

As the committee can see there is a lot of data in my presentation.  I will start by discussing whether Ireland is getting value for money.  What do the indicators look like in comparison and how much is being spent?  One of my slides shows the percentage of health care expenditure against GDP.  It is typical of most presentations on the subject so it will be no surprise that Ireland's health care expenditure as a percentage of GDP is so low.  I got one of my research fellows to update all our figures and data for this meeting so the slides I have given to the committee contain the most recent data from the WHO, the OECD, EUROSTAT and so on.  The available data is from 2014 and 2015.  I will be very happy if the Chairman wants me to give a detailed analysis of expenditure trends.  I have the figures here so we can go back to that.<\/p> <p>  Life expectancy is the other main indicator but I have other indicators such as preventable mortality and avoidable mortality, which we can come back to later if the committee wishes.  Life expectancy in Ireland is above the average in OECD countries.  The committee will see the data for women on the left and the data for men on the right.  I looked at these figures with a colleague and it is interesting to see that healthy life years in Ireland are higher than in other countries.  Ireland is above the average.<\/p> <p>  If the committee looks at the data for healthy life years, it will see that life expectancy is broken down into healthy life years and life with activity limitations.  That is how that is measured.  It is quite high, which is a really interesting element.  I have more data on a form of benchmarking that looks at issues of life expectancy and risk factors.  It will remind the committee that Ireland has challenges with regard to obesity.  It is a reminder because the committee knows this very well.  Despite this challenge, Ireland was the first country to introduce a novel tobacco ban.  Many countries followed Ireland and used its example and research.  Ireland still has challenges with regard to tobacco and alcohol.<\/p> <p>  I am very familiar with the Healthy Ireland strategy.  One of the elements I would like to talk about later on is how that relates to other health policies and approaches in Europe.  In terms of cardiovascular diseases, Ireland has made huge, amazing improvements that explain improvements in the life expectancy figures.  There is a mixed picture but one that shows Ireland is going in the right direction.  Researchers never manage to get the data for amenable mortality right.  It is an indicator that is meant to look at mortality that would be amenable for health care services.  There is amenable and preventable mortality.  It is terribly difficult to disentangle mortality that can be addressed through the health system from mortality that is addressed by determinants.  This data is an attempt to do that.  As the committee can see from the slide, there has been a measured improvement.<\/p><p>The green pertains to 2014 and the pale pink to 2000.  One can see the huge improvements.  Ireland is fairly low down the ranking in terms of amenable mortality for both males and males.  A lower ranking is more positive.  With females, interestingly, the ranking is a bit higher.  We ought to be very cautious about how we interpret some of these data.  Let us not attach too much importance to them.  They help to give a sense of what is occurring, however.  Ireland's health services are doing pretty well if we take the data as an indicator of their impact.<\/p><p> I will return to the issue of preventable mortality.  Is it satisfactory for me to give an overview and then refer to the options?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#G00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I really want to tackle the members' questions but an overview could be helpful.  I shall return to the indicators in a minute, if members wish.<br\/><br\/>Consider the question of whether value for money is being obtained.  The relevant slide is very simple and I do not like its approach but it is still fairly solid.  On the vertical axis is health expenditure and on the horizontal axis is amenable mortality for males and females. <b><\/b>I refer to mortality that is amenable to health care.  Is value for money being obtained?  The vertical line shows countries such as Luxembourg, France, Belgium and Ireland, which is clearly pointed out, and also Finland, Italy, Spain and Cyprus.  They are all on the line that shows relatively low levels of amenable mortality for males.  For the same amount of money, there is a huge variation.  One could argue, therefore, that Ireland could be lower down and get the same levels as Spain, Italy or Cyprus, for instance.  That is an indictment of the data, however, because the system in Cyprus still does require a fair number of reforms, yet it has low levels of amenable mortality. I should be cautious in saying this.  Perhaps this measure of the impact of the health system may also be affected by diet and lifestyle factors.  Cyprus, which is in the Mediterranean, has a very good diet, as with the Greeks. If one makes a comparison with the countries on the right of the graph, such as Portugal, the Czech Republic, Estonia and some others, one can see they do not spend very much money per person and have higher levels of mortality.<br\/><br\/>That is an overall picture of Irish life expectancy, health outcomes and risk factors.  I will discuss this area for ten minutes and then I will be happy to answer questions on the details.  My job is to reflect with the members on how international comparisons can help them to think about how to proceed.  The questions in the data are very much the ones faced by Ireland and elsewhere.<br\/><br\/>The EOHSP's approach is the one it has been using for other countries.  Consider the question of whether Ireland should reform its statutory funding system.  I refer to the debate on taxation and social health insurance.  Clearly, the experiences with competing insurers have not been very positive.  I will be very happy to discuss in detail the Czech and Dutch experiences.  I know these very well because I participated in the reform evaluations.  Perhaps this debate should be on whether Ireland should reform its general tax system or its social health insurance system.<br\/><br\/>What we say, in a slightly superficial tone which I hope the members do not mind, is that it is not a matter of a Bismarck or Beveridge system.  Both Otto von Bismarck and Beveridge are dead.  The current debate is not about social health insurance versus taxation but about whether the system is sustainable, efficient to administer and flexible in a crisis.  I have a fair amount of experience of how various systems in Europe have reacted in times of crisis in terms of compensating for the shortfalls.  We can discuss and debate that but I believe the question is how we adjust either the social health insurance system or taxation system in such a way that the health system can remain stable, deal with crises, provide the appropriate amount of resources, and account for progress and differences between taxation and insurance in some instances.  I have data on this so I invite members to push me on whatever area they wish, as long as I have the answers, of course.<br\/><br\/>Most countries have a mixed system.  The other kind is very rare and the trend is in the opposite direction.  Owing to the impact of social health insurance on labour costs, most countries tend to increase the amount of taxation to compensate or subsidise the insurance system.  All in all, if I were to dare to make a suggestion for the committee's consideration based on international experience, it would be on the fact that a move to social health insurance would not bring additional resources.  There has been a fallacy in other countries that social health insurance will flood the system with resources.  They are not available, basically, and if they are very large, they will end up having an impact on the labour costs.  Second, the administrative cost of transactions may be high so one may need to proceed cautiously if one wants to move to a social health insurance model.  I will be very happy to debate this.<br\/><br\/>On statutory resources, are there any other sources of statutory funds that we can use?  I have a list of what other counties have been doing, particularly in times of crises.  There are some interesting insights from our studies.  All of the studies are available.  We produced one on the impact of the crisis in Ireland, which I hope the committee has seen.  Has the Chairman seen it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I read some of Mr. Figueras's work in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#G00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The study was from 2012.  We were trying to examine some of the options for Ireland in dealing with a shortfall in resources.  I can show some of the slides.<\/p> <p>  One point I will be making throughout my presentation today is that I want members to keep in the back of their minds when they do their work that it does not matter whether the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice.  It is a no-brainer that political values are extremely important in this decision but it is important to separate from other values the values we give politically to the role of the public or private sector, the role of competition and the role of private insurance.  Politically, we may give value to the private sector but the important point is to disentangle the political debate from the technical debate in some instances.<\/p> <p>  One of the more complex issues debated with policy makers when we go on the road is the considerable confusion arising from saying one wants a system because it fits one's values.  Consider the value of choice, for instance.  Choice, even if it does not lead to efficiencies, is valued by populations and member states.  I live in a country called Belgium, where choice has proven to lead to inefficiencies and inequalities, yet it is valued so much by the population that it is maintained in spite of the evidence.  It is appropriate as long as we distinguish between the value debate and the technical debate.  What I am saying is not rocket science; the members know that a million times better than I do but I assure them this is the kind of debate we often face when we work with other member states on these issues.<\/p> <p>  On raising extra funds statutorily, Ireland has some taxes on alcohol and tobacco and is considering a sugar tax and taxes on unhealthy foods.  That is the way to go.  We have an increasing amount of evidence on this and I will be happy to thrash it out in a minute, if members wish.  I am referring to the direction member states are going.  It is a way of having your cake and eating it.  That is not a very good metaphor since I am talking about taxes on unhealthy foods.  The tax does change behaviour.  There is elasticity clearly, particularly with fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola and others.  One may raise additional taxes to further finance the health system.  Of course, the problem is that if this is effective, it kills the source of funding.  I have to hand a picture showing Jamie Oliver very happy about the recent developments.  There are some issues on this subject that I will be very happy to discuss with members if they wish.<\/p><p>Going through my list today, the third area deals with the question should Ireland change its statutory funding?  Should it find additional statutory resources by other means or should it try to shift costs to the private pockets by further increasing the role of private health insurance and out of pocket?  Again I have plenty of data to show what other countries are doing, the pros and cons, the use of charges, the role of private health insurance in other countries, and some of the issues and incentives.  This is a very useful framework that I will use, if the committee wishes to go through it, which tries to ask three questions.  The blue box in the middle cube is what one is providing.<br\/><br\/>So there are three questions.  First, what would be the benefit package?Should we expand it further or reduce it?  What is one producing?  Second, how much of that is one paying in the form of user charges?  Is one paying the whole package or, as is done in Ireland, where there are large charges?  We will talk about that shortly.  They are fairly substantial, not in overall terms but very large in comparative terms, in primary care in Ireland.  I have data on that.  In percentage terms it is around 15% of Ireland's overall expenditure.  It is about the borderline - I will show the committee the data in a committee - where one may endanger financial protection, particularly because it is very much aimed at a particular area, which is primary care and hospital care in spite of the medical cards that may lead some users not to use the services properly because the user charges are quite large.<br\/><br\/>The third question to the committee is should we reduce the universal package and take some of the population out of the coverage.  That is not something that member states are doing.  One thing we have in Europe, the changes have been minimal, is that there is a commitment that makes sense not just in terms of solidarity but in terms of efficiency; there is commitment for universal health coverage.  So there has been very little on the &quot;who&quot; of reducing the universal health coverage.  There is a lot of debate about the user charges - again I will give the committee details on that - and there is debate about the cost of the benefit package.<br\/><br\/>On the benefit package, most of the debate is focused on the issue of before we start rationing perhaps we should do much more work on those areas that are not cost effective.  There are many interventions in Ireland as well as anywhere - I have data on that as well - that are basically not cost-effective.  If one wants to reduce the benefit package one should start in that particular area and there is evidence on that.<br\/><br\/>I would like to summarise this paragraph for the committee.  As members can see I have data here on how Ireland compares with other countries on public and private expenditure.  I hope I do not overwhelm the committee with so much data.  Let me give one thought before we go back to that.  If there is one slide that members would wish to remember today, it would be this one.  I am sure they have seen it before, but I still ask them to consider it for me.  We have to remind ourselves of the 20:80 distribution, the 5:50 or the 10:70.  This tells us that 10% of the population in all countries will use 70% of the resources.That may vary a bit but this is based on many studies - I have data from many countries - and this is an average.  Voluntary health insurance out-of-pocket will not resolve this issue.Ireland has a number of health insurers and a fair amount of regulation.  No health insurer, not even some of the best regulated ones will ever cover the 10% which involves the chronically sick and so on.  Private expenditure of that kind will not resolve the cost-containment issue.  It may play a role if properly designed, but it will not resolve the issue.<br\/><br\/>I ask members to look at the yellow bubble.  One of the problems arises because the insurers are far better than the civil servants in the Department of Health in selecting risks.  Irrespective of the amount of data available, the insurers will always find ways to select risk.  I know Ireland has lifetime community rating, but we all know that with a very large number of packages in Ireland there are multiple ways for the insurers to select risk.  I am not criticising the insurance market.  The insurance market is there to make money in many instances and therefore it is only normal to try to select risk - the incentive is there.  Even with good regulation that is a very difficult issue to address.<br\/><br\/>My fourth question is about rationing.  I am talking so much even in my introduction because I had all these questions in my remit so I am trying to do it in as short a time as possible.  This is another slide I would like the members to remember.  This is very well known data and was published in the <i>BMJ<\/i>in 2009.  More recent data will look exactly the same.  It tells us that out of 2,500 treatments in a hospital today for as much of 50% of them we do not know whether they are effective.  Even scarier is that a number of those, like the green segment here, 8%, plus another 8% referring to trade-off benefits and harms, may be harmful although they may be unclear.  While one may wish to cut the benefit package, it should be done in such a way that we start targeting first.<br\/><br\/>There have been some good developments in Ireland with pharmaceuticals, for instance, not just on price but in looking at those pharmaceuticals that are more cost-effective.  We talked about the funding, a package of care and the use of charges.  What can we do to squeeze more efficiency from providers?  What is the menu there?  The menu that the committee has in its terms of reference as well - we know there is a lot of waste - is in these slides.  I will go through it again very quickly and then I would be happy to go back in detail.<br\/><br\/>There are guidelines on protocols and innovation in ICT.  Ireland has a fair amount of developments in this area, but there is more scope in the sector.  I am aware of Ireland's reforms in the area of payment for performance - around the DRGs, increasing the amount of payment according to activity is clearly the way to go to have a higher percentage of that to adjust for severity.  Clearly we could do more work in the area of pharmaceuticals.<br\/><br\/>I know integrated care is very much part of the committee's terms of reference.  Context specificity is a debate.  The last country I visited, Finland, developed a very interesting pilot on experiences of integrated care.  The committee there was looking for structural top-down reform.  Finland is relevant to Ireland as well.  Like in many other countries, Ireland wants to do things very much bottom-up and build on groups of nurses, social workers and those in community service, who are already working together, and try to strengthen that rather than try to impose new models.  Integrated care has a high variability of models.  What we want is teams working together offering the kinds of framework incentives and structures so that they can work together.  It is good to have some top-down but also to have some bottom-up.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has a lower number of hospital beds.  I know it is in the process of bringing together hospital groups.  I was very impressed by one of the documents I had the opportunity to read.  It was the Department of Health document, Better Health, Improving Health Care.  It goes through these issues very effectively.  I guess it is one of the documents of this committee.<\/p><p>The hospital groups may be a way to create this type of network.  Due to its geographical nature and size, Ireland is not a country in which one wants to provide competition except in Dublin or large cities.  Instead, groups should work together, particularly in cases of horizontal and vertical integration.  There is a fair amount of scope for efficiencies.  Although Ireland's number of beds is relatively small compared with others, there is more scope for horizontal integration and volume outcome.  The volume-outcome relationship is another commandment, to use an almost religious term, in that there is a consensus across the region that we are not treating certain patients at the right level.  That relationship is important.  I do not know the details in Ireland, but I am taking an international perspective.  I do not know whether the volume-outcome relationship is a major problem, but I imagine that it may be an issue.<\/p><p> Another area of interest for Ireland is that of skills mix optimisation.  I will cite numbers in a moment.  Ireland has more nurses than doctors, which is the international trend.  Ireland has considerable potential to get more nurses and similar professionals into the skills mix, given the shortage of doctors.  The observatory is undertaking a major study of different skills mixes.  There is plenty of evidence that nurses are better than doctors - I should be cautious, as I do not know whether the rules of the committee allow me to say this - at chronic care and prevention because they spend more time with and are more empathetic towards patients.  I am a medical doctor as well as an economist, so I am not against the medical profession at all, but there are many ways in which we can use nurse practitioners.  Ireland is in the process of implementing, and could step up in this regard, the concept of primary care teams, PCTs.  The role of nursing and similar professions is important, in particular as we move to community care.  We could discuss this matter in a minute.<\/p><p> Interestingly, I got recently updated data on 2014 for the committee.  These data show Ireland's peculiar situation.  They take a bit of time to understand.  The middle is the average of the EU 28, with two axes.  The vertical is the number of nurses.  This is in comparative terms and I am not saying whether it is good or bad.  I am careful about averages.  There is a sense that, if one is average, one is fine, but that is not true.  At the top are countries with a high number of nurses.  I believe that the green is Norway, but I cannot remember.  Ireland has a higher than average number.  To the right on the horizontal access is a high number of doctors.  I hope that I am not making a mess of this.  In the upper left quadrant is Ireland, which has a high number of nurses and a low number of doctors.  What does the spread of countries tell us?  Is it not an interesting presentation?  It tells us that there must be a great deal of uncertainty if there is such a variation between member states in the most basic mix in health care, namely, between doctors and nurses.  Imagine what the case is in respect of specialists, surgeons and other professionals.  We do not know what the right mix might be.<\/p><p> Next are recent data from my colleagues.  The observatory has done a great deal of work on migration and these data are based on the OECD's figures.  It does not mention that in my presentation, so I apologise.  My colleague, Dr. Irene Glinos, put these data together.  They show that Ireland relies heavily on foreign doctors, accounting for as much as a third.  The committee will better understand the situation of doctors coming from other countries than me.  In spite of this path dependency, Ireland is the only country in Europe - I will dare to speak strongly on this point, with the Chairman's permission - that does not have universal coverage in primary health care.  Primary health care is free to access in every country in the EU regardless of income or economic strength.  I know about Ireland's path dependency, the significant positive strides and recent changes that have been made to cover people aged under six years or over 70 years of age with medical cards and the importance of equity in access, but universal coverage in primary health care is a principle elsewhere.  Time and again, reforms have told us that primary health care provides value for money when it works well.  As with any study that is shown to the committee, this one presents problems, but it tries to highlight variations in the strength of primary health care.  In Ireland, primary health care does not look good.  Ireland is in the red based on this.<\/p><p> I am cautious, cautious and cautious - I say this three times - about data and benchmarks of these kinds.  I am presenting these to provoke debate in the committee.  <\/p><p>For instance, these are the data on which we based our work.  Kringos et al worked with us as well.  We have been using that study, which examined issues of structure, accessibility, continuity of care, co-ordination and comprehensiveness.  These numbers are indicators.  Actually, there is another slide.  I am sorry, and I hope that I am not confusing the committee by showing so many slides.  This one may be easier to understand.  It shows the structure of primary care and the delivery process.  For Ireland, it is weak, weak, strong, weak, strong, weak and medium.  Service delivery is on the right hand side of the slide.  Access is weak, continuity of primary care is strong, co-ordination is weak and comprehensiveness is medium.  All in all, it counts as weak.  We can discuss this study, as it is worth consideration.<\/p><p> I will make my next comment with a great deal of caution.  Ireland has experts from whom I learn.  I am just drawing from others and the international comparisons.  Dr. Sara Burke appeared before the committee recently.  She, Dr. Steve Thomas and Professor Charles Normand have done much important research and know far more than I do but, based on this research and others, user charges plus alleged access issues may explain Ireland's hospital-focused system and its difficulties in returning people to primary and community care.  The committee may wish to consider this matter further.  Here are more data in that regard.<\/p><p> In discussing primary health care, this is a good indicator.  These are OECD data on hospital admission rates for patients who should not be in hospital because they would be better treated elsewhere.  That they are in hospital may mean that primary care is not as effective as we wish.  Look at Ireland in the spider's web on this slide.  In terms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, Ireland has one of the highest admission rates in Europe.  Why would so many patients be admitted to and treated in hospital for this?  I must be cautious, as there may be many reasons.  For example, it may be an incentive for some because they do not need to pay user charges or they may not be taken care of in general practice.  I do not know the exact data, but the committee must examine the issue.<\/p><p> Other issues are also worth considering.  For instance, the blue represents diabetes.  Ireland is around average, although it could do better.  Green is asthma and over there is CHF.  Is that chronic health failure or cardiac heart failure?  It is chronic heart failure.  I am sorry.  Sometimes, the chronics confuse me as well.  Ireland is doing well in this regard and the figure shows that it is better controlled.  I know what members are thinking, namely, that this does not quite make sense.<\/p><p>It is not a coherent picture.  There are some indicators that may explain why primary care is not as effective as it could be, as well as data on the quality of hospitals and so on.  Ultimately, we must work on health determinants and policies.<\/p><p> I am fascinated by the factors behind the decline in coronary heart disease.  A comparative study into the decline in coronary heart disease looked at treatments, risk factors or unexplained factors.  The results are very interesting, depending on where one carries out the study.  In Finland, for example, 76% of the decline was attributed to addressing the risk factors and 24% to treatment.  In the United States, 47% is explained by improvements in treatment and 44% by addressing risk factors.  I must remind the committee that risk factors play a very important role in decreasing coronary heart disease.  That is obvious.  Ireland has a very good policy in this area, Healthy Ireland.  It is worthwhile supporting and continuing to push this new policy.  The work on obesity, alcohol, tobacco and so on is very important.  Obesity is one of the major issues facing this country.  It will have an impact on sustainability.<\/p><p> If committee members have time and cannot sleep some night, they could look at the OECD and WHO research data.  It is actually very good but it is deep.  It systematically goes through the various interventions that yield value for money by looking at determinants.  There is lots of data there which shows value for money is related to determinants.  In terms of various policies in Europe, Ireland, with its new policy, is very much in line.<\/p><p> I will move on to sectoral governance covered in my last slide - I know I keep saying that but the terms of reference the committee gave me were very broad.  One of the complexities that we see in reforms elsewhere is in implementation.  It is a question of how one aligns incentives.  It is fairly easy to look at this area by area and say that is what we should do.  The really difficult thing is how to phase it in.  How do we make sure that the incentives do not push us in opposite directions?  We may want to rationalise hospital care but then private health insurance provides a number of incentives not to do so.  We may want to have open access but then introduce a reform that goes against this.  One of the elements is the alignment of incentives or reforms and then staging or phasing them in, particularly in the context of fairly complex structural reforms.  The ability to stage them, to go to the low-hanging fruit, not to burn out the system or run out of capacity to implement the reforms is crucial.  Many of the reforms are very complex to implement.<\/p><p> I presented a paper to the Council of Ministers of the European Union recently and I hope to be able to explain that here.  One of the things we learned about reforms was the impact of the financial crisis.  The apple tree diagram was developed by Dr. Bengoa and myself and it deals with the kinds of reforms that can be done.  When there is political pressure, as was the case in Ireland and many other countries, one must go for the low-hanging fruit.  A word of caution - I mean low-hanging fruit in two senses.  First, starting the reforms in areas that are cost-effective, easy to do and with which one will get results.  Second, low hanging fruit can also refer to situations where the Minister for Finance, as happened here, knocks on the door and says \"I need a 5% cut\".  What has happened in many countries in Europe is that they have gone for the low-hanging fruit because of the pressure.  Some of these reforms were good, including price control on pharmaceuticals which Ireland did.  This was excellent because Ireland was one of the highest spenders on pharmaceuticals.  Ireland's negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies and its work on generics and so on has been very much in the right direction.  However, in other areas, it was not so good.  Cuts to training and research, increasing use of charges, staff cuts, population exclusions, rationing benefits and so forth may save money very quickly but may not necessarily give the system sustainability in the long run.  What has happened in many of the member states is that the high apples that are difficult to do, many of which will not show savings very quickly, have been left.  Let us take integrated care as an example.  We did some research recently which shows that integrated care increases the cost effectiveness of the system but will not yield short-term savings.  With integrated care, you treat patients better, which is the way to go.  However, cost effectiveness is not equal to savings.  These are the complex areas that do not yield immediate savings but which increase cost effectiveness.  If we concentrate on those, we may have less energy to undertake the complex, structural reform implementation.  Some of what needs to be done in Ireland is rather complex.  It is important to focus on it, stage it, look at the alignment and so on.<\/p><p> I will make a few concluding remarks and then we can go into detail on any aspects of my presentation about which members have questions.  In terms of implementation, caution must be taken with structural reform.  I know structural reform is necessary but caution is needed.  It is important always to remember context and part dependency.  Marginal reforms might be more effective.  It may be better to strengthen the current system rather than embark on major structural reform of insurance, for example.  I spoke about alignment and the importance of the process and pace of implementation.  Ireland and many countries in the region have a lot of uncertainty in their models.  We do not have evidence on what is the best way to integrate services or to pay doctors and nurses, for example.  I was working on a reform of the French system involving payment for performance, for example.  We have some evidence on this but we do not know how actors will react.  Bob Evans used to say that the only way to pay doctors is to change it every year so that they do not have time to adapt; you keep confusing them and moving them around.  He suggested that the answer was to move them all of the time.  That sounds cynical and I hope the committee does not mind me making such a joke.  This is not a good way to pay doctors or nurses.<\/p><p> Technical capacity is important.  I am particularly impressed with the ability and capacity of researchers and the Department of Health in this country.  I had the opportunity to work with them in a number of areas.  There is a lot to be done but if one tries to do it all at the same time, it will not work.  Flexibility and bottom up reform are also important.  If it is necessary to pass legislation, I would recommend using framework legislation that allows flexibility.  I wish, if I may dare, to make a suggestion to the committee.  This committee is extremely important but if it is very normative, with a big blueprint, it may find that it cannot predict what will happen in the next five years.  It is impossible to predict how things will work out.  I apologise for being so direct.  I have seen similar committees.  I wish to congratulate members for this initiative but if the committee tries, in the context of such a complex area, to devise a detailed blueprint, it may prove very difficult to implement.<\/p><p> The issue for this committee and similar ones in other countries is to devise a good framework, with guiding principles and a consensus on the fundamentals but to allow flexibility so that the reforms do not end up working in different directions.  In terms of the low hanging fruit, political resources for change are always limited, even if this is a consensus committee.  Human resources in particular, are always limited.  It is important, as I said before, to concentrate on those areas that are easy to implement and about which there is consensus.<\/p><p> Finally, as policy makers, members of this committee know already that communication is the essence of everything.  How one communicates with the medical profession is very important.  It is very clear what the medical profession in this country, and elsewhere in Europe, wants.  It is essential to have all of the medical professions on board.  Attention must also be paid to communication with the press and the public.  I know this is all very obvious.  I would just point out, without mentioning any names, that I was presented with five business cases for reforms recently.  They were excellent reforms but they were totally misrepresented by vested interests and they failed, even though they were technically excellent and necessary.<\/p><p> I apologise for taking so long, even though I was attempting to give the committee an abridged version of my presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Figueras.

It is much more complex to talk about the technologies or the treatments of certain cancers or diseases where there is more uncertainty as to where they should be rolled out.  In primary health care, it is fairly straightforward, starting with health promotion.  I should have said health prevention.  Health promotion is important also, but it is partially outside the health care system in terms of health.  Clearly, it plays a fundamental role in secondary prevention, and primary prevention to some extent, in terms of screening purposes and areas on which there is consensus such as screening for a number of cancers.  Colon cancer is a very good example, but there are many others such as diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol on which the guidelines are very straight.  There is no uncertainty as to what is cost effective and what works.<\/p> <p>  At the margins, we could debate certain screening.  We could go into prostate cancer, for instance, which is an area that is not recommended, but there is plenty of evidence in that area as to the kinds of secondary and tertiary prevention interventions we can do in primary health care.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the shape of the system, the remaining benefits are from first contact care.  I would strengthen the ability of general practitioners and primary care teams to do some diagnostics.  There is much more that can be done at that level.  The control of chronic diseases should be at that level for most of those, unless there are major complications.  We do not want diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and many other diseases, including asthma and so on, controlled elsewhere.  From what I have read, and I apologise if I make a mistake as I do not know the Irish system perfectly well, that is very much the direction in which Ireland is going.  I would very much suggest that Ireland move in that direction.  I repeat that secondary prevention, control of chronic disease, and being able to address the first contact care issue are important.  It is being able to make the first diagnosis or to refer quickly someone with an acute disease who comes through the door.  Continuing the gate-keeping is the way to go, although the gate-keeping here is very soft.  By that I mean, they are wise to bypass that.  There is a huge problem in the accident and emergency services, which I believe is partially because the middle classes have to pay &euro;55 to see a GP.  I probably should not say this but I can understand the incentive for the middle classes to go directly to hospital if they have to pay &euro;55 to see their GP.

There is a huge variation as to how those community rehabilitation types of health services are provided.  With regard to physiotherapy, for instance, some countries provide a number of sessions, depending on the disease, paid by the system.  Following that there would be a user charge or the patient would need another inspectorate or GP to refer them.

My next question is a bit of a novel question.  In the D&aacute;il last night we spoke about cigarettes and the fact that 50 cent has been put on a packet of 20 cigarettes in the budget.  They now retail at &euro;11.  My sister died seven weeks ago from lung cancer.  She was 35 years of age.  She was a smoker but they said it was nothing to do with smoking.  The reason I say this is that she had a stroke before she died and when she was in the acute stroke unit in St. James's Hospital, there were many stroke patients there who were a lot older than my sister Edwina and who were going outside to smoke even though they had just had a stroke.  The staff were losing their senses over this.  They were angry and upset that people who had had a stroke were still continuing to smoke.  I phrase my question in the context of knowing people who smoke.  It is not that I want them penalised but when one looks at insurance companies, for example, a person will have a more favourable policy if he or she is a non-smoker.  Does it happen in other jurisdictions that non-smokers are prioritised in regard to health care or in some other way?  My question comes from the premise of trying to help people and to incentivise them to give up smoking.  Does Dr. Figueras believe this is something that could happen in this State and does it happen in any other country?

These are really good questions.  I thank the Deputies who have got to the heart of the issues.  I very much enjoy having the opportunity to thrash out these issues.  I will try to structure my replies around my presentation and I hope I will not forget any points that have been raised.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the Chairman's questions about the benefit package.  Some of the questions raised had to do with that query, particularly the issue of the 10% of the population and the insurance, the benefit packages and whether we should prioritise against those people engaging in harmful behavioural practices, such as smoking, etc.  There are some examples that I will share with the committee.  I will take the last question first because I would hate to forget that one and not to respond to it properly.  I must be cautious.  What I am saying is that one of the most difficult concepts to explain to finance Ministers is the difference between cost effectiveness and savings.  One can be cost effective and not have savings, one can have savings and not be cost effective and one can be cost effective and have savings.  In addition to Ireland, I have been in many other countries hit by financial crises, which I will not mention, and I have worn my more academic hat and talked about their options.  The finance Ministers would say, \"Yes, Josep, fine, but my new budget is in January and where do I get the money out of that?\".  It is true that for integrated care, one sets it - for many of these areas, one has to invest first.  Even when rationalising hospitals or when closing hospitals, which in theory gives savings, in the first two years, it generates lay-offs, packages which must be provided and the integration of services.  I do not want to sound superficial when discussing closing a hospital but one of the biggest complexities when merging hospitals is who is going to be the head of each department of the merged entity.  That may sound funny but it is actually an example of the political complexities - political with a small \"p\" - which create a lot of inefficiencies and create the noise that reduces efficiency.  In the long-run, rationalising hospitals will share the savings.  Integrated care may share the savings but the other issue there is that the savings for integrated care do not accrue to those who put in the money.  All this money is put into community care but who benefits from that?  It is the hospitals because they will have fewer admissions.  The Deputies may be aware of a basic principle in health care - bed empty, bed filled.  One may end up being very cost effective in community care because patients are being treated in a more integrated way but the savings will not be seen as they will go elsewhere, or the savings will be used by other patients.  Yes, one has to invest in many of these areas, and I am very glad to see the numbers in regard to Ireland's economy are getting better, and now Ireland has the possibility to do this restructuring and focus on the high tree.  The level of the tree will allow it to shed the mid-term to long-term benefits and cost effectiveness.<\/p> <p>  The second point, which is very important, is that it is true that finance Ministers sometimes do not understand the difference between cost effectiveness and savings, but when they do they are not as worried.  I have encountered some people, whose names I cannot say in a public committee, who in discussions with their finance Ministry have said that the curve has to flatten and they cannot spend more than that, but they are mostly concerned about being a black box - they want to be reassured that if money is being spent, then it is cost effective and makes a difference.  They are very worried about all this money.  We tell them it goes into health services, it is very important and very useful and that health is wealth.  Yes, I have plenty of data on the subject of health is wealth but one has to demonstrate it.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has asked that I speak about the benefit package.  I will address this question.  If I am not mistaken, many of the other questions are around delivery of promotions, skill mix and so forth.  I will turn now to the package of care, prioritisation and the issue of the 10% of population, which is circumvented by insurers.  If the committee will allow me, I will be a bit more structured.  Do we have ten minutes for that?  How in depth would the Chairman like me to go?

The typical figure, which I believe the Deputies have seen many times, shows the percentage of statutory funding - in this case it is coming from general government taxation - is 67% in this particular data.  This data is for 2012, but it has not changed that much.  I was looking through newer data - my research fellow did not send me the data from 2015 - but it is not that different now.  The figure of 67% in relative terms is under the OECD figure.  I apologise if I am confusing the committee.  For some figures, I am using the relevant numbers from OECD data while for others, I am using the EU 28 data for 2017.<\/p><p> There are two interesting aspects of the situation in Ireland.  One is that its level of funding from private health insurance is one of the highest in the OECD, at 12%.  France has a very different funding model but Germany is at only 10%.  Slovenia is interesting, and one to look at if Ireland wants to reform its private health insurance.  We did an evaluation of Slovenia's reform and studied the role of private health insurance.  The United States is not relevant for Ireland so I will not discuss its system.  <\/p><p> I am not against, or in favour of, private health insurance but I ask members to read the book about it I have brought along to the meeting  It is a very recent book and I can send electronic copies to members if they wish.  No country has managed to use private health insurance appropriately and it is terribly difficult to do so.  The companies select their markets and always work in the most profitable areas so they will not resolve sustainability issues.  I do not say they do not play a role and they are often highly valued by the population.  In one country, three Ministers lost their jobs trying to reform private health insurance.  The population believed private health insurance was so important that it was a no-go area.<\/p><p> If a country has private health insurance it should make sure it is not subsidised by the public sector, though I am not talking about Ireland in this case.  If private health insurers cover 10% of the total market they should pay the full cost to the hospitals, they should not benefit from special subsidies or prices or gain equity benefits from bypassing queues.<\/p><p> There are two issues.  One is the issue of efficiency and the other is equity.  In countries like Ireland, which have supplementary insurance enabling people to bypass the queues, there is a negative impact on equity.  According to data I have, Ireland has among the largest supplementary insurance coverage in Europe.  There is also an efficiency argument too, because if the funding is there one will want it to be used for a cost-effective package of services.  An economist once said that financing the health service is taking something from one pocket and putting it back into the same pocket.  It is a fallacy to say that private health insurance does not affect the treasury.  I pay for it as a citizen, so why do we not have the same rigour for private health insurance as we have for general taxation?  I pay my money to an intermediary, namely, the State to the social health insurer or the private health insurer.  There is a consumer, an intermediary and a provider - that is what the economics of health care are.  People want the citizen not to pay too much and the system to be as progressive as possible.  They also want the intermediary to use the money and to get good results from the provider.  Private health insurers have not been shown to be more cost-effective and they have higher administrative costs.  They select markets, are more expensively administratively and tend to be less cost-effective when it comes to purchasing, as these studies show, and it is a fallacy to say otherwise.<\/p><p> I will summarise the general findings on health insurance from the book.  There are concerns about financial protection for equity.  One has to take account of the fact that tax discounts for private health insurance amount to paying them with public money.  There are efficiency concerns and there is no evidence of superior efficiency in purchasing.  This is the broader perspective on the 10% question.  There have been many debates about this but it has not proved possible in any country to have a lot of competition in the private insurance sector for the 10% to whom Deputy O'Connell referred.  The 10% in question are chronic diabetics and chronic patients in general.  For the 10% one would need to have integration of services and a chain of services.  One would want to pay providers by bundled payments.  The mechanisms of private health insurance include shopping around and market competition but if one wanted to introduce market competition one should start with areas where there is a clear product to measure, such as surgery, where one can readily measure the quality and the cost.  No private insurer is going to take the very expensive patients.  We have information about what such patients spend and it is practically impossible to create premiums for them.  The young will never join such schemes because there is no incentive to join a scheme where one has to pay for those patients.  Am I answering the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Yes, but there was another question on how the doctor and the nurse related to outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#N00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>There was also a question about the benefit package and the priorities in that regard.  I do not know whether Ireland has an <i>Haute Autorit&eacute; de Sant&eacute;<\/i>or some other such organisation but it is worth having more support in identifying the 50%.  There is enough evidence about what is cost-effective and in the pharmaceutical area a number of treatments are not cost-effective.  The same is true of many diagnostic treatments in hospitals, which are very well known but which I will go not go through.  If we have to reduce the benefit package let us start by identifying those interventions.  It is important to separate what is cost-effective for some patients from what is cost-effective for others.  Often a new drug, a me-too drug which is a copy of a previous drug, emerges.  The pharmaceutical companies will say the drug is very good and more cost-effective for certain types of patient.  One such drug is for blood pressure, which is good for malignant hypertension and cost-effective for the group which has it.  If it is put it on the market there will be pressure from companies on GPs to prescribe the more expensive drug rather than diuretics, which are good value for money.  One of the most cost-effective interventions for strokes is measuring the blood pressure of everybody and making them urinate.  I am sorry to be so graphic but primary care can save lots of money in this way because strokes are one of the main causes of expenditure, involving huge rehabilitation costs and outlay on drug units.<\/p><p>What I am getting at is an issue about what is cost-effective and for which patient is it cost-effective.  There is plenty of evidence out there to identify the 49%.  Here, another suggestion is to work with the medical profession.  They know that.  One needs to develop guidelines with them to identify these interventions.<\/p><p> The second question was about Deputy Madigan's family loss.  I am sorry, it is horrible to face that in one's family at such a young age.  As to whether this benefit package issue relates to that, this is an area where we did some work with the Netherlands, a member of the observatory, which wanted to see whether they should adjust premiums for risk behaviour for obesity, tobacco, etc.  Taking a clear case, hepatitis and the treatment of hepatitis, if someone gets re-infected, should one provide that or not?  Here it is a value issue that the committee needs to address.  A school of thought that I personally would identify with - it is my personal belief it is about ethics and values - states that we are determined by our environment, social class and family when we make these decisions.  Could one blame me because I decide to eat more or could one blame me for risk behaviour?  Is it my decision or is it because my social economic decision is such because I have been unemployed, etc?  I tend to be less victim-blaming and accept that someone will smoke, and even if he or she smokes, I will provide treatment.  I suppose I would not facilitate a second transplant or whatever in these cases, but I am wary of victim-blaming.  My values would be not to adjust premiums according to risk behaviour.<\/p><p> Having said that, there are some marginal adjustments made in this regard.  Elsewhere, it occurs.  One has that in the private sector all the time.  Private health insurance is always adjusted according to risk.  In the public sector in Europe, interestingly, there are only examples in the area of dental care.  In Germany, if one goes to the hygienist for one's preventable visits, one would not have to pay for a filling afterwards if one has a problem with caries; if not, one must pay for it.  The Dutch wanted to do that with more harsh incentives but they decided against it because of the equity impact.  I do know whether I answered.  Is that the point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Yes, that is perfect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#O00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Let me move now to the workforce issues, the framework legislation and the cigarettes issues.

Yes, I am sorry.<\/p> <p>  Linked to that, let us go quickly to the skill mix.  We do not know the outcome based on that.  The same is so with the question about the beds.  It is frustrating.  When I started in my career, I got a scholarship.  I come from Spain.  I got my first scholarship from the regional government when I was in my mid-20s to study in the UK and they said that they would pay for my scholarship but I would have to come back and tell them how many beds they needed.  They said that in the UK, they know everything and I would have to tell them that.  It sounds silly, and I thought I could find out.  It took years to understand there is no such thing as the right number of beds or the right skill mix, but there are principles.<\/p> <p>  It is not about the number of beds; it is about how to use them.  It is not about the beds.  The number of beds will depend on how primary health care is working.  It will depend on day-care surgery.  I must say I look at some of Ireland's numbers and if I am not mistaken, there has been a significant increase in the use of day-care surgery.  That is worthy of congratulations.  A lot has to do with the way one pays.  The committee has not asked me that but let me say it anyway.  If one pays in a way where there is a greater incentive for day-care surgery and if one pays in a way where there is greater incentive for primary care, one can resolve some of one's problems at hospitals level.<\/p> <p>  As for the number of beds, I have data here.  It is not in one of the slides - my fellow forgot to put it there.  However, I can say it by heart and if the committee gives me a minute, I can find the slide on my computer.  I agree that Ireland has one of the lowest number among countries in Europe.  In the UK, for instance, England's is lower.  That does not mean they are far worse in their use of beds.  It is really the way one uses these beds, turnover and continuity of care.  The problem of Ireland's waiting times is not the number of beds, I would say.  It is much more how one uses them, how patients can be discharged into community care, how one pays for that, how one further uses day-care surgery, how efficient one is and how one networks these hospitals rather than, necessarily, the number of beds.  I agree Ireland's number is low in comparative terms but I would not say that is necessarily the problem, although I do not know the country well enough.  I have not had the opportunity to look at it recently.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the skill mix between doctors and nurses, it all depends how one uses the doctors and nurses.  One can have lots of nurses and fewer doctors, and say: \"You see, I am more cost-effective.\"  If one uses the nurses to do certain jobs, one is not that cost-effective.  With more doctors, it depends on how one uses the doctors.  In some countries in Europe, there are paediatricians who weigh children as they operate alone.  That is not cost-effective.  That is wasting resources.  I do not have this data.  No one has it.  We know that if one looks on the nurses and doctors as the basic level, there is much more that one can do.  When one looks at nurses, it is fascinating that one says the problem is doctors do not accept nurses in the jobs of doctors.  One of the problems when we suggest a skill mix is the politics of doctors accepting nurses in new roles but what is interesting is that when nurses acquire these new roles, the nurses do not accept nurses to take some of the roles.  One of the issues of skill mix is the political debate and how one brings the profession to understand it is not a threat to them, but rather a way to make the cost effective.  Surely that paediatrician prefers to see children rather than weighing them, but the paediatrician is worried about his or her income.  One should find a way to pay him or her appropriately.  Whatever is appropriate is not a debate - the committee will be aware that Ireland, according to OECD data, has the highest paid doctors in Europe.  I note there is much debate about whether the numbers are fine or not, but that is what the OECD says.  Maybe the committee will invite the OECD.  I will tell the committee where the numbers came from.  I do not have the details of whether that skill mix has better outcomes or not, but certainty a better skill mix with nurses doing more jobs that belong now to doctors is bound to increase cost-effectiveness and quality of the system.<\/p> <p>  I am getting there.  I am really sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>There was an important question asked about legislation and working with a framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#O00600","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>What do I mean by framework legislation?

One of the most useful factors when I talk with countries on reforms is to have a lawyer in the room because what we have learned is one can do an awful lot within current legislation.  Sometimes the cost in parliament to pass legislation is so high that one can do an awful lot using current legislation.

There was 67% or 68% in government funding, with private out-of-pocket spending at 21% in Spain and 20% in Ireland.  They were very similar but Spain seems to have one of the best primary care systems across the OECD.  Why is that?<\/p> <p>  The witness mentioned the raising of extra statutory revenue from taxes on fizzy drinks or fatty foods.  We spoke about legislation a while ago.  If we were to legislate for that, would it be a good idea to ring-fence the funding and put it directly into the health system?  We speak to people at the doors and they do not mind spending money if they get a proper service for it.  I had many more issues to raise but the witness covered most of them in responding to previous speakers.

I am not sure I would agree that they are among the highest paid but that is neither here nor there.<\/p> <p>  With the system of integrated waiting lists, we have a difficulty in particular in this country as we do not have a unique patient identifier.  There are many people waiting for health services on multiple waiting lists.  They may be on a waiting list for area A when the procedure could be performed more quickly in area B.  We do not have a linked system and I am interested to hear Dr. Figueras's views on the extent to which the integrated waiting list system has worked in Portugal.  I believe it has one of the best examples.  There is also the necessity to invest in information and communications technology to support that system.<\/p> <p>  We keep coming back to primary care teams and I hope we are shifting, albeit very painfully and slowly, into a model that is more focused on primary care.  The witness touched on the need for fully resourced teams and perhaps there should be a system taking in physiotherapists, for example.  Is there is a gold standard or model we should aspire to in terms of staffing and skill mix for a functioning primary care team?  Is there any data on the best ratio of patients to members of staff on a primary care team?  Is there a case for deprivation weighting, meaning there would be more staff and resources, depending on the socio-economic make-up of the community that is being served.<\/p> <p>  I am not a nurse but I spent many years representing nurses.  We have a serious issue with the skills that our nurses have, as they are very often wasted.  We have health care assistants trained to qualification level five who could take on the work.  It is a little bit like changing from driving on the left to driving on the right.  One cannot do it incrementally and one must go for a big bang on it.  I am just wondering if we could look at a model in this regard.  I appreciate that nowhere gets the skill mix right.  Is there somewhere that does it better than here?  Currently, I know we have skilled nurses who are not using their skills to the best of their potential and doctors not doing the work they could and should be doing.  Health care assistants are willing to take on some of the duties of nurses.  It is a question of how we can shift that up.  Is there a model we can look at?

I beg the forgiveness of colleagues.  I am a medical doctor as well and I was not trying to bully doctors whatever.  I hope the members understand that.  I am a medical doctor and when I speak of primary care in Ireland, I know there is much goodwill and strong work in the professions to improve the system.  It is about dependency.  The system started with a model of medical cards and the hope that everybody would have one but nobody would need it.  The professions have tried very hard to provide that kind of universal coverage.  In no way do I look to undermine them.  One of the areas I have been reading about and which I believe is true relates to the quality of the staff.  This includes nursing and medical staff in Ireland.  It is very high and one of the positive sides of the system.  It is more about organisational issues and so on.<\/p> <p>  The data is there on payments and I cannot ignore it.  Whether that reflects reality, I really do not know.  One can take it with a pinch of salt.  It is worth looking at.  Reforms in Ireland do not necessarily mean the professionals should get less money.  We should aim to keep the same income and ask professionals to work in a system or with terms of reference that can meet needs better.  They work together in correlated teams.  It is not about cutting salaries or incomes but rather it is about how to get more value for money by giving a professional the opportunity to do the kind of work he or she probably wants to do.  I am not calling for a cut in salaries today.  I am not calling for anything but merely reflecting on the issues.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on the system in Spain.  One should take into account that the information hides many differences.<\/p><p>I am Spanish - Catalan actually if I can be controversial - and as one can see, out-of-pocket payments account for 21% of expenditure in Spain against 18% here.  However, it should be noted that in Spain direct payments to private providers are not user charges, while in Ireland, if I am not mistaken, formal statutory user charges account for a fair amount of these direct payments.  While the Spanish health service is not a great system - there is no such thing as a great system in Europe as all health systems are struggling to do better - the high percentage of out-of-pocket payments in Spain is explained by problems of access and waiting lists.  This means people go directly to a private doctor and pay out of pocket for a service.  The reasons for the high percentage of out-of-pocket payment are not confined to waiting lists, however, because preferences are sometimes a feature.  Some people want to have a private doctor and because they can afford to pay the cost, they will decide to pay a doctor directly.  Those factors explain the difference in respect of out-of-pocket payments. <\/p><p> I was asked the reason primary care is stronger in Spain and I do not wish to be too negative about primary care in Ireland, which is low in the ranking.  There have been many studies carried out on this issue and one must be cautious in interpreting their findings.  Primary care in Spain appears to work well and to be strong because there is good access and doctors are very trained.  Believe it or not, I used to work as a general practitioner in Spain before moving to public health policy and economics.  As is the case in Ireland, general practitioners in Spain have been trained as family doctors working on prevention as well as cure.  We have been taught since we were babies, so to speak, that nurses and doctors are equal, which means doctors work as equal professionals with nurses, physiotherapists and social workers.  From day 1, general practitioners will work in primary care centres with teams, which helps a great deal.  Money does not explain the reason Spain does better in this area.  It is the way in which this money is spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Is staffing also an issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#Q00200","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>It is the mix of staffing.  Nurses play a very important role, for example, they do some prescribing.  In my case, which was 20 years ago, I would share the prescribing duties with my nurse, although the practice is not totally approved.  At that point, one had to be very cautious about legal issues.  However, for chronic care and so on, this approach worked very well.  Nurses also do prevention tasks, some screening tasks and so forth.  There is also a good integration of services with the hospital level and so on.  These are some of the reasons for the findings on primary care in Spain.<\/p> <p>  Another feature of the Spanish system is that Spain has adopted soft purchasing as opposed to hard purchasing, the approach taken in Britain which provides hard incentives and encourages provider competition.  While strategic purchasing takes place in Spain, the country is associated with soft purchasing, agreements, contracts and transparency.  I am reminded of the question on transparency and where the money goes.  In any case, this approach could explain the strong good will shown towards public health. <\/p> <p>  Spain has a long coastline and grows large amounts of vegetables and fruit, which also helps.

I remember a Minister, whose name I will not mention, who once told me over dinner that he managed the treasury and increased taxes but he could not get any of the additional revenue.  He had been very successful but all the extra taxes were used to finance the deficit and none of the revenue went into health care.  I totally agree with the Deputy who put it very nicely in stating that the population is happy and accepts it when extra taxes are earmarked for health care.  This is a very good idea and a palatable and acceptable approach.  However, as I stated, if one is successful, the Minister for Finance will ask why one wants more funding.  If one is successful, achieves high elasticity and people have stopped smoking, one may jeopardise funding.  One has to be cautious in this regard.<\/p> <p>  One must also be careful about what are known as sinful taxes.  We learned a great deal about the \"fat\" taxes introduced in Denmark.  If members wish, I could spend five minutes explaining the position.  One must target these taxes very well and be cautious about harmful alternatives.  If, for example, people switch to sugar when fat is taxed, what is the point of a fat tax?  Second, there is no point introducing taxes on sugar if one does not subsidise healthy food, which we know is expensive.  The issue, therefore, is how one tailors measures to make a difference.  It is not just about the treasury introducing a 10 cent tax on Coca Cola or Fanta.  I apologise for using brand names, although it will not make a difference as Coca Cola does not like me in any case.  I am referring to fizzy drinks in general.  <\/p> <p>  We know that Ireland faces serious challenges with childhood obesity.  Malta has a similar problem.  We need to deal with vending machines and fizzy drinks because they are not okay.  If members wish to prioritise, as parliamentarians and politicians, they should be strong and act on these issues, advertising and so forth.  That would be value for money.  As I stated, I have a large volume of material on this issue and I will send a copy to the committee.  The figures on how much can be achieved through these types of interventions are impressive. <\/p> <p>  If one earmarks funding, one may get into trouble but it is more palatable and acceptable.  All in all, I would choose to earmark taxes as much as possible. <\/p> <p>  I was asked a question on payment for performance.  We are working with the French social insurance system.  In principle, payment for performance is the way to go because one wants to pay according to outcome.  However, it is terribly difficult to achieve.  Ireland could do a little bit more in this area.  I can relate this to deprivation payments in primary care.  I believe Ireland has scope to adjust the capitation a little bit better in relation to age, some diseases and deprivation.  I will return to the issue of chronic diseases but I totally agree with the view expressed on deprivation.  Clearly, one wants doctors to work in certain poorer areas and geographical areas with greater deprivation.  I am also in favour of adjusting payments as much as possible to risk or outcomes. <\/p> <p>  Economists, of which I am one, love this idea.  One has this wonderful formula of paying for outcomes but it just does not work that way.  One must be very cautious.  While increasing the percentage of payment by outcomes is a great idea, there is a ceiling.  We are examining this issue for the third time in France and we have realised the importance of having transparency for the profession and providers.  We want them to know we are paying attention and we will tell them we will link payment to performance but one should not go beyond a figure of 10% or 15%.  Payment should be adjusted for risks and one should also pay some adjusted capitation for services and outcomes.  However, this should not be done on a case-by-case basis because we do not have enough good data to say what are good outcomes and to measure and pay by outcomes. <\/p> <p>  Professor Allyson Pollock probably spoke about payment by outcomes in the United Kingdom.  The UK decided to pay by outcomes and succeeded in doing so but this resulted in significant inflationary pressure.  What does one do when this happens?  If one wants to pay by outcomes, the way to go about it is to shift the target.  This means one does not say what one will do from one year to the next and one can change outcomes in different years.  Hopefully, if one stops paying for outcome A in one year and starts paying for outcome B, the service providers will still work well in achieving outcome A.  If not, one would be missing the point by not hitting the target because the provider would do very well in respect of the outcomes for which payment is being made but would do well in respect of other outcomes.  One cannot pay for every single outcome.  This issue is very nuanced.<\/p> <p>  Another advantage of paying by performance is that it involves transparency and allows data to be collected.  By virtue of observing professionals, they become more cautious and work better.  That is my view of the issue expressed in a simplistic way. <\/p> <p>  I was asked a question on the 49% figure.  I will show another figure on the United States which is as interesting as the 49% figure.  Unfortunately for us, I have more data on this.  This is the wrong way to look at this issue.  It is taken from a study carried out by a very influential Institute of Medicine in 2012, which tells us how much waste is in the system and tries to reflect on this issue.  The study found that 27% of services were unnecessary.  I referred already to the figure of 50%.  The position in Ireland would be different because incentives here are different.<\/p><p>A total of 70% is inefficiencies.  It is not that the services are not effective but they are provided inefficiently.  Here it is about how it is provided at hospital level or at community level.  More and more we want to move the concept of hospital from a vertical structure to a horizontal structure together with units working together across levels of care rather than being totally integrated.  It is about severity hospitals rather than specialties.<\/p><p> If you were to go in the direction of insurance competition, like in the US, you have the problem with 24 excess and administrative costs, which is almost as much as unnecessary services.  There are inflated prices and prevention failures.  The Chairman asked whether the 40% is about perverse incentives.  I have to be cautious and everything should be taken with a pinch of salt.  There may be some inefficiencies in the way private health insurers are paid and the way they bypass the lists and so on.  I do not know how they are costed in detail.  Sometimes in other countries there is a hidden cross-subsidy when private patients are treated in public hospitals.  I do not know whether that is the case in Ireland.  That may be inefficient and a perverse incentive, as economists describe it.  The 40% is not a criticism of the profession and it is a genuine uncertainty.  Sometimes the system does not reward the professionals to save and to ignore these incentives.  For instance, I have the privilege to facilitate research into antibiotic resistance.  Doctors know they should not prescribe as many antibiotics.  There is huge scope for savings but, not only that, for quality.  Antibiotic resistance is a threat to our society.  If the Chairman wants a priority for this committee, he should adopt this.  I do not have data for the difference in prescribing antibiotic among doctors but I could look at my computer because we did a study for the Dutch Presidency on that subject.  The difference is massive.  It is sixfold between the Dutch and, say, the Italian and Spanish doctors, partly because of the pressure from patients to have an antibiotic.  If they have an antibiotic for a cold, that is a bad job.  It is not about blaming the doctors for this uncertainty; it is about giving them the mechanisms, evidence and ways to change.  In the case of antibiotic resistance, there have to be campaigns to work with citizens and say, \"More drugs after you see a doctor is not better care\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Figueras saying Dutch doctors prescribed more antibiotics than the Italians?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#R00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>No, they prescribe less.  It is a matter of principle for a family doctor in the Netherlands not to prescribe antibiotics.  I am married to a Dutch lady and I am a doctor.  I tried to get an antibiotic for my son because I knew he had acute bronchitis.  I could not get an antibiotic because she said you have to wait three or four days to make sure it is a bacterium.  Perhaps one can go too far.  It is a matter of principle.  It is good practice and part of their culture.  The population does not push to have antibiotics prescribed.  I am not blaming the profession for part of the 50%.  It is about lack of evidence, genuine uncertainty, lack of incentives to do better and lack of structural incentives to do things better.<\/p> <p>  This links nicely with the Chairman's point about ICT, which is fundamental.  Electronic medical record exchange between hospital, community and primary care saves a lot of money.  For instance, one of the major problems we have in recurring patients is side effects or counter indications by so many treatments.  Some recurring patients have 25 drugs.  Electronic records allow at any level of the system the ability to identify that to eliminate many of those drugs.  This not only saves money but improves the health status.  I do not know the position in Ireland.  I understood that electronic health records were well in place in primary care.  I read that somewhere but I cannot quantify that.  I also read there was a need for more integration between the primary, secondary and tertiary levels and access to them.  Important issues such as confidentiality need to be taken into account but electronic records exchange works well elsewhere.  Denmark and the Netherlands are doing well regarding integration, as is Finland, from which I have just returned.  They are making major efforts in this regard.  Let us be cautious about one aspect.  Not all technology and information will save money.  Yesterday, I attended a POLITICO summit.  The former Irish deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, was speaking there and she did a good job.  Private sector representatives were saying innovation and technology would result in savings but that is not true.  Technology is good and sometimes it is not.  Sometimes it wastes resources and is not cost effective.  The most important thing about information systems and technology in general is not whether the tool is cost effective but how it is integrated into the health system and where are the incentives for the nursing and other medical professionals to use it.  What is the incentive for a hospital to use telemedicine if in reality patients are being pushed away?  Perhaps that is what they want.  Introducing information systems in a way that fits the incentives of the organisation and of the professionals is what is helpful.<\/p> <p>  There was a good question about the big bang and the skills mix.  I am in favour of big bangs.  My philosophy is what is needed is incremental reforms with small big bangs.  If you do a big big bang, you are bound it get it wrong.  I have funny slides on that.  We have studies on the process of change.  We want incremental change and whenever there is a consensus, people should go for it and introduce the reform so it is a small big bang.  There is consensus with certainty.  I apologise for my way of speaking in a formal setting.  I hope members do not mind but I know in Ireland you are allowed to talk that way.  Members will appreciate that even if I am on television.  I hope that is okay.<\/p> <p>  Skills mix is one of the few areas that is difficult.  It is a political issue but it is a no-brainer.  We have plenty of evidence about the role of nursing and I totally agree with what the Chairman said about the role of nurses in community care and so on and the fact that we do not need so many professions to provide home care.  A nurse visiting the patient to give insulin or to check on treatment could give him or her food that day.  The cleaner, the home help or whomever could learn to do the dressing.  I am not trying to interfere with the role of the professionals and there are normative elements and regulatory and legal issues, of course.  Another issue is the incentives.  Why should nurses and so on give the food when another professional is there to do that?  Where are the incentives?  I will do that if I work on a team and know the others.  I will do that if I work in a team in a centre where I work with a social worker and with the home help.  If they work together, they know one another by name and are bound to help one other.  It is not just about regulation; it is about how these professionals work together.  However, the legal and regulatory issues are important.  Training is also an issue.  It is not enough to say that from tomorrow nurses have to do this new job.  Then there is the culture of the profession and, ultimately, the politics.  If, in Ireland, people manage to get the different professions sitting around a table and agreeing, I will congratulate them because that is difficult.  The professions will feel threatened but it is possible.  This works and the Chairman asked for examples of where it works.<\/p><p>One of Ireland's nearest neighbours, Scotland, is doing very good work on integrating home care, community care, social care and health care.  It is a very good example.  Some of the Nordic countries, including Finland, which I mentioned, have very good pilots.  I can forward to the committee evidence gathered in my capacity as an observer about good experiences there.  The Swedes are also doing good work, as are the Italians because at regional level they have the same budget for social care as for health care.  That helps because then there is no concern about protecting budgets.  There are other mechanisms about which I could speak in more detail if I had more time.<\/p><p> On the question regarding the ideal skill-mix in regard to addressing obesity, there are plenty of studies of how this works in different countries.  If context is important, it is very important here.  I will give an example for doctors.  Many countries believe general practitioners, GPs, should be incentivised to do more surgery.  However, many people would not want their general practitioner to be incentivised to carry out surgery on them because they do not believe their GPs are qualified to do so.  My wife recently brought our daughter, who was experiencing a gynaecological problem, to our local GP and the GP almost ran out of the surgery because he had never before dealt with a gynaecological problem in a child.  He was very afraid and was not prepared to deal with it.  There is no point prescribing a particular skill-mix if the doctors or nurses are not prepared to engage.  <\/p><p> In an ideal world, the skill-mix would include nurse practitioners, who would do a lot of the prescribing for chronic care, clinical control and screening; doctors who would have some level of specialty between them, all of whom would be working in health centres, if geographically possible; some general practitioner input in particular areas and more consultants - I do not think there are many incentives here in this regard but perhaps there are and I do not understand - working directly with the health system to support GPs in the area of specialised support of chronic care and much more work and incentives for co-operation with social, community and health workers, including physiotherapists and so on in a much more integrated way.  By way of example, in Belgium there are no gynaecological children services.  Even if it makes sense, it does not make sense to have a paediatrician in primary care.  There is no point telling a person, who is not trained for that, that paediatricians should be in primary care.  I am happy to send information on how the models in different countries work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The committee would be very interested in having that data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#S00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>They makes for good reading in bed.

The committee has met over the past number of weeks with many people from the primary health care sector.  If the committee were to suggest that as a first stop we should fund our primary health care system and properly manage it would that, in Dr. Figueras's opinion, be a good starting point for its work?  Spain appears to be top-of-the-class in this area.  I accept that there are issues in the Spanish health system but because of the work that it does at primary level, it rates far higher than its EU counterparts.  I am interested in hearing Dr. Figueras's opinion on that issue.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the percentage spend of GDP, Ireland is below 8%.  What does Dr. Figueras think is the optimum spend?  In other words, what amount, in terms of Dr. Figueras experience around the EU, should we be spending in this area?  I note that Ireland ranks third highest in the EU in terms of alcohol consumption and fourth highest in terms of smoking, which is not something of which we should be proud.  Is this relevant to our health issues; is there a need for us to strive to remove ourselves from among the top ten countries in that regard and would that have a significant impact on our health system?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing Dr. Figueras's opinion on bed capacity.

Dr. Figueras may be aware that this committee has only been in a place for a few months now.  He mentioned earlier that he recently carried out work in Finland similar to that which this committee is undertaking.  In that regard, does he work alone or does he have a team of people working with him and is the detailed analysis and statistics gathered in that regard a body of work in respect of which he needs assistance or does he do all of the work himself and how long does it take to do such a body of work?

We have a ten-year strategy for health that is primarily focused on how we will deliver a universal health care model.  Universal health access is something we would all very much strive to achieve.  However, we could have a universal health care system but bad health care if that system is under-funded and under-resourced.  In the context of universal health care and the provision of same across the European Union, during the downturn, for example, many budgets were squeezed and while universal access was still maintained I am certain that in some countries the quality of care available diminished, waiting times escalated and outcomes also diminished.  How do we put in place a system that provides for universal health care and also plan a funding model, which would be critically important, to guarantee some form of certainty in terms of the service?  When a country experiences a recessionary period there will be cutbacks, which goes back to the point about low hanging fruit and high fruit and so on.  There is a need for us to address that issue.  For example, almost half the population of Ireland have voluntary health insurance.  One could argue that it is out of fear of the public health system that people take out private health insurance but, at the same time, it is seen to be voluntary.  Should any government untangle what is effectively a voluntary tax by people in the sense they are willing to pay for private health cover and thereby lighten the burden on the public health system?  If we have to move to a model of universal health care in this country where or how do we fit the private health insurance and private health care system into that?  Reference was made to a big bang and small bangs but it would require a very big bang to move to such a system.

Thank you, Chairman.  I will start by addressing the way the Irish system operates.  I hope I have not offended anybody by using some expressions such as a pinch of salt or whatever.  The reason I have used such phrases is that I could talk about these issues at length and they are such big issues that one needs to use that type of approach to highlight the elements, but I do not want the use of those phrases to sound superficial.  In responding to the many questions I have been asked, I have to highlight flat-sitting areas in very superficial ways but I would be more than happy to return with my colleagues to address the members' questions in one session or separately, or to brief their staff properly in each of these areas with all the nuances that I have not been able to go into because if I were to describe these areas with any nuance, we would not get anywhere even after spending a few hours.<\/p> <p>  I would make another qualification.  In the context of the Netherlands, I used the example of my son.  He probably did not need antibiotics right away but I wanted to point out the importance of culture.  Perhaps I can address Deputy Kelleher's question.  With respect to prescriptions, there is a mix of factors involved.  It is a mix of the professional culture, how people are trained and how they view saving the use of antibiotics or saving the use of benzodiapzepines as important.  The Deputy made the point effectively regarding the expectations of the population.  Patients want a service as a consumer.  A substitution drug can be used.  A GP may decide not to give a patient an antibiotic but they may spend ten minutes explaining that the patient has a virus, that it is a bacteria and the patient may accept that.  There are issues about incentives, the issue of naming and shaming - again that comment can be taken with a pinch of salt - providing profiles of a GP's prescription practice against his or her colleagues, against the averages.  Guidelines can be provided, the health sector can work with a pharmacist and - to go further than the scope of the Deputy's question - not paying the pharmacist according to cost involved but rather reward generic prescribing and substitution, and prescribing according to generics rather than commercial names.<\/p> <p>  To talk about prescribing alone would take a session of this committee.  Members should avoid falling into giving them what they want.  There is a very sophisticated understanding among the policy makers of the issues.  I must congratulate the members on that, as I work in many countries.  They should avoid falling for the notion that one pill cures all ills.  With many reforms, there is the consideration of whether reference pricing will resolve all the  problems.  We can say we will argue with the profession and we will punish the doctors but this issue is how these incentives will work together and align.  If I had more time, I would be more than happy to explain that further.<\/p> <p>  The secret of my work is that if I do anything well I am standing on the shoulders of giants.  In that sense I will start with Ireland because the observatory is financed by a number of organisations and countries, including Ireland.  I would be happy to forward materials to the committee and I do not know if there are any other ways in which we can help, but it would be a privilege for me to do that.<\/p> <p>  I work with teams in Finland.   I mention Finland because this was done on Monday, not because it is more important.  We work in Slovenia, Sweden, France and many other countries, all partners of the observatory.  Depending on the evaluation involved, we gather different groups.  The case in Finland is an example.  It was very much a pre-evaluation of a reform proposal, which was particularly complex.  It is not dissimilar from what is being done in Ireland.  I wrote to colleagues in the OECD, in the WHO and members of various academic groups and others who were interested and then we had three weeks to examine this.  We said that if Finland wants to implement a particular reform, these are the questions they need to take into account.  There were not recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Finland is shown in green in the presentation.  It wants to reform its primary health care system.  If we look at the pendulum, it considers its primary health care does not allow sufficient choice. I link that with the Deputy's question on health coverage.  Finland's system does not allow patients to choose their GP.  It is too strict and too vertical.  It is good quality but is not responsive.  There is too much waiting in the system.  Finland wants to change it in a direction of having more choice and more responsiveness.  In this case I was the chair of a panel.  I presented yesterday and I met their Minister for Finance as well because they wanted to reduce the costs and we were explaining where the problems were.  In this case the panel brought experts from different organisations and different countries that are relevant to Finland.  Over two visits we then reflected on their worries.  For instance, if we want to introduce a  certain reform, we could say countries A, B, C are similar to Ireland and these are the kinds of issues with which they struggle and we need to be careful with issues one, two and three.  That is what we did.  We are always very cautious, we are never normative and we never recommend; we just reflect.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the idea of universal health coverage.  The question on it was asked well.  Universal health coverage does not mean, and I know the members know this, but I will say it anyway, a rigid, solid, non-choice health system.<\/p><p>We have Greens here and in many countries.  We have been in the Netherlands.  We have Greens in Denmark.  I talk about the Netherlands but let us talk about Denmark.  Denmark is a country where one can go to a general practitioner and it is paid <i>per capita<\/i>with some adjustments.  One can change one's GP every year.  However, they say &quot;No, I prefer choice&quot;.  I choose whatever GP I like and I pay a percentage, not all of it, out of pocket.  The rest is paid by the state.  If I want choice, it is like France.  In France, they have been trying very hard to move from the fee for service to have GPs working on lists.  That is one of the areas we worked on with them.  That is why we are talking about payment for performance because they want to change from a fee for service to some form of payment for performance.  That is because there is no way to move a doctor who is paid by fee for service to a capitation model.  It is terribly difficult.  They do not like it and I understand that.  That is why we debate payment for performance with them.  What they did in France was as follows.  As a patient, one is happy to join a GP and accept gatekeeping.  Then, there is a charge.  One pays to go to a specialist and it is much lower.  If one wants to shop around and go directly to a specialist, that is fine but the user charge will be higher.  Unless one uses that to bypass the waiting lists as happens in some countries like here, actually, for hospitals, it is a way to make the system sustainable and have good quality care.  Those who want more choice, pay an additional amount to have it.  What I am trying to say is that self-coverage systems do not need to be rigid with doctors and so on and only one choice.  One can still have choice of different kinds.  In terms of paying the providers, one can have elements not only of salary, but adjusted capitation, some fee for service, incentives and some elements of payment for performance.  One can achieve a good universal health coverage system while having flexibility of incentives and choice to respond to consumers, or patients, as well as to the professionals.<br\/><br\/>As to the question of the percentage, the big bang, and the numbers, I do not have the data with me and I would not trust it in any event.  It is impossible to know how much goes into primary health care and hospital care because there is a world in the middle.  If the committee invites the OECD here, it will tell the members that it is doing the numbers, but it is very difficult to know how they are calculated.  I cannot remember the numbers.  One of the members asked me about the percentage of primary health care in terms of the budget not being very high in Ireland.  Did I understand that well?  I do not have the numbers with me and I will not be able to comment.  However, I am happy to respond in written form.  Whatever my response, I ask the committee to understand that these numbers are very difficult to assess.  We need to look at whether we are providing the proper benefit package in primary care and whether treatment is being provided at the right level.  These are the ways to look at it, not the percentage, unless one has a scandalous and very clear difference in the amount put into primary health care versus hospital care.  Most countries are in the range of &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,000 and most towards &euro;1,500.  Again, it all depends on what one asks a GP to do and whether he or she has a team to assist.  Is it a rural area and is there a payment for deprivation?  One wants to provide an incentive for GPs to go to deprived and rural areas.  Therefore, talking about the numbers is not the right approach.  It is about services and risk adjustment.<br\/><br\/>That links very much with the question about the small big bangs and big bangs, not only for primary care but for the whole system as such and, as part of this big bang, what do we do to help insurance and universal health coverage.  I really like only to do reflections not recommendations.  Ireland has very good professionals that serve it here and who can work with the committee and would be better than me.  My impression would be &quot;Why not do it progressively?&quot;.  If the members think it is a good idea, put it in legislation.  As Ireland has this medical card system, it could try to increase the number of cards over a short period to a point where no one needs one.  New populations could be brought on board in a progressive way so that the impact can be examined.  Ireland has the funding for that.  If it links it with the appropriate benefit package simultaneously with the PCTs, much more effective primary care will result which will save money in hospital care and waiting lists.  Ireland can manage that with some savings.  While I said savings are difficult, that could be managed by having more cost-effective services.  Inefficiencies in the system could be shed quickly so that it does not need to be much more expensive.  The way to cover oneself is to do it incrementally.  To be very clear, I think this committee may wish to say - sorry that is almost a recommendation - that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#T02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Sorry.

What I am saying is that there are a lot of complex incentives in the system.  I wish one could do a big bang, but my impression is that we still cannot predict very well what would happen with a big bang in coverage in primary care.  The costs might explode.  As such, one has to do it incrementally.  At the same time as one has the PCTs working and a good benefit package in place, one tries to have more integration.  One wants to do it in an incremental way so that all these other changes in the skills mix happen simultaneously.<\/p> <p>  I wish a big bang approach was possible.  I agree that the legislation needs to be very clear.  There is a need to go to universal health coverage for primary care.  It may be desired to leave some user charges which are means tested.  I link that to the other question.  Of course, one needs the money coming from somewhere.  Even with user charges, there is a question about private health insurance.  We need the money to come from somewhere.  I understand that.  All countries, as the members have seen, have an element of private health insurance and user charges.  I am not suggesting one can or one should.  It is a political and societal value.  Many people take private health insurance because they are afraid.  I understand that and that, as such, one cannot withdraw it.  However, what we are talking about is how to use user charges in as efficient and equitable a way as possible.  Can we have value-based user charges?  Can one use user charges in areas where we know they are less effective, although it may not be ethical to apply user charges for things that are not effective?  There are ways to tailor user charges.<\/p> <p>  There is one area on which I have data but not the time to show that to the committee.  It relates to the caps in Ireland which are a bit high.  We want to have user charges with lower caps.  It becomes almost like a tax because everyone will reach that.  However, the &euro;750 cap in Ireland is fairly high.  Is it &euro;475 in hospital care after &euro;750?  For part of the population, that seems to be a fair amount of money.  I cannot remember the examples by heart but I have them there.  Sometimes I felt that there may be a wish to introduce caps on that.  Certainly, it is the same as to whether antibiotics are free.  Clearly, for chronic care, and I think Ireland does it already, one does not want to have user charges.  For certain groups, one does not want to have user charges.  I have the evidence and there are much better experts in this country to discuss it.  Certainly, it is possible to keep user charges while ensuring they are better tailored, have as little impact on equity as possible and are as efficient as possible.  The same is true with private health insurance.  All countries have private health insurance which has a role to play.  However, we should use it in more complementary way rather than in supplementary ways.  What about having health insurance in services that are not covered by the package of care?  To be more explicit, I refer to dental care and ophthalmic care.<\/p> <p>  I relate this to the question on what we do with the recession and the limit.  I could talk about that.  I work with ECOFIN on the complexities of health care in the semester context.<\/p><p>There are recommendations this semester.  I guess the committee has read the semester recommendations for Ireland in health care, the sustainability, the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs recommendations, which try to explain how to work together on these limits and the need to sustain the system and cut costs.  I do not want to go far but there are ways in which voluntary health insurance can be used.  I think Ireland has a fairly high percentage in comparative terms.  It is in the slides if the committee members have the time to look at them.  That is fine if that is Ireland's decision.  There are ways to operate it better, to make sure it does not have progress incentives for more hospitalisation, ways to make it perhaps a bit more complementary.  I would not recommend, however, that it be complementary for user charges.  Please consider that before going for voluntary health insurance.  I have been working with Slovenia which wants to use voluntary health insurance for user charges and Ireland does not want to do that because if it pays, as in France, if everybody gets voluntary health insurance which pays user charges there is a moral hazard.  People will try to use the service as much as possible.  The problem with user charges is moral hazard.  I do not believe it works but if there are user charges to collect money one has to ensure that the services are used appropriately.  If Ireland decides to put in place voluntary health insurance, those who are poor will not be able to access it.  The French subsidised the \"mutuelles\" for voluntary health insurance to complement user charges.  Excellent, but what is the point?  The patient has an insurer and it pays the hospital which pays the patient back.  What is the idea?  The money might as well be given directly.  We do not need the middle man to do that.  Once that is introduced it cannot be changed.  We could not change it in Slovenia.  It is a no-go area because the population perceived it as very valuable, which is the point the Deputy made.  If Ireland reforms private health insurance the Government should read the book and talk to experts - it has many in this country - about how best to keep it because it values the principle but it needs to get value for money and not too many inequities.  <\/p><p> To answer the question about the big bang and all those issues, for the universal health coverage in primary health care it is better to have an incremental system within a limited period, perhaps two or three years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>When Dr. Figueras talks about being incremental does he mean extending the different cohorts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#V00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Josep Figueras"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>He started saying benefits packages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016101200002#V00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>If there is consensus in this group, by all means, I do not know enough of the politics, go ahead.

We are concerned about the limited targets the European Union is imposing on member states.  The semester process, however, is becoming more complex and sophisticated, not that it was not sophisticated before but it understands much better the health element, that well-being is something measurable, that productivity and a healthy population are the only way to compete in this global economy.<\/p> <p>  The first point I made to the Minister for Finance is that he can negotiate with it and demonstrate that when it understands the country's situation it may be more relaxed about the 3% and allow for a larger deficit if it is to prove that it is investing in integrated care and primary care and so on.  I do not think the targets are so fixed, even at that level.  There is some flexibility.<\/p> <p>  Yes, there should be an investment fund.  I wish I had the time to tell the committee about the experience of the crisis.  During the crisis there was rationing and there were waiting lists but at the same time we saw improvements in primary care; there was more discerning use of some cost-effective services; better use of technology; and there were huge, important necessary cuts, such as cost-effectiveness in the pharmaceutical bill.  It is true there is not money for everything, and rationing and waiting lists are on the horizon.  There will be a need for some private insurance for the less important elements of the package of care.  I wish that was not the case but we need to do that.  Before doing that, please do some more work on the 50% we talked about.  There is a lot of savings to be accrued there that we can work on.  There are lots of savings in the long term.  Integrated care will not yield savings in the short term but in the long term it will give more help and may accrue in savings, particularly in Ireland, in the way the resources are used at hospital level.  There are ways to be sustainable but some element of private insurance will be there.  Let us not have it just because of its value but make sure that money comes from my pocket as a pension as well, let us use it cost-effectively and equitably if possible.<\/p> <p>  I am sure I missed a lot of points.

All of this flows from pillar 3 of the action plan for housing and homelessness which correctly identifies land supply, land management and the availability of ready to go sites with planning permission as very important parts of ensuring there is a well-functioning development sector and market for land, which obviously feeds back into affordability and supply.  Banks and financial institutions tend not to lend to persons intending to develop land without live planning permission with some time to go.  The only lenders to purchasers seeking to purchase land to seek permission to build on are private equity, high interest lenders or people with a lot of cash to deploy.  If one looks at the property press and sources of information about development sites that are trading and so on, one can see that there is quite a shortage of ready to go sites that have been through the planning process and have recent permission with several years to run.  This is a very strong message coming from the sector.  The information available to us is that the length and risk involved with the planning application process are becoming major deterrents to lenders.  It is the scarcity of ready to go sites with permission rather than the raw amount of zoned land that is an important issue in terms of ensuring the affordable supply of land, etc.  There has been much comment about the duration or efficacy of the planning process at the moment, which very much comes from the legislation and what is theoretically possible.<\/p> <p>  As we review planning applications that are being handled by local authorities, principally in Dublin and other major urban areas, we are looking at how this pans out on the ground.  The second slide summarises the typical process duration for large applications.  In respect of the pre-application consultation process, it can take up to six weeks to get an appointment.  There may be several meetings involved and someone could arguably be looking at two or three months going through that phase before they get into a position to have enough information to hand to finalise and submit their planning application.  As many commentators have said, local authorities can determine a planning application within eight weeks but we would see that most planning applications for large housing applications are subject not only to additional information requests but clarification of additional information requests.  This tends to drag out the process to six months or more.  This begs the question as to how efficiently the pre-application consultation process is working in the first place if all of these issues have not been ironed out at that stage.  <\/p> <p>  As our opening statement concludes, the vast majority of large housing applications are appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la so that is another four to five months.  To give members a better flavour of what is happening on the ground, we asked our colleagues in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to look at a batch of large applications - 100 plus applications - that were considered and decided by Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2016.  We could have gone back a bit further but there have been very few applications of that scale because of the economic crash in previous years.  There were about 18 cases we were able to look at in 2016.  It is quite a complex process because one is literally opening up files and trying to go through the chronology of all the steps that led to a file.  This is an initial and ongoing analysis so we may need to come back and vary some of this.  What jumps out at us is that the average period taken to get permission, taking into account the planning authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la phases, is about a year.  The best case scenario would be a bit better than that at 26 weeks for the planning authority and 18 weeks for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is important to stress that An Bord Plean&aacute;la achieves pretty much all its statutory objective period, SOP, objectives in terms of housing applications.  It prioritises planning appeals for large housing applications.  The longest case, to which I will return, took 82 weeks, or 18 months, to get through the process.  What is also striking is that most local authority decisions on large housing applications are invariably upheld.  Some are varied.  What is also striking in terms of the analysis is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la tends to dramatically reduce the number of conditions attaching so that comments on whether or not local authorities are getting into excessive detail on the matters they regulate by way of condition.  <\/p> <p>  Our view would be that the current two stage process is taking 12 to 18 months or longer in some cases.<\/p><p>We believe the current two-stage process is taking 12 to 18 months or, in some cases, longer.  This brings limited added value because effectively applicants get the same decision at the end of the process.  This really starts to hit home when we look at the financial implications.  Let us assume a site cost of &euro;40,000 per home, which is an average site cost - obviously, some will be lower and some considerably higher.  Anyway, purchasing a site for 200 homes on that basis would cost approximately &euro;8 million.  The holding cost of that if we work on an assumption of 10% interest and so on is, approximately, &euro;4,000 per home per year.  It is the home purchaser or renter who picks up the holding cost at the end of the day, because that is the way of it in the context of a viable development.  This really has and can have a significant impact on affordability.<\/p><p> We picked out two case studies.  They are represented by the first of the bar charts on display.  The bar chart is self-explanatory.  It has a development of 284 units and a development of 410 units.  What is striking about these two schemes is that they are effectively NAMA-backed projects.  They are well funded and have well-organised design teams and so on.  The committee will see that the 284 unit development spent approximately 14 weeks in the pre-application stage.  Then it was in the local authority for 50 weeks.  Then, the An Bord Plean&aacute;la process dealt with it in 18 weeks.  In the case of the other development the period was 53 weeks.  These may be at the outer end, but these are exactly the scale of projects that we need to deal with the housing crisis, but they are taking in effect 18 months or more to get through the process.<\/p><p> The next bar chart compares averages that we might look at in the context of the batch of 18 or so cases.  We have more work to do to finesse this, but upon initial analysis we can see that the comparison between this process and the fast-track process is stark, with a difference between 18 months on the one hand and a guaranteed process of determination within 25 weeks on the other hand, albeit in a straight \"Yes\" or \"No\" situation.  This highlights the importance of the pre-application process, getting it right, getting everyone around the table, understanding the issues and positioning in order that a final decision can be made.<\/p><p> The map on the next slide shows the general shape of and how large cases before the board have been dealt with over the past decade.  We are grateful to our colleagues in the board for providing us with this information.  Again, it has a metropolitan focus.  This is really an issue for Dublin, Cork and other large urban centres such as Galway.  To some extent it applies to the Dublin commuter belt as well.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Sheridan.  There are two slides that go through the main processes of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la direct process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The slide on the display screen adverts to a pre-application process with a nine-week timeframe for the initial pre-application consultation between the board, the local authority and the developer.  There is a one-and-a-half to two week period for validation of the application.  Then there is a four-week period for the planning authority to submit a report on the pre-application.  Following that, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will organise a meeting between the relevant parties.  Furthermore, during that timeframe the inspector will initiate preparation of his pre-application report.  Then, finally, it is for the board to outline and make its decision on whether the application is sufficiently comprehensive to proceed.  A mandatory maximum nine-week period applies under this process.  Normally, the timeframes provided for in the planning Acts are statutory objective periods, SOPs, which can go beyond the periods set out in the legislation.  However, in this case there is a mandatory guaranteed nine-week timeframe.<\/p> <p>  There is a 16-week period for the application phase.  In this phase, the normal public consultation overseen by local authorities takes place in planning applications.  There is a five-week period for the public, elected members, interested parties and prescribed bodies to make their submissions to the board.  The planning authority then has an additional three weeks to submit its report to the board on the proposed development.  That will take account of the public submissions received during the public consultation phase.  Then, we move on to the inspector's report after receipt of the local authority report on the proposed development.  Finally, the board has a couple of weeks to make its final decision.  In this case, we are talking about a maximum of 16 weeks for the board to make a decision on an application.  It is important to point out that an application will not get through to the board unless everything is ironed out at pre-application stage.  A number of requirements apply.  For example, the site must be serviced by the necessary infrastructure, with roads, water, etc.  All the documentation, including layout plans, house types, density and all of required information to make a decision on a planning application has been provided.  Only at that stage, when an application gets the green light after the pre-application consultation stage, can the planning application be submitted to the board.  Effectively, as Mr. Cussen has pointed out, we are talking about cutting down and condensing the decision-making process for large-scale housing developments from 70 or 80 weeks plus to a maximum of 25 weeks.  This will shorten the decision timeframe substantially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I wish to flag that what is proposed in the legislation with regard to planning and other issues is simply the first tranche.

The team has been introduced already.  The Irish Planning Institute represents approximately 700 professional planners across the public, private, semi-state and academic sectors.  At the outset I am keen to say that we recognise the current housing situation.  The institute assists in delivering the housing units required to try to resolve the situation.  However, we have queries on a number of aspects of the proposed legislation.<\/p> <p>  In Dublin there is potential to deliver approximately 46,000 homes on lands zoned where essential services already exist.  Approximately nine in ten applications were granted by local authorities last year.  Two thirds of these were decided within eight weeks.  That is based on our basic research.<\/p> <p>  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la 2015 report notes that all appeals involving larger multi-unit housing developments have been decided within the statutory compliance time limit of 18 weeks.  We question how it can be said that the planning system is targeted or frequently cited as the main constraint on supply.  Permission is not always the issue.  It is a question of activating the permission.  Once an applicant gets permission, how does the applicant build out the plans in terms of dealing with compliance submissions and having houses in place?  It is all very well getting planning permission, but delivery is really the issue.<\/p> <p>  A threshold of 100 homes is referred to in the legislation.  We have a query in this regard.  The current system allows for third-party planning appeals.<\/p><p>Given that the centralisation of the planning system in terms of taking more applications directly into An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not set out in any Government policy, we are unclear as to where it sits.  Will there be more applications or strategic infrastructure development, SID, type legislation be introduced to deal with other aspects of planning?<\/p><p> The IPI believes spatial planning is a fundamental local government function which should be primarily delivered at local level with reference to the principle of subsidiarity.  Again, we made the point a number of years ago regarding the Department in its recent statement of strategy consultation.  Other than anecdotal evidence that the housing action plan has not identified any systematic difficulties associated with the development management system which might form a basis for requiring all applications for 100-plus residential units being made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we need information that can be given, including details of the evidence basis for choosing the threshold of 100 units.  Has research demonstrated this is a particular threshold at which applications are consistently coming into the planning system, or is it less or more?  We also need information on the evidence basis for the cumulative floor space threshold of other uses in mixed-use schemes and clarity on how it is proposed to deal with, for example, student accommodation.<\/p><p> There is a presumption against further information requests in the proposed legislation and oral hearings.  An analysis of the issues that necessitate further information requests and oral hearings would be welcomed.  The housing action plan has set a timeline for a root-and-branch review of the planning system to be undertaken by the first quarter of 2017.  We are unclear as to the format this might take and whether it can be accomplished in the timeframe.  It was referred to in the previous presentation.<\/p><p> We represent planning practitioners at a variety of levels and our members have reviewed the proposed legislation.  There are several issues regarding its practical implementation.  It is vital that we encourage rather than reduce public involvement at all stages of the planning process.  This would be a key role of the office of the planning regulator and is also one the IPI has advocated for many years.  The proposed legislation further removes communities from their local authorities and the development plan and decision-making process.  The recent review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la outlined difficulties with the strategic infrastructure process, which can lead to significant delays in decision making.  Having regard to the lack of appeal of such decisions, there is an increased risk of legal challenges.  There appears to be a large number of judicial reviews taken on current SID applications.  This must be considered in the timeframe of delivering developments and planning permissions.<\/p><p> Without clear anti-avoidance measures, the legislation would not be effective.  It is not clear how phased sub-threshold applications would be dealt with.  The legislation is not accompanied by commitment for extra resources for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to deliver the requirements.  The institute suggests strong consideration should be given to ensuring planning authorities are properly resourced in the first place to deal with the issues discussed previously regarding lengthy pre-application planning consultations and how they can be made better and more effective before removing them from the local authorities and diverting them to be dealt with by a different body, which presumably would then require additional resourcing.<\/p><p> The legislation allows for compliance matters with conditions to be dealt with by planning authorities but is silent on the timeframes associated with compliance.  The agreement of compliance issues before commencement of development can be a very major issue for the delivery of developments that have planning permissions.  The proposed structures could result in increased costs for applicants for housing developments.  The cost of third-party submissions to the process is unclear.  It is unclear whether it will remain the same as the &euro;20 fee people currently pay or will be the &euro;50 people pay for SID applications.  While the Bill names Irish Water, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Transport Authority as consultees, it is unclear why these bodies are listed.  Other prescribed bodies that typically are consulted on applications such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the development applications unit and various others are not listed.<\/p><p> More easily, rapid response teams project managed by a professional planner or appropriate individual in a local authority who has responsibility for co-ordinating housing applications within that planning authority from the pre-planning phase through to the compliance stage could be put in place in local authorities.  Greater co-ordination between bodies such as TII and local authorities, funding for essential infrastructure, addressing land costs and improved compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers to assemble sites are all factors that could play a part in increasing housing output.  Addressing deficiencies in the existing planning code which have been identified as impeding the efficient delivery of housing should be prioritised.  For example, statutory timeframes around compliance submissions would be welcomed.  The consolidation of planning legislation is difficult for planning practitioners, never mind the public, to understand at times.  The onus is on applicants to engage appropriate teams of professionals in order to assemble applications.  We encourage the committee to support the institute's call for the regulation of the title \"planner\" to ensure qualified and trained individuals would offer and lead such planning teams.  It could be done by placing a definition of \"planner\" in the legislation and detailing the role of professional planners.<\/p><p> The IPI wishes to work constructively with the Department.  Given the experience of our practitioners in the public and private sector, in the event that the legislation is passed we would like to work through the specifics of the Bill so we do not find ourselves in 12 months' time with a miscellaneous Bill to tidy up glitches we anticipate could happen with the legislation.  We are very open to working with the Department through a working group for something like this to occur.  I thank committee members for this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the Department and the IPI for their attendance.  I had considered the IPI's correspondence and report to us in advance and am highly impressed with it.  It is very important to ask what are the real issues.  The report of the housing supply co-ordination task force for Dublin stated there was the potential for 46,000 homes on land zoned, with essential services including roads and supply already in place.  More than 33,000 units have permission and 7,000 are in the planning process.  The planning system therefore cannot be solely blamed for the shortage of residential properties.  These are facts from a report which I received from the Department.  I did not make them up.<\/p> <p>  This week, I wrote to the Minister about a mapping exercise in a small part of south County Dublin, namely, Kiltiernan-Glenamuck.  I was supplied with a map identifying the permissions and grants for 2,434 housing units.  Some of them have subsequently withered.  It is a section 49 catchment area and there are three levies, namely, the B1 Luas levy, the standard section 48 levy and the section 49 levy.  The planning levy for a one-bedroom unit is &euro;70,000.  I had this confirmed this morning.  To produce a five-bedroom unit in the same area the levy is the same: &euro;70,000.  Where is the logic?  This levy scheme has been in place for eight years.  A local authority has not carried out a review of the section 48 levy.<\/p><p>That is an impediment to development and bringing houses on-stream on land that is zoned residential.  I dropped that letter into the Minister and I asked him to raise it with the chief executive.  I also attached the maps, the folio numbers, the planning reference and everything else.  They are facts that need to be investigated by someone in the Department.<\/p><p> I want to touch on a few areas.  In 1999, special provision was inserted in Article 28A of the Constitution about democracy and engagement with local authorities.  For the first time ever in our Constitution, we provided special status for communication with regard to local councils.  In terms of my concern, it is about this appeals process.  We operate a very successful third party appeals process.  This is a democracy.  Yes, there is a crisis.  Everyone in this room wants more houses to be built, and we want them delivered quickly and on track.  There is no dispute about that, but we cannot compromise the engagement of local elected members who are elected to represented people in communities to articulate their concerns about a whole range of matters.  This is one of them.  Have the witnesses touched on, or got any legal advice on, that?  Do they consider that their proposals water down that in way?  I consider that to be the case.  I would like to hear what they have to say about that.<\/p><p> With regard to the appeals process, what exactly is the fee?  There will be no appeals process, so we are telling citizens they will not be able to appeal.  The witnesses should tell that to the county councillors when people come in to complain about a development with which they are unhappy.  They say that the parties in Leinster House voted it out and there is no appeals process.  That is most unsatisfactory.  The question of the fees needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> What resources is the Department giving to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for this new imaginative scheme?  Have the witnesses considered seconding planners to or taking planners from local authorities into the board or giving them specific roles within the board for a two or three year period?  That is the sunset clause they spoke about.  What engagement is going on with planners?  What do the 31 local authorities think of the watering down of their functions?  They are demoralised.  I have spoken to a number of planners in local authorities in the past few weeks.  That is an important point.<\/p><p> What about resourcing local authorities?  They have local knowledge and local expertise, and they develop relationships on a range of issues.  That is important.<\/p><p> On the strategic infrastructure development, SID, we know there are projects going on but on one major project in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, An Bord Plean&aacute;la missed its 18 week schedules on three occasions.  It does not seem to have any idea of it.  When I rang An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently, I was told me it had not even completed its report of an oral hearing that took place last October.  It is now October 2016.  A month ago the inspector had not been in a position to finalise her report for the board, so there are weaknesses in that process.<\/p><p> I am definitely against this proposal.  There has been correspondence from the Minister today on the fast-tracking or waiving the pre-scrutiny legislation.  I am against waiving anything if it waters down the participation of the citizens of this country in the planning process.  I am all on for fast-tracking projects.  I am all on for the plan and for delivering the houses, but I am against any undermining of planners and the citizens in the process.  The witnesses are weak on that.<\/p><p> I will make two points to Mr. Walsh.  He stated that this was a suite of measures.  The Irish Planning Institute witnesses talked about the need for the consolidation of the planning Acts.  Mr. Walsh might outline his plans for that.  There is real role for the planning regulator, and I would like to hear Mr. Walsh's plans for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#D00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentations.  Part of the purpose of today's meeting is because the proposed planning changes represent a profound change to the planning system, particularly for the large developments, so we are looking for as much information as possible before many of us make decisions.  While I am intuitively not in favour of the particular proposal, I am open to persuasion, depending on the evidence presented to us.  My questions are on that basis.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions on the PowerPoint presentation and the legislation, and then questions for the Irish Planning Institute witnesses, which I will go through one by one.<\/p> <p>  The third bullet point on page 1 of the presentation is about a fundamental shortage of ready to go sites.  How many ready to go sites with planning permission are there across the State?  What number of units does that represent?  We would like to know that figure.  The first bullet point on page 2 indicates that it takes up to six weeks to get an appointment.  Is that an average figure?  Is that due to staffing or other reasons?  The second bullet point on planning applications is about requests for further information.  From my experience in South Dublin County Council, one of the biggest delays in the county council end of a planning application was that process of requesting further information.  That is an important process because it is the point at which the planning authority gets to assess compatibility with the development plan, local area plans, etc.  Has the Department taken a view on the reason that exchange of information can take so long?  Is it poor quality planning applications or that local authorities are being awkward?  There must be some reason for that.<\/p> <p>  I am also unsure as to the logic of the second sub-point under that bullet point, which states that because these mechanisms for further information are available and there is a likelihood of the planning authority requesting them, applicants are encouraged to send in applications in the knowledge that they will be asked to provide further information.  I would have thought that everything the Department is saying in this presentation is the very opposite of that because there is a financial cost to delaying it.  There will be huge pressure from the developer, the architects and the consultants to make sure the planning application is done to the very best of their ability to ensure there are not further requests for information.  I would like to know the basis on which the witnesses are making that statement.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the initial analysis of the 2016 decided cases, how many cases does that involve and over what period of time?  I am confused because we were told in one of the first notes on the general scheme that we were looking at an 18 to 24 months process but the witnesses have told us that the average is a one year process, which is shorter than that.  The problem with averages is that they do not necessarily tell us what happens in the majority of cases because a very small number of very big outliers, either short or long, can stretch out the average.  Will the witnesses give us the full data on which this PowerPoint is based so that we can drill underneath the figures, so to speak, and make an assessment?  Of the total number of cases, how many of those are happening within the 12 month period?  Of the cases that are taking between 12 and 18 months, what percentage of the cases the witnesses studied does that affect?<\/p> <p>  The second last bullet point on that page indicates a potential cost of &euro;4,000 per home, and approximately a 10% interest.  Perhaps I do not understand this but I would have presumed that is a 10% interest charge on the loan yet at the start of the presentation the witnesses told us that part of the difficulty for these developers, and one of the reasons they are proposing these changes, is that they cannot get the loans.  If they do not have the loans, am I right in thinking there is no interest charge?  If I have it wrong, the witnesses might clarify that for me.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of additional questions on the legislation.  If this proposal goes through, where does enforcement lie?  Will enforcement lie with the local authority in the relevant area or will it be similar to strategic infrastructure projects like roads, for example, where there is no statutory enforcement body?  Which of those two will be the outcome of this process?<\/p> <p>  I have a concern about the ability of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make the very detailed assessments of the planning applications.  We have 30 or 40 local authorities with different development plans, local area plans, etc., and there is a lot of specialised expertise in the relevant planning authorities.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la could not be expected to have that same level of information so by removing the local authority from that detailed assessment, are the witnesses confident that the staff, and I am not casting aspersions on the quality of the staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la as their function is different, have the level of expertise in terms of all those development plans and local area plans to make those same assessments that happen in that first phase?  I would be concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the pre-application process, which is a really good idea, why was that not considered as a statutory requirement with the local authorities, with statutory timeframes for that?  Was that considered and, if so, why was it rejected?<\/p> <p>  I echo Senator Boyhan's point about third party and community consultation appeals and oral hearings.  There is a real concern in that it is already very difficult for third parties to have any meaningful impact on the planning process because it requires such a specialised level of technical expertise.  Local councillors and community organisations could make submissions.  They are usually subjective opinions and not reasoned, planning based opinions.  Are the witnesses satisfied that reducing the ability of third parties to engage, appeal and have oral hearings will not reduce the quality of the final planning decisions?<\/p><p>The heads of the Bill contain a large section on environmental impact assessments and nobody has mentioned them.  It is one of the bits of the legislation that concerns me most, particularly with large applications.  I would like to hear more about the rationale for trying to reduce the reliance or need for an environmental impact assessment.  That is what the legislation seems to suggest.  What is the rationale behind the suggestion?<\/p><p> A section of the Bill mentions additional powers for the Minister.  I always get nervous when I hear the phrase \"additional powers of the Minister\", particularly when he or she gets to award himself or herself additional powers.  I would like to know more about the provision, what is envisaged and what checks and balances are in place.  A small section of the legislation deals with Part V provision.  My reading of it is the provision does not affect Part V obligations in those developments but I would like that to be confirmed.<\/p><p> In terms of the legislation, nobody has talked about Part VIII.  Can the witnesses confirm if my reading of the head is correct?  There will be the regular eight-week consultation and then the local authority must take a decision within six weeks.  That means the process will take 14 weeks.  If that is the case then it is a good thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#E00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Yes, it is very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Yes, that is clear.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Irish Planning Institute.

I would like to tease out a number of the heads of the Bill that have been presented to us, specifically head number 5.  I question what has been presented in terms of the 25-week process.

No timeframe has been stipulated for the process that has been presented here today.  If I have read the Bill correctly, that process must be gone through before entering section 37S.  Following on from that, almost every piece of detail that is required to make a decision must be submitted, including the reports from the local authority.  It is most disappointing and frustrating that even when one has gone through the nine-week process, one will still not know whether an environmental impact statement is wanted.  One must then request further information, as pointed out in head 5(16), to make a determination on whether development of a class as specified in the regulations made under the section will require an EIS, and that means another four weeks.  If a Natura 2000 statement is required then it will be another four weeks, as referred to in head 5(16).  That means there is an additional eight-week process before one submits the planning application to the board directly.  Equally, is there a process where the board can look for further clarificatory information?  If that is available, then there will be a further time delay.<\/p> <p>  I am slightly concerned about the lack of transparency on fees, as they can be a reason to stop a development commencing.  There will be problems down the road until we have a transparent fees system.  Finally, I ask the institute to give some examples of what is delaying the process in terms of compliance so that we can try to deal with them in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#F00600","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Casey.

A long list of questions have been asked.  I might answer some of them myself and I shall pass the remainder to my colleagues, Mr. Terry Sheridan and Mr. Niall Cussen, as needed.<\/p> <p>  I shall address some of the points raised by the institute in the first instance.  A questions was asked about whether there has been a move towards a centralisation policy.  The action plan on housing has identified and acknowledged that we have a dysfunctional market, a crisis and a need to accelerate and expand all forms of delivery.  It is solely within that context that the legislation has been framed; it is not a lever to start drawing other things inwards.  It is very clearly defined within a band of 100-plus housing units and for a time-limited period as well.  <\/p> <p>  The importance of the local function of spatial planning and policy has been acknowledged.  That remains the case because under the system, through the development plan, the local area plan and other processes, it is the function of the local authorities to provide that context.  Applications submitted under this system will only be considered where the lands have been zoned or had local area planning within that process.  We do not assume that lands will jump and shall not pre-empt any decisions that will be taken as to the appropriateness of those locations for housing development as members and others will have signalled.  <\/p> <p>  Some of the other issues raised are more cogent and relevant to the root-and-branch review, which is obviously a policy issue separate from the Bill.  I can assure the committee that as part of this broad review of planning, a lot of the issues that have been flagged will be considered.  We have not set the broad terms for planning.  The action plan states it will be a root-and-branch review of all aspects of planning.  I am sure that the Department would be happy to engage with the institute, other public bodies and this committee in terms of trying to elicit many views on what is working and what can be done to further enhance the system.  Perhaps a lot of those issues are not relevant to the core of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Having the public involved in decision-making was mentioned and it is a view reflected by other members of the committee.  As Mr. Sheridan has outlined, there will be a full opportunity, on the same basis as currently available, for third parties or interested parties to submit their views.  The fees will be no more.  In fact, fees are not covered in the primary Act and are always covered in regulations.  The fees in respect of applications, third-party observations and prescribed bodies all will be dealt with in the regulations that will follow and flow from the Act.  We can give assurances that the current rates charged for making a submission to a local authority planning application will be exactly the same, if not less than or no more than, what goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is &euro;20 as it stands.  <\/p> <p>  The delays associated with strategic infrastructure and the controversy and issues that may have been generated at local level have been flagged.  We are using, in very broad terms, the structure and process associated with strategic infrastructure but very much recognise these applications are not of the same complexity.  In all cases they will not involve an environmental impact assessment, EIA, because it would require a much longer period.<\/p> <p>  In response to the point made by Deputy Casey, as part of the initial pre-consultation process that will be formalised between the board, the local authority and the proposer of the development, the assessment as to whether an EIA is required will be decided then.  If an EIA is required the process will take longer because it would involve a full environmental impact statement, EIS, as required.  It means that it would be premature to lodge an application with the board until such time as the EIS and the assessment by the board could be delivered. <\/p> <p>  In terms of issues around resources for the board, of course that is not a matter for the Bill.  The Minister has signalled in the past and in our discussions with the board, it already has signalled the requirements in terms of administrative and technical supports, to create a strategic housing unit.  The board is engaged with the Department and as we are prepared to fully stock the board with the necessary skills and supports to ensure it can fulfil the mandatory timeline, that should not be an issue.  By the time this Bill is enacted the board will have an operating strategic unit set up and will be ready to deal with all applications from day one.<\/p><p>On the question of compliance and enforcement timeframes, the local authorities will be the enforcement authorities.  The timelines that apply elsewhere in the Bill will apply to enforcing developments.  <br\/><br\/>On the question of increased costs for developers, that is a substantial issue that will be dealt with as part of a broader issue of costs in the system and the ability of the system to capture the full costs of dealing with applications.  In the context of reform around e-planning and the submission of online applications and appeals, we need to reflect on the real costs to the system but it is important that a portion of any fees that will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of an application under the strategic housing initiative, will be released to the local authorities to cover the costs they would have incurred in engaging with, supporting and assessing the application during both the pre-application and in its formal assessment of any submissions received and in making its report to the board as part of its decision making.  If a local authority can demonstrate that it spend X amount of time and resources to deal with that, it should be entitled to a portion of the costs from the fees that a developer would pay.  <br\/><br\/>As Senator Boyhan is not present, I will deal with the points he raised when he returns.  On the question of ready to go sites raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I will pass to Mr. Niall Cussen who may have more information, but I can give general information.  There were 18 applications in the course of 2016.  We have the information on a spread sheet and we are happy to share that with committee members who can look at the timelines and dates.  As Mr. Cussen said, we took a snapshot from 2016, reflecting the most recent activity.  If members would like further information from previous years, we will look at that, recognising that the figures would be fewer and fewer as one goes back when there was not a significant level of planning activity. <br\/><br\/>On the issue of requests for further information, Mr. Niall Cussen will be able to address that issue.  It is recognised that it arises from a combination and not just from one issue, whether it is developers who might not be providing the right level of information or, it might be, as reflected in our presentation, that local authorities are assigning conditions, where in many cases the conditions might be too detailed or excessive and when appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la it may have considered and reduced some of those conditions.  It is probably a combination of that but Mr. Cussen has some further information on that issue.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the 10% loan charge, it is the last 10% to 15% of the funding that tends to be the higher cost.  Of those who have been able to secure planning permission on zoned land, they are still paying for that last bit and it is the final amount of a high value and potentially high risk funding that tends be transferred into the costs, but Mr. Cussen might be able to elaborate on some of those issues.<br\/><br\/>The ability of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make detailed assessment through the pre-application consultation is the reason we have structured the nine week mandatory period, putting the local authorities which has all that information central, both in terms of engaging with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and with the developer but also in providing a report to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as to whether what is proposed fits with the regional plans, the developments plans and the local area plans and also aligns with the investment programmes in respect of local road and water services.  As<b><\/b>Deputy &Oacute; Broin rightly points out that information is crucial to assessing the viability of a project.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authority feel the project is premature in terms of putting it forward, that is a key consideration and will determine in the first instance whether An Bord Plean&aacute;la will accept the application or whether it will say that it will not accept the application because the applicant has not met what are seen as minimum criteria.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la itself will have expertise and can have many of its planners and administrators have worked for the local authority so they understand the process but that is not to dismiss or undermine what will be a key role for the local planning process which has an expertise.<br\/><br\/>In terms of third party inputs, the issue is two-fold.  There will be an opportunity for all interested parties to make their submissions just as they can in relation to any applications, but maybe more crucially, and what has been factored in asMr. Terry Sheridan has outlined, beyond the initial five week period of the 16 weeks, the local authority has three weeks to make its own submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as to whether a proposal is correct and in that instance the local authority can access and assess, having regard to local comments that have been made, so not only is the local authority making a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on its own views but it can also take account of local members and can also assess whether these are subjective or more fundamental issues associated with it.  I will leave the question of environmental impact assessment screening to Mr. Sheridan to deal with.<br\/><br\/>There are three planning elements in this Bill.  There is first, An Bord Plean&aacute;la fast track planning, the separate issue of environment impact assessment pre screening process, which we are bringing in to try to facilitate a quicker and more efficient system to deal with issues such as flood relief works, where under EU law there is a requirement to assess whether any project has an environmental impact or a habitats impact and make an appropriate assessment.  Within the Irish system if the projects are below a certain threshold they are exempt from planning but they are not exempt from a screening process.  By actually bringing in a separate screening process to a planning application, a local authority can assess whether an application does or does not have significant impacts.  If it states it does not have then the exempted thresholds apply and a local authority can go and do some works.  There is a twofold benefit to this.  By confirming and ensuring we are fully compliant with EU law by providing for this screening process, but a screening process that meets the requirements will also enable us to look at the exempted development regulations and the thresholds that currently apply and for the likes of flooding works it is quite a low threshold.  lf one can demonstrate there is a system that assesses, whether it is an environment impact assessment requirement or not, then one can raise thresholds in the regulations so that one could allow more not to have to go through the formal planning process.  That is a requirement.<br\/><br\/>If I have not covered all the points, Mr. Terry Sheridan can touch on them.  On the question of the Minister's additional powers, I think many of them to relate to regulations and the process as to how the system will work and would be quite standard in terms of other procedures and administrative aspects of the work itself.<br\/><br\/>The third element of the planning that we have not touched on but I think Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised it was the timelines in regard to the Part 8 process.  In summary terms and again we can go through it in more detail, there is an initial six weeks process for a public consultation.  It is currently eight weeks.  Once a proposal for a local authority's own development, including for houses for social housing or any other housing on local authority lands, there will be an initial six week period, then there is a process which is a manager's report and that has to happen in eight weeks.  Under the current system, there is no time limit on a chief executive presenting a report to the elected members.  We are setting an eight week time period, that the chief executive has to deliver that to the elected members to consider.  The elected members then have six weeks in which to consider whether they accept, reject or vary the proposal.  The end stop of that 20 week period is that where the elected members fail to make a resolution on the issue, the chief executive's report is deemed to be accepted.  It is a 20 week period for the three phases and that is the maximum period.<br\/><br\/>I see that Senator Boyhan has returned.  I might leave it to Mr. Niall Cussen to deal with the levies.  I acknowledge that levies are adopted by the elected members so it may be a matter to look at the scale of them that may be more cogent to colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown itself.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of democracy and engagement with the local council, I had outlined previously the system where an individual, a local authority can fully engage.  The local authority will have full powers and controls in relation to zoning in terms of local area plans, LAPs and its decisions as to where it sees land appropriate for housing and at certain scales and at certain densities.  Applications under this process will only occur within lands that have been zoned and within the parameters and objectives of the development plan or local area plan.<\/p><p>We feel that full accountability for and control of that process remains in the local area.  The process for a third party to make submissions is fully enshrined.  The local authority in making its own submission can take account of any submissions that have been presented.<\/p><p> Senator Boyhan asked about the appeals process.  The evidence we tried to present in our initial presentation outlines that in many cases the outcome of a decision or an appeal is broadly the same in many instances, perhaps with the exception of a reduction or a slight tweak to some of the conditions.  The question is whether the system can be made more efficient by having that engagement and ensuring there is that discussion between the local authority, the board and the developer with the right information.<\/p><p> We are trying to shorten the process and make it more efficient.  Bringing the board into it provides an opportunity for a greater consistency of application and consideration, but that is not to say that each of the 31 local authorities would make decisions themselves.  We feel this is the right balance given the urgency to deliver on the huge number of sites.  The Senator makes a very valid point in the context of the lands that are zoned and have planning permission.  As I said at the start, this is not the silver bullet that will fix everything in the planning system.<\/p><p> What we are doing elsewhere in pillar 3 and across the five pillars of the action plan is focused on looking at the cost associated with development, releasing and accessing lands through infrastructure provision, looking at making better use of mixed-tenure developments where a local authority and private AHBs may together develop a better integrated project, and engaging with NAMA over lands that are currently tied up.  We hope that all of these together will help to release some of those lands that have potential and planning permissions but are not reaching the market for a range of reasons.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned some broader issues outside the Bill relating to consolidation of the planning Act and the planning regulator.  It goes back to the point raised by the institute about the root-and-branch review.  The Bill deals with fairly tight issues.  Starting a consolidation of the planning Act is not an easy process, but we have tried to make it as simple and accessible as possible by having a formal-informal consolidation, so to speak, that the Law Reform Commission has actually done - it is on our website.  Any amendments made to the planning Act or the planning regulations are integrated into a master document.  While it might not formally recognise a consolidation or a simplification of the planning Act, we have tried to make it as accessible as possible through the Department's website.<\/p><p> The planning regulator is obviously a key element of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill which is on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  That primarily relates to the Mahon tribunal recommendations and the establishment of the office of the planning regulator.  As part of any root-and-branch review that will happen early next year, it will take account of the functions the Department, the board, the planning regulator and the local authorities should have.<\/p><p> Deputy Casey asked about the nine weeks and the consultation.  He might have slightly mixed up the EIA for the screening process and what happens within the nine-week period.  The nine-week statutory period will involve an assessment of whether a project needs an EIA.  That will be determined in consultation with the board and the local authority.  So both sides will be able to determine if it is of a scale or a far bigger project.  If it is an EIA, it would not even be ready for submission to the board until the EIS has been prepared and further analysis done.  It almost kicks a project back.  If it is for EIS, it will not actually be ready to go into the system and that is where the pre-consultation is so vital.<\/p><p> As I mentioned the fees are covered in the regulations, so there is no reference to the issues there.<\/p><p> I will let Mr. Cussen deal with some of the items, followed by Mr. Sheridan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the committee members for their good questions.  Senator Boyhan's point about the Dublin housing supply and co-ordination task force is valid.  It is important for the work of the Department that we have a survey of lands that are available for development, have planning permission and so on.  The report he mentioned concluded that approximately 26,000 homes in the Dublin area have the benefit of planning permission and a further 20,000 homes worth of land is infrastructurally unconstrained and available for development after that.  It is important to remember in whose hands those lands lie in terms of being capable of having development carried out, not being financially impaired, etc.<\/p> <p>  From the analysis we carried out, it is notable that many of the extant permissions are quite old permissions and very often subject to extensions of duration.  They are coming to the end of their lives.  Our legislation is borne of the following question.  Having been through a development plan process that identified lands as being suitable for residential development in principle in the first place, that taking two years, very often local area plans fleshing out that broad principle in a lot of detail in terms of where the open space is, how the access will be provide, etc., taking a year or 18 months on top of that, as well as the previous permissions on that site, etc., will we still have a process that takes a year, 18 months or longer to effectively refresh or renew those permissions, having been through a load of detail already?<\/p> <p>  This is a point that comes back very clearly from the industry in terms of the need to continually refresh the permissions and ensure they are attuned to the requirements of the housing market and people who need homes.  There are all sorts of changes in terms of design, etc.  The planning process at the moment does not distinguish between that and any other planning application - one is back to square 1.  We are in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis.  We were obviously keen to see if there was a mechanism whereby we could speed up that process of renewing those permissions and ensuring they were in tune with current requirements and so on.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made a very good point about Kilternan-Glenamuck.  We are acutely aware of the very significant tranche of land available there.  He is correct in his calculations of the cumulative impact of the development contributions.  The implication of that for the viability of development is plain for all to see, particularly in the context of Central Bank macro-prudential lending rules and what most typical households can afford.  As Mr. David Walsh pointed out, this is a function of the elected members in the context of the preparation and adoption of those development-contribution schemes.<\/p> <p>  In this particular one the development contributions are so high, particularly relating to the roads and other elements, because in effect the local authority has had to factor in a very significant amount of land acquisition cost in the context of putting together estimates for the provision of the infrastructure.  Obviously the cost of developing distributor roads and so forth runs to more than the cost of the concrete and tarmac, and also incorporates the cost of the land on which the infrastructure sits.  As the Senator well knows that is probably one of the most valuable areas of real estate in the country.<\/p> <p>  I reassure the committee that this is an issue of which the local authorities and the Department are acutely aware.  It is being worked on with the landowners in the context of an alternate arrangement.  Rather than the circular arrangement of having a very large contribution which collects a whole load of money, which pays for compulsory acquisition of land which goes back to the developers, could we not have a far simpler system whereby, in effect, the land is proffered at a very low cost or nominal cost and obviously the reduction that would enable would be reflected in terms of the development contribution and so on?<\/p> <p>  However, there are a number of technical issues relating to the development of that land, the relocation of a 220 kV overhead power line, the development of the stricture road effectively sitting in the footprint of that power line, old landfill and other issues that have to be dealt with in that context in terms of excavations and so on.  That is a very active area of investigation and assessment, involving the housing delivery office, the local authority, etc., as well as EirGrid and ESB Networks.<\/p><p>I hope we will get a breakthrough on that shortly because it is a key block of land and progressing it is very important.  Land cost is the main reason the contribution is so high but developers are now engaged in finding an alternative way to deal with it.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Walsh dealt with some of the other questions, including those related to the interest cost.  When the conventional pillar banks are not in a position to lend to developers to acquire sites which do not have planning permission, developers have to have recourse to mezzanine or senior debt funders who have a much higher rate of interest than providers of pure development finance.  Housing providers on the ground emphasise that, once a site is acquired, the meter is running on the interest cost.<br\/><br\/>A question was asked about our data on ready-to-go sites.  Members will be familiar with <i>Myplan.ie<\/i>and the Dublin housing task force site viewer, which has a comprehensive database of all lands that are zoned for development, have planning permission or are active and waiting a response.  We do not constantly monitor sites which are going for sale but we monitor broad trends on site sales in the commercial press.  In the loan portfolio sales we are seeing an increasing supply of sites and strategic development zones, STZs, moving into new ownership.<br\/><br\/>Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked a very good question about research into requests for further information.  We maintain a constant overview of general patterns and trends in local authorities and are constantly looking at cases which come to our attention in the course of our interaction with local authorities.  I am a professional planner and I maintain constant contact with all my colleagues in the Dublin local authorities and across the country.  Getting everybody around the table, not just planners and architects but roads people, parks people, Irish Water people and all the various players, can be challenging but it is crucial for getting a comprehensive picture of the factors that will be taken into account in the determination of a planning application.  Some of those challenges are not met as effectively as they should be and there is a subliminal sense that where one has the facility to deal with or to clarify a request for further information, the application can be let go and we can get the views of the public.  However, most large applications go through the clarification of further information process, and there are some very interesting dates among the 15 or 18 cases the board has brought to our attention in 2016.  These are not only single requests but multiples and if all this transpires in the course of a planning application it begs the question of what the preplanning application process and the consultation process were about.  The discipline inherent in the board having to make a straight decision to grant or refuse forces a big focus, early in the preapplication process, on getting all the stakeholders around the table to ascertain the parameters that will be important in the context of the determination of the application.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy also asked a question about research into or evidence regarding preapplication consultation requests.  We have issued two circulars in the past couple of years, particularly in the context of the Dublin housing task force, in which we emphasised that we would like to see preapplication consultation requests turned around within a fortnight.  Despite the circulars, we are constantly getting feedback from practitioners and others who prepare planning applications, such as architects, engineers, planners etc., that many local authorities are struggling to achieve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Is that a staffing issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#J00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>We are strengthening the staffing of local authorities as part of the broader action plan on housing and other measures and we have approved some 600 posts for a wide range of professional and administrative positions.

The board has long had the strength and capacity to handle large planning applications.  It used to have a large housing projects team and, given the fact that the vast majority of large housing applications take place in Dublin, there is strong merit in creating such a dedicated team within the board for this purpose.  It would know the whole area of housing policy and, rather than be fragmented across four local authorities in the Dublin area and eight in the wider Dublin area, it would have a singular focus on getting high-quality developments in good locations and would ensure a high-quality environment for the people who are most important in all of this, namely, the people who live there.

There is also a need for the public to have a transparent system.  In Tipperary it is very difficult to get a preplanning meeting.  The system has tightened and tightened and tightened and the role of the public representative has been completely diminished.  It is not that they wanted to interfere but they were a conduit for the public.  They are, after all, public representatives and they used to tease out the issues over public consultations and give advice.  Our county has now decided to stop on-site planning meetings involving public representatives and a client for one-off houses, which have an important role to play in dealing with the housing crisis, though we are not dealing with them today.<\/p> <p>  We have to do something but there is a number of housing estates in Tipperary which are bombsites.  They have just been left there, with people living in darkness and in dangerous conditions.  Planning was applied for and given but there has been no enforcement and planners say they can do nothing about it.<\/p><p>It is hell on earth for people.  They are facing the winter with no lights or footpaths, and there are holes and dangerous objects.  They are living in fear, especially with no lighting.  While this matter must be dealt with, I just wonder whether local authorities have the will and way to deal with it.<\/p><p> Reference has been made to the charges.  The excessive charges are a cash cow for county councils.  They must be examined.  They might have been okay in the boom, if they were ever okay.  For a private individual or builder building a house, the costs associated with charges, VAT and fees are nearly half the cost of the building.  We cannot address the matter without considering this.  I realise the Department is doing its best but a lot of soul searching must be done because we have failed miserably. I am talking about my county, a rural county.  If we are to fast-track planning, will we have worse circumstances and outcomes, with the public having no say?<\/p><p> EirGrid was mentioned.

This is an important engagement this morning.  We all acknowledge there is a housing crisis.  From the outset, we need to ensure we keep intact the integrity of the planning process.  I do not doubt but that the new legislation achieves that.  The officials might clarify where the integrity is defined in terms of the new legislation.  It is important for public representatives and the wider citizenry to have confidence in our planning system.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge this is reactionary legislation due to the times we live in.  The delegates might comment on some of the proactive planning envisaged.  I acknowledge this is a matter for another day but they might comment on it in light of the new national development plan.  Mr. Cussen stated the demand is essentially in Dublin and that he expects the large schemes to be rolled out mainly in Dublin.  Fundamentally, that is the problem.  Dublin is like a vortex for economic activity and, by extension, demand.  We do not often see the term \"balanced regional development\".  This term implies the spreading of economic activity across the country to areas that have capacity but which, unfortunately, do not have either the infrastructure or economic activity required to house many of the people we are currently trying to house.  The officials might refer to that in their comments.  There are many planners present.  Until we have the wider holistic view, we will be revisiting this problem in another cycle.  The officials might mention in their response that we need a more proactive planning vision for the country.  That requires the necessary tools, not only for the policy makers but also for local authorities so they can provide capacity so housing and economic activity can happen in the regions.  This would remove some of the considerable pressure in places such as Dublin.<\/p> <p>  I recognise this legislation is just one lever or tool in responding to the crisis we currently face.  The Minister has no option but to examine all options for alleviating the pressure on housing.  Planning is obviously one area he must examine.  He must also account for viability, land use, etc.<\/p> <p>  The whole planning process must be taken into account.  I take account of what Senator Boyhan said about the Dublin task force on assessing the existing planning applications.  Could this be clarified?  Some are quite old and may not be viable for one reason or another, be it due to levies, house design, house type or other factors.  Could the witnesses respond on that?  Is it likely that many will be reviewed under a new process?  That is an important point to clarify.<\/p> <p>  Some people talk about the democratic deficit.  For any councillor elected, it is when making a local area plan or county development plan or zoning land that democratic accountability should feature.  Many of us were councillors.  Could the delegates reaffirm that accountability still remains in the process?  I believe they will confirm it but it needs to be reinforced in their response.<\/p> <p>  Could the delegates clarify that any large-scale housing project with over 100 units or any project for student accommodation will not be applied for in any place that is not accommodated under a local area plan or county development plan?  Could they clarify that the local authority members will still have the final say on where future development will happen, and on its scale and density?<\/p> <p>  I am happy to see a defined timeline or sunset clause in the legislation.  The final date is in December 2019.  The Minister has flexibility to extend the period for two years.  That is appropriate in the times we live in.  Could the delegates confirm that when the time comes, be it December 2019 or two years later, at which time I hope the crisis will have passed, the legislation will dissolve and that we will then refer back to the existing position?<\/p> <p>  I wish to make some points on my experience of the planning process.  The Irish Planning Institute has given views from the perspective of planners but there are sometimes conflicting views among planners.  I have often noted frustrations emerge when local authority planners held one view and private planners held an opposite one.  Ultimately, planners will decide in any case because An Bord Plean&aacute;la will hire them.  The board will have the overall say in terms of recommending a decision.<\/p> <p>  The current frustration is over the delays in the local authority system, be it because of resources or other factors.  One must be fair to local authorities because they were denuded of considerable expertise and staff over recent years.  We need to recognise that as a committee.  Many planners resigned or retired within the local authority system.  Much experience has been lost.  The consequence is that there are now many delays in having preplanning meetings.  As I stated, there is frustration over a lack of consistency.  The IPI made the good point that if a planner is appointed for a large-scale scheme, that planner should stay with it almost from the preplanning stage to the making of a decision.  This is not currently the case.  I and, I am sure, many members have seen cases in which the planner who deals with a proposal initially moves on in a couple of months, with his replacement possibly taking a completely different view.  The new process might address that and result in more consistency in having dedicated personnel to deal with large-scale applications.  The delegation might clarify whether this will be the case.<\/p> <p>  My other concern is on the appeals process.  It is important that the officials clarify whether there is a concern.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la ultimately arrives at a decision, where is the right of appeal and who does it go to?  Is it another body or somebody within the board?  Where is the integrity within that process?  It is important that this be addressed if it is not already addressed.<\/p> <p>  The flood relief measures in this legislation have not been spoken about.  I have been working on this for a number of years.  I refer to where lands have been damaged or flooded and the planning obligations regarding obtaining the consents, involving the officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, heritage officials, the local authorities and many others.  It takes months for somebody who wants to repair a river bank to deal with waste permits and planning legislation and land is literally destroyed.  We need a streamlined system whereby there can be an urgent response, not only to the OPW but, by extension, landowners, be it through the local authority or advice.  Immediate consent should be given to them for the repair of land banks where flooding has occurred.  I have seen land-holdings wiped out.  Landowners are hamstrung.  They cannot respond because they do not have the consents in place.  Local authority officials are frustrated also.  Could the officials clarify whether this legislation will address that problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#K00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>This Bill contains some very welcome proposals.

It is very important that it be included in the legislation - it is the recommendation of the Housing Agency - that the Department have a policy on the management of local authority homes which are empty.  If 1,000 of the 36,000 homes in Dublin which are empty could be brought back onto the market, it would make a significant difference.  Do the delegates have a view on this?<\/p> <p>  I accept and acknowledge the importance of fast-tracking planning permission, but my difficulty is that land which has already been zoned in the greater Dublin area is not being built on.  Extending the period of planning permission for this land when it is capable of being developed now does not make sense.  Perhaps I have a different view from that of others sitting at the table, but I am concerned that a significant number of players who exploited the last boom will exploit the housing crisis by holding onto and not building on land on which they have planning permission to build.  I am very cautious about extending planning permissions without very good cause.  However, I have no problem with fast-tracking planning applications, as proposed.  It is a very important proposal.<\/p> <p>  I do not see it in the legislation and do not know whether it is included, but, whatever view we hold on the first-time buyer's grant, a very simple way to assist first-time purchasers is through the use of local authority land banks.  Local authorities have a lot of land.  I do not have the data to hand, but I know that they possess thousands of acres of land throughout the country which is suitable for development, but they do not have the funds to do so.  Would it be germane to the Bill to provide an opportunity for local authorities which have identified land suitable for social housing to enter into public private partnerships to develop it?  Such houses could be sold at a very reasonable cost because the land is already owned by the State.  If local authorities were to enter into a public private partnership with a developer, the price of land could be controlled and we would get houses at a basic cost in central areas in towns and cities.

It is a five year process before one can apply to have a housing estate taken in charge.  The local authority must take it on and will have ongoing electricity and maintenance bills.  Whether this is included in regulations, it should be changed.  Every local authority should automatically be given the full amount required for the upkeep of all the estates they take in charge.  Can the legislation be changed to ensure this?<\/p> <p>  The Bill will only affect certain areas in bigger cities and towns.

All such measures are welcome.  An area in which further measures could be taken is the compliance process.  It has long been recognised that there is a need to have a time-bound compliance process.  At present it is not time-bound, which creates considerable difficulties when it comes to undertaking development.  This leads to delays in the post-planning permission stage.  Perhaps the opportunity could be taken in this legislation to put such a process in place.<\/p><p>There are other elements that can be fine-tuned or further developed within this proposed legislation to further achieve reductions in timescale and risk.  For example, Mr. Cussen referred to delays and I certainly concur with his comments about the pre-application stage with local authorities.  Again, the opportunity should be taken, we suggest, to put in place a statutory timescale for the local authority pre-application stage, which is the precursor to engaging with the board.  It may fall at the first hurdle if significant delays remain, which is the case with some local authorities.  The next stage of the process is the validation of an application following the pre-application process.  Rather than being sent back to the beginning of the process if there is some shortage of information at that stage, provision should be made for the board to request the missing information from the applicant and keep going without starting again.  That is trying to avoid the snake back to the beginning.<\/p><p> Another potential snake is if the board, having gone through the whole process, considers in making a decision that there is an absence of information.  If information is missing or if changes in design and layout are required for it to be acceptable, the board should have a specific power to request that information or design changes.  Any developer or applicant would much rather get a request for further information from the board than a refusal and a return to the very beginning of the process.  I have no doubt the board would use such a power with discretion and only where it is really necessary.  That can be addressed by practice guidelines.<\/p><p> There are two other points.  Again, an opportunity should be taken to address the issue of amendment applications.  Most large-scale housing applications are subject to subsequent amendment applications relating to house types and aspects of layout and design.  The legislation makes no specific provision for that.  The question arises in the case of an amendment to a permission granted by the board of more 100 units as to whether the amendment application goes to the board or back to the local authority.  I suggest it should go to the local authority but that should be explicitly addressed, with specific power to make amendment applications provided for in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spain","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions, the bullet point No. 1.6 refers to our own research involving a survey of members over the summer.

I understand the committee received a copy of our submission in advance and a copy of our pre-budget submission.  I will take this opportunity to make a couple of points.<\/p> <p>  Threshold is a national housing charity that solves housing problems and prevents homelessness.  We have regional advice centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and we provide a front-line service to over 32,000 people annually, primarily but not exclusively in the private rented sector.  Many of our clients are paying a very severe price for the current housing shortage, principally due to rising rents, being forced to accept unsuitable housing and living in constant fear of losing their homes.  With regard to the committee's previous discussion, anything that works effectively to secure a greater number of homes and social homes in particular through the Part V process must be seriously considered.  Improvements to the planning system that will benefit our clients would be welcomed by us.<\/p> <p>  Most of our comments today will focus on heads 25 to 30 of the draft Bill, which deal with changes to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended, and changes to improve the functioning of the Residential Tenancies Board.  We have some comments on student accommodation as well.  Our position is that whereas we recognise the proposed measures bring some level of relief to the sector - which is in crisis and the action is welcome as such - the measures do not go far enough and should be expanded to protect many more vulnerable people who stand at risk of losing their homes.  The rise in market rents generally continues to outpace inflation and it will not be long before the protection that was offered by the temporary two-year pause in rent reviews and even the recent rise in rent supplement limits will lose effect.  It is urgent that a more permanent and balanced approach to regulating rent increases in particular be put in place.<\/p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland, the national housing strategy, is incomplete as yet and does not contain measures to reform the private rented sector.  We must have a national strategy for the private rented sector that is adequately resourced with clear targets to address issues like long-term rent certainty, increased affordable supply, improving the quality of rented housing, promoting institutional investment and dealing with the difficulties in the buy-to-let sector.  It is more than 15 years since we had the last strategic review of the private rented sector.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the individual heads.  Head 25 deals with the continuation of tenancy upon the sale of rented property.  The number of rented households facing loss of homes due to the proposed sale of a property by a landlord, lending agent or an investment fund is of particular concern.  As many members know, Threshold recently provided on-site advice and support to tenants facing mass eviction in Tyrrelstown in north-west Dublin; that issue led to the proposed change to section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  This is set to become an even more serious problem over the next number of years as a significant number of distressed mortgage properties have been purchased by non-bank entities such as large investment funds, which have a business model of selling these investments within three to five years.<\/p> <p>  There are 47,402 mortgage accounts held by non-bank entities and a total of 19,701 mortgages in arrears held by non-bank entities.  We welcome the announcement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, that he intends to introduce measures in the finance Bill to target vulture funds and introduce restrictions to prevent them from designating profits and paying little or no tax on them.  Legal safeguards must be put in place to give residential tenants similar rights to the tenants of commercial properties who remain unaffected by the sale of those properties.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the proposed legislative change that protects tenants to some extent in cases where 20 or more units in a development are being sold in a six-month period.  The proposed change provides that a tenancy should not be terminated but at the same time the proposed protection is too narrow.  For example, it does not apply where a landlord can show that the price to be obtained by selling the dwelling is more than 20% below what could be obtained with vacant possession.  If enacted, the legislation must be drafted in a manner that ensures the requirement is robust and subject to rigorous proof, as we believe the provision could be open to widespread abuse.  The provision applies where 20 or more units are being sold.  This stipulation would exclude a great majority of cases where protection is needed.  Our view is that the sale of any rented property should not lead to the termination of a tenancy.  Section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act should be reviewed to remove sale as a justification for the termination of a tenancy in any case where the property is in the ownership of an institutional landlord or where the landlord in question works as a property professional and owns, for example, in excess of three properties.<\/p><p> The extent of vacant properties in Ireland has been brought into sharp view recently and it is in clear contrast to the severe shortage of properties to rent as indicated by the Daft rental index.  Where vacant possession is obtained for sale purposes and receivers are appointed to properties Threshold's experience has been that these properties have been left unoccupied for a considerable period of time and are adding to the number of vacant properties in Ireland.  Failing that, we would suggest at the very least that the requirement that a notice of termination be given only after the sale of a property has been agreed rather than the simple production of a declaration of intent to sale which, at the moment, is grounds under section 34 for the vacation of a property.<\/p><p> We would very much like to see the current legislation introduce an additional amendment to deal with the situation of repossessions and receiverships.  Threshold believes there is a very significant opportunity in this legislation to amend the Residential Tenancies Act to extend the definition of landlord to include receivers and lenders in relation to the repossession of property.  There is no doubt that a change in the law is required to protect tenants in cases where their landlord's property is being repossessed or where a receiver is appointed to un-mortgaged properties.  Due to a legal loophole in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, lenders or receivers may seek to summarily evict a tenant without giving them the notice required under law.  In some extreme cases tenants come home to find their locks changed, effectively making them homeless.  Receivers also may refuse to carry out repairs and ask the tenant to pursue their former landlord for the return of the rental deposit.  A tenant should not lose his or her basic rights because the landlord is in financial difficulties.  We are also seeking the introduction of a code of conduct on buy to let mortgage arrears which would introduce a transparent process for financial institutions, landlords and tenants and set out the required steps for engagement with landlords and tenants, along with forms of communications and ensure that financial institutions respect and uphold tenants' rights, which they currently do not do.<\/p><p> In my presentation I have set out the extent of the difficulties that our clients are experiencing, as illustrated by recent Central Bank figures.  There is no question or doubt, looking at the number of buy to let mortgages in arrears of over 720 days, that the issue of receiverships being appointed to buy-to-let properties, and those properties effectively being left vacant and tenants being put out of those properties, is something that must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  We are asking the committee to use this legislation as a way to introduce protections for tenants in situations where receivers are appointed to properties.<\/p><p> Head 26 deals with the repeal of section 42 of the Residential Tenancies Act, where a landlord can terminate a further part 4 tenancy without reason during the first six months of the tenancy.  The removal of this provision is a positive measure but we do have concerns in that the further part 4 tenancy may be treated as a new tenancy which would allow a landlord to sidestep the current protections in regard to rent increases.  We would like the provision to be changed to ensure that does not happen.   It is our view that tenants at the moment have insufficient security of tenure.  We believe tenants should have indefinite security of tenure.  While the removal of the provision is welcome, it does not go far enough to clarify the situation, as things stand at the moment, in relation to security of tenure.<\/p><p> Head 27 amends section 100 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  It provides for a reduction in the time-frame for the submission of appeals against a determination of an adjudicator, from 21 days to ten days.  Threshold urges caution in respect of this amendment.  From our own experience, by the time one of our clients receives a determination which is unfavourable, contacts us, discusses the options and lodges an appeal, a ten day time frame may be very challenging.  These are tenants who are getting the benefit of expert advocacy and advice from an expert organisation.  There are many tenants out there who are vulnerable and who are not getting that type of advocacy and advice.  Even though there are provisions to allow the board to extend the appeal period, Threshold believes that the ten day time frame is too tight.  Currently there is no strategic framework for planning, monitoring and funding housing advice and advocacy services.  There is plenty of evidence that tenants are not aware of their rights.  Threshold believes that there needs to be a dedicated funding mechanism to address this as a matter of urgency as there is significant human suffering to many, many tenants.  It should be acknowledged that one in five Irish families in the State are living in private rented housing.  We ask the Government to put in place a national awareness campaign to ensure that tenants are made aware of their rights.<\/p><p> Head 28 is an amendment of section 103 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which provides for the holding of one-person tribunals to assist in speeding up the process.  If one looks at the level of disputes that come before the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, we contend that if more time went into the setting up of the deposit protection scheme - which was a commitment of the 2015 legislation - it would have a major effect in freeing up the capacity of the RTB to hear more cases.  While Threshold does not believe it would necessarily be an issue, one-person tribunals in cases that can be quite significant to the individuals concerned such as in issues of rent arrears, could lead to situations of bias.  For the record, Threshold dealt with 969 cases last year where tenants had difficulty in getting their deposit back from the landlord.  The failure to return deposits can place a tenant at risk of homelessness.  Threshold agrees that the implementation of the deposit protection scheme in Ireland is something that should be introduced as a matter of urgency and should be a priority for Government.<\/p><p> Head 29 is the amendment of section 121.  Threshold sees that this measure will improve the processing times for dispute resolution with the RTB.  We are in agreement with the amendment.  Head 30, amending section 124 of the Residential tenancies Act, has the effect of allowing the District Court to make an order for possession.  The effect of this amendment will be to speed up the process of securing the vacation of dwellings and will have a significant impact on the number of tenants who are at risk of homelessness.  In response, Threshold believes that a protocol should be developed between the RTB and the relevant local authorities so that a local authority is alerted where an over-holding case is identified as a bona fide inability to secure alternative accommodation as a source of the dispute.  The local authorities should have to assume an obligation to source alternative suitable accommodation either in the private rented sector or in a relevant social housing unit if the person qualifies for social housing, within a specified time frame, through its fast-track accommodation finding service.  Such a service could be run in conjunction with the community and voluntary sector and possibly as an extension of Threshold's tenancy protection service.  The fact of the matter is that many tenants are over-holding because they cannot find somewhere else to live.  That is the reality of the situation.<\/p><p> Section 32, amends the Housing Finance Agencies Act 1981 to provide the Housing Finance Agency with the opportunity to lend to higher education institutions for the purposes of the provision of student accommodation.  We think this is an important change.  At the moment there are SOME 24,000 students who are renting from private landlords.  In the main this accommodation is entirely unsuitable.  The style of renting in the private rental sector is not usually suitable for students.  There are only about 3,000 purpose-built student accommodation units.  Ireland is looking at an increase in student numbers of about 20,000 over the next number of years and therefore it is critically important that third level institutions not only have an ability but a duty to provide third level education accommodation.  We would like to see a condition in relation to affordability being introduced.   Where State moneys are being made available it is very important that the type of accommodation being provided is affordable for students.  As an organisation, Threshold has seen instances where on-campus accommodation has been subjected to significant rent increases over short periods of time , making it unaffordable.  If students cannot access accommodation, for many of them they cannot access an education.  Where campus extensions are being agreed Threshold would like to see the planning code changed to oblige third level educational institutions to provide for additional student accommodation also.  I thank the committee for having us here today.  My colleague Mr. Diarmaid O'Sullivan and I are happy to answer any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Hayden for her presentation.  I would like to put on the record the particularly effective work done by Threshold in the tenancy sustainment programme.  I deal with Laurence Kinch a lot and the service is making a huge difference to a very significant number of people's lives.  It is important that we acknowledge that.  I have questions on this section for Threshold and for the Department.  I will go through them by each head and people can respond as appropriate.  For clarification on heads 22 and 23 with regard to the leased approved housing bodies' properties, could the Department give the committee more information as to why that is necessary?  Is it just the case that they are not covered under the Residential Tenancies Act currently because they are leased properties or is there some other reason?  I would be interested to know.<\/p><p>Is it just a case they are not covered under the RTA currently because they are leased properties or is there some other reason?  I would be interested to know that.<\/p><p> The big concern many of us have with head 25, which is the substantive piece of this part of the Bill, is with the figure of 20.  If I understand the head right, it means that somebody cannot serve notices to quit on 20 properties within a six-month period but they could serve notice to quit on 19, 18, or 17 of those within the six-month period and then the rest after that.  The Department believes this is an appropriate number.  Is there research to back that up?  On what basis did the Department reach that number?  Can it give us more information?  The Department also argues that to go for developments of more than 20 units would lead to market distortion.  Part of the difficulty is that the market is already very distorted.  I find it hard to see how allowing for larger unit developments would be a problem.  Will the Department give us more information on that?<\/p><p> The vast majority of people at risk of homelessness as a result of repossession and being served with notices to quit are in properties where the landlord owns a single unit or has a small number of properties.  There is also a situation where in defined geographical areas, a bank will repossess multiple properties, sometimes in the region of 20 or more, and will serve notices to quit.  They could be all in a number of housing estates in close proximity.  The geographical impact of those notices to quit will be identical if they are spread over a relatively confined geographical area as they would be in a multiple unit development.  Was any consideration given to that and, if not, why not?  <\/p><p> My next point was referenced by Dr. Aideen Hayden and it is the point that Deputy Fergus O'Dowd wanted to raise.  I am very concerned that subhead 2 of head 25 will not apply in circumstances where the landlord can show that the price to be obtained by selling the dwelling subject to an existing tenancy is more than 20% below that which could be obtained with vacant possession.  What is the rationale for that?  On what basis were those figures picked?  My real concern here is that while this would be a welcome a development for people living in a Tyrrelstown situation, they represent a tiny number of the people who are now being made homeless as a result of notices to quit on the basis of vacant possession orders.  I am keen to understand that properly.<\/p><p> Do I understand head 26 correctly that the intention of this change is to end probationary tenancies after the first tier part 4 tenancy so there is no probationary tenancy in the first six months of year five of the tenancy?  One of the issues that has arisen following the incorporation of approved housing bodies into the Residential Tenancies Act is whether somebody who has been a long-term tenant of a voluntary housing association and has now been given their first part 4 tenancy is subject to any undermining of their rights during that six-month probationary period.  There are a couple of cases going to the RTB in the next couple of weeks which will test that for the first time.  Was there any consideration given to retrospectively applying this change to somebody who is already a long-term tenant, in some cases up to four years in an approved housing body, but all of a sudden is now in a six-month probationary period under this section?  What about those people who are stuck on year-to-year tenancies who have never been given a full part 4 tenancy and therefore cannot avail of some of those protections?<\/p><p> On heads 27, 28 and 30, I would like the Department to respond to the specific issues that Dr. Aideen Hayden raised in terms of the concerns because I share them.<\/p><p> On the issue of student accommodation, these loans will still go on the Government balance sheet in terms of impact on the debt because they are Government guaranteed loans.  The witnesses should correct me if I am wrong.  If I am not wrong, what is the prospect of significant lending?  Also, if I am wrong, what is the expectation in terms of the level of lending that might be provided?  This is a very good measure if it results in significant increased investment in student accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#N00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>We are under pressure with time.

On the question of 20 as a number, we do not believe in it.  Our view on it is that where institutional investors are involved we do not care whether the number is 20, 19, 18 or 17 or 1.  The bottom line is they are institutional investors and we want to see those properties sold with the tenancy intact.  On receiverships and the point that was made about banks having their property scattered in an area, the question arises of what is defined as a geographic area.<\/p><p>In my opinion, it can be a portfolio held by a bank.

The property should be sold and, in an ideal world, with the tenancy intact.  The issue of buy-to-let receiverships is significant.  One issue of concern is that local authorities and voluntary housing bodies have a mandate from the Government to purchase properties on the open market.  They are restricted to only buying properties where there is vacant possession.  Obviously, this excludes them from buying properties in receivership where a tenancy is <i>in situ<\/i>because the purchased property is supposed to be made available to the local authority housing waiting list.  Accordingly, if it is bought with a tenancy intact, then in some way that subverts that process.  We need to find a vehicle or some manner in which local authorities and voluntary housing associations can buy properties where receivers have been appointed and where tenants are <i>in situ<\/i>.  A significant number of these tenants are already on the local authority housing waiting list and in receipt of rent supplement.  A significant number of them are also vulnerable and liable to end up in homeless services.  Will this be considered by the Department an important measure to take?  We are limiting our capacity to purchase properties by insisting they are left vacant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked about the tenancies at risk.  The majority of tenants who come to Threshold whose tenancies are at risk would be in situations where a receiver has been appointed or a lending institution is seeking repossession of their property.  There is little if any guidance as to how this process happens.  Due to a loophole in the Residential Tenancies Act, they are not considered to be landlords for the purposes of the Act.  This means a landlord's statutory obligations do not apply to either a receiver or a lending institution.  This needs to be changed.<\/p> <p>  Threshold is advocating that the definition of &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 be widened to include a receiver or a lending institution.  This would provide some greater security to tenants, particularly to those whose properties have gone into receivership.  The receiver or a lending institution would then take on the responsibilities of the landlord.<\/p> <p>  The deletion of section 42 of the 2004 Act, under head 26, is a welcome development.  However, it still does not go far enough in providing for indefinite tenancies for tenants in the private rental sector.  The continued existence of Part 4 tenancies means that tenancies at the end of a four-year cycle can be brought to an end.  We believe this needs to be removed to ensure indefinite tenancies become the norm, as is the case in mainland Europe.  This is a measure also supported by the National Economic and Social Council in a 2015 report.  There certainly need to be changes in that area.<\/p> <p>  On those on year-to-year tenancies, the protection of the Residential Tenancies Act and Part 4 tenancies will actually kick in regardless of whether an individual is signing a succession of one-year leases.  It will still have the statutory protections.  However, as I have said, they do not go far enough and these tenancies can still become at-risk at the end of a Part 4 cycle.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps we will not focus on Senator Murnane O'Connor's point about landlords refusing HAP, the housing assistance payment.  Recently, however, changes to the Equal Status Act mean that refusal by a landlord to accept a HAP or rent supplement tenant is actually in breach of the legislation.  In theory, there is protection under the Equal Status Act.  Proving that a landlord is refusing is certainly an issue, however.<\/p> <p>  On notice periods, particularly when a property is being sold, under the Residential Tenancies Act the amount of notice a tenant is entitled to goes from 28 days to 224 days, depending on the length of the tenancy.  In a situation where a landlord tells a tenant that she or he is selling the property and needs them out in two months or two weeks, this would not be valid under the Act.  It underlines the real need for a strategic approach to housing advice and advocacy services.  There is certainly a need for an awareness campaign to ensure tenants are aware of their rights under the law, as well as making public representatives and statutory and voluntary agencies aware they can refer tenants who face these types of problem to a relevant agency such as Threshold to provide them with advice they need to ensure their rights are upheld under the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmaid O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The tenancy protection service run by Threshold in Dublin, Cork, Galway and the Dublin commuter counties is, we hope, due to be extended nationally.

The child care measures announced in yesterday's budget can be wiped out in one fell swoop with a 10% to 20% increase in rent.

I confirm that applications to the board will only be made where in the local development plan process in the local authority a clear decision and a requirement for housing has been signalled and the local authority has not zoned the areas in question.  I suspect the board will not even accept an application in the first instance where this has not happened.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paudie Coffey raised an important point that beyond the single prong of assessing individual applications as part of a multi-prong approach by the Government to deal with the housing crisis, there is the more fundamental question of how as a country we plan for the next 20 years as part of the national planning framework and how we can accommodate an additional 750,000 people who are expected to be living in the country and how this will impact on zoning decisions at local and regional level.  This is where elected members and local authorities will have a central role to play in assessing requirements and addressing planning issues not only in urban areas where a lot of urgent actions need to be taken, in housing supply, dealing with homelessness and easing pressures on the rental sector, but also in smaller towns and rural areas.  That is the key to how we ensure the country will be in a better place in 2040.<\/p> <p>  On applications being reviewed, in many cases we are seeing them being resubmitted because of economic changes.  They might have been for multi-unit apartment blocks, but there is no longer a market for such accommodation and people are looking to do different things within the land involved.  In some cases, planning permissions are being extended.  There is provision for an extension where circumstances are beyond the control of the developer.  We have seen examples of applications for large sites being resubmitted to take account of demand in the market in which circumstances are different from what they were eight or ten years ago.<\/p> <p>  Senator Victor Boyhan asked how the appeals process would work.  It would be a judicial review.  The board deals primarily with normal applications and has to be clear in making its decision and its reasons for it.  If somebody is unhappy with that decision, it may be appealed by way of a judicial review, as happens in many other cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1476261000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>It costs money to appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22016101200002#Q00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476261000,"counter":211,"content":"<p>It behoves us to ensure an application is correct at the earliest point in the process and we take account of all views.<\/p> <p>  On flood relief measures, a point was made about about the OPW having access.

If a planning matter is screened and under the EIA threshold, it is an opportunity for individuals, as well as the State bodies, to deal with the issues involved.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fergus O'Dowd mentioned empty houses.  There is nothing in the scheme of the Bill that will address that issue, but I draw the committee's attention to a number of measures in the action plan under which, as part of the announcements made in the budget, there will be a range of schemes in place, for example, the buy-and-renew scheme for which &euro;25 million has been set aside next year and the repair and leasing initiative, for which &euro;6 million has been allocated.  More broadly, there is a commitment to have in place by the end of the year a vacant housing reuse strategy which will look at both privately and publicly owned housing to ensure maximum use is made of it.  I fully agree that this is where there is potential in the short term to get properties back into use and look at the issues surrounding the provision of student accommodation to be released into the private market.<\/p> <p>  On the residential land initiative, if local authorities purchase lands, they can go through the Part VIII process which has obviously been streamlined and further reformed.<\/p> <p>  Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of fees.

I will probably not cover all of the questions raised.  <\/p> <p>  As Dr. Hayden mentioned, the legislation does not address all of the problems in the rental sector.  Clearly, it does not, but it is not intended to.  We are in the process of developing a strategy for the residential rental sector which will be published later this year.  It will cover many of the issues raised and there will be an opportunity to engage in consultation in its development and that process will start later this month.  All of the issues raised about extending the definition of landlord, dealing with the problem of landlords who are over-leveraged, the owners of buy-to-lets properties who are in arrears and moving towards greater long-term security of tenure for tenants will be addressed in the strategy.<\/p> <p>  I would like to respond to a number of the specific questions asked.  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin asked the reason heads 22 and 23 were needed.  It is to reflect the changed reality in which approved housing bodies are leasing properties in the private market.  The conditions applying to the registration of these tenancies should be the same as those applying to properties they own.<\/p> <p>  On head 25, there was a good deal of discussion in arriving at the numbers mentioned.  Numbers above and below them were considered.  This is an immediate response to a particular problem which we are trying to avoid happening again, but, by the same token, we do not consider the matter closed.  We will deal with it in the strategy.  We do not want to see properties in the rental sector being sold to avoid that sector shrinking.  We do not want to see people losing their homes.  There are issues with the removal of a right to terminate a tenancy in order to sell a property.  There are property ownership issues in that regard and we are seeking legal advice on the matter.  We think the way it is phrased is appropriate for the moment, but we may look at it again in the strategy.  Linked with this, the greatest risk of the termination of tenancies lies with landlords who own single units.<\/p> <p>  With respect to data for those in mortgage arrears, the vast majority are landlords with a small number of properties.  That is the issue about which we need to think.  More than 85% of tenancy agreements are with landlords who own one or two properties.  To respond to the questions raised about the changes to the procedures of the Residential Tenancies Board, the aim in reducing the notice period for appeals, the number of people on tribunals and trying to speed up the process is very much to try to and stop landlords with a single unit or two units from being forced into insolvency.  Once a dispute starts and a decision is appealed to the Residential Tenancies Board, in all cases the tenancy cannot be terminated.  In a number of cases the rent is not paid, which can push many landlords over the edge into insolvency.  The issues involved are very much connected.  Again, this is something with which we need to deal.  How do we deal with the problem of landlords who are over-leveraged? <\/p> <p>  On head 26 and whether the condition on the removal of the probation period at the beginning of a Part 4 tenancy applies to approved housing bodies, my understanding is that it does not.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor's question on the regulations covering notice periods, the periods are laid down and depend on the length of a tenancy.  If notice is not given, a tenant has the right to raise the issue with the Residential Tenancies Board.<\/p> <p>  On the point raised by Threshold about head 28 and how the deposit scheme will be more effective in speeding up the processes involved, that is probably true, but from the information from it, the greatest number of cases referred to the Residential Tenancies Board concern invalid notice and rent arrears, while deposit retention is No. 3 on the list.  It is significant, but there are other issues that occupy much of the board capacity and resources.<\/p> <p>  The consultation process will be launched later this month and extend for a period of about two weeks.

The joint committee has identified oversight and accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as one of its priority issues in its 2016 work programme.  The chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring appeared before the committee last month and Ms Josephine Feehily of the Policing Authority appeared before it two weeks ago.  Representatives from the Garda Inspectorate will come before us next week.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Ms O'Sullivan and her colleagues: Mr. Eugene Corcoran, assistant commissioner for governance and accountability; Mr. Joseph Nugent, newly appointed chief administrative officer; Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, deputy commissioner for governance and strategy; Mr. Jack Nolan, assistant commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region; and Dr. Gurchand Singh, head of the analysis service.  The other colleagues of the Commissioner who are seated behind are Mr. Alan Mulligan, head of the civilian human resources section, Mr. Ken Ruane, head of the legal affairs, Mr. Andrew McLindon, director of communications, Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, assistant commissioner for executive support and corporate services, Ms Anne Marie McMahon, assistant commissioner for the southern region, Mr. Matt Nyland, chief superintendent for policy development, implementation and monitoring, and Mr. Aidan Glacken, chief superintendent of the strategic transformation office.  I welcome everyone and thank the Commissioner on behalf of the committee for accepting our invitation to take part in this structured engagement, which we hope will inform us in the preparation of a report on Garda oversight and accountability that we aim to present to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality before the end of the month.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that the Commissioner will be invited to make a brief opening statement.  This will be followed by a question-and-answer session in which members can indicate and I will take them in the order in which they do so.<\/p> <p>  Before we do that, I must issue the privilege reminder, which is part of the requirement of our meeting.  I draw the Commissioner and her colleagues' attention as our witnesses to the situation in respect of privilege.  The witnesses should please note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  It is my wish, and I expect it will be the case, that the Commissioner will be afforded the same courtesy that all other invitees to the committee have enjoyed.  Members can, and no doubt will, ask salient and searching questions.  That is what the exchange is all about.  Without further commentary, I invite the Commissioner to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#A00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for introducing my colleagues, which I will not now do.<\/p> <p>  A core focus of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working in partnership with communities and ensuring that we protect them.  As such, I thank the committee for the opportunity to update it on the progress that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is making in that respect, particularly regarding our working in partnership with community groups and others.<\/p><p>As the committee will be aware, the issue of burglaries in rural communities and communities all over the country has been a key concern and priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the past year.  Early in 2015, when burglaries were beginning to become more frequent, we started to plan the implementation of a new multi-strand approach to tackling key crimes.  As a result, we started to implement Operation Thor in November 2015.  Operation Thor used advance analysis to identify burglary hotspots and prolific offenders and increased patrols were put into such areas.  We ran a public awareness campaign on how people could protect their homes and reduce the opportunities for criminals to commit crimes.  We conducted numerous checkpoints to stop criminal gangs using the road network.  We ensured repeat offenders who carry out the vast majority of burglaries were put under increased scrutiny.  We particularly targeted high-impact prolific offenders.  We worked in partnership with community groups in urban and rural areas.<\/p><p> The pay-off from Operation Thor has been a reduction in burglaries.  The number of such crimes fell by 30% in the first quarter of 2016 and by over 25% in the second quarter.  According to our public attitudes survey, the proportion of people who perceived that crime was a serious or very serious problem in their local areas dropped from 33% in the third quarter of 2015, at the height of the public's concern about burglaries, to 25% in the second quarter of 2016.  We are conscious that statistics cannot be used as an excuse for under-estimating or disregarding the impact that crime has on an individual.  That is a key focus as we support the victims of crime.  As burglaries tend to rise during the longer winter nights, Operation Thor will continue in partnership with the community with the aim of keeping burglaries down and keeping the fear of crime low.  In that regard, we welcome the Government's announcement in yesterday's budget that continued funding for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will allow us to plan for the future and particularly for the year ahead.<\/p><p> Our close relationship with communities and the support we get from them is vital in preventing and tackling crime, particularly in rural areas.  We can achieve greater results by working in partnership with the community.  The Text Alert scheme, which was introduced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in co-operation with Muintir na T&iacute;re, Neighbourhood Watch and the Irish Farmers Association, is an excellent example of this.  The purpose of the scheme, under which communities set up groups to receive alerts advising them of suspicious or criminal activity in their local areas, is to ensure awareness among users of the service and lead them to report suspicious activity to the Garda.  A total of 985 Text Alert groups exist throughout the country.  More than 175,000 people are Text Alert members.  In the average month, more than 430,000 text messages are sent using the system to prevent and detect crimes.  The feedback we have received from the community shows the Text Alert scheme provides reassurance while at the same time alerting garda&iacute;.  We have also worked with the IFA on the TheftStop initiative, which is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID and registered on a nationwide database.  We will continue to examine new ways to prevent and detect crime in rural and urban areas by continuing our tradition of working with and building stronger partnerships with the community.  It is by listening to the community that we can understand exactly how we can provide a service.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, organised crime has posed serious challenges for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year.  We have made significant progress in disrupting and tackling organised crime gangs over recent months.  As part of our modernisation and renewal programme, we have built on our expertise in the drugs and organised crime area by amalgamating our skills and introducing a special crime task force to focus on criminals working at lower levels in organised crime gangs.  Members will have seen the results.  Significant arrests and seizures in recent weeks have substantially disrupted and degraded organised crime gangs by taking guns, drugs and cash from them.  Lives have been saved and more than 12 assassination attempts have been foiled.  The threat posed by organised crime gangs remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> To give the committee a flavour of what has been done, I can state that between 9 March 2015, when the drugs and organised crime bureau was established, and September 2016, we seized over &euro;1.9 million in cash, as well as 35 guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, including AK-74 assault rifles, submachine guns, sawn-off shotguns, Glock pistols and other semi-automatic weapons and silencers.  Drugs worth more than &euro;36 million have been seized and we have arrested 167 people for drug trafficking, money laundering and possession of firearms.  The many organised crime gangs that operate internationally cannot be tackled effectively without international co-operation.  We work actively with our counterparts in Europe and with Europol and Interpol.  This was seen in recent operations in Dublin and Spain and again last week in Kilkenny.  For the first time, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were accompanied by colleagues from La Guardia Civil on an operation in Dublin and we had officers present for La Guardia Civil operations in Marbella.  Such operations require significant planning and information sharing over a long and protracted period of time.  In that case, it had a significant pay-off and gives us a template for future joint operations.<\/p><p> Having spoken about the day job of providing a policing and security service and keeping communities safe, I would like to touch briefly on the modernisation and renewal programme.  This comprehensive programme of reform is being undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the same time as doing the day job of providing policing and security.  This is the biggest programme of change in the 94-year history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will change An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na significantly and prepare it for the next 100 years of policing in Ireland.  It will make the Garda a beacon of 21st century policing and security.  As a result, the people of our country will be proud of the service and our members will be proud to serve in it.  The programme is based on feedback from the public, our own people and critical friends such as this committee, the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p> The development of our programme of reform took on board the recommendations of all 11 reports of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which contained over 1,000 recommendations on how improvements could be made to policing.  For the first time in the history of the organisation, we have been able to use these recommendations to prepare a coherent roadmap for the delivery of real reform over the next five years.  We have spent a considerable part of the last two years ensuring we secure the commitment and investment required to deliver these real reforms.  We welcome this committee's decision to look at the oversight and accountability arrangements for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The recent introduction of the Policing Authority, along with the oversight arrangements by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, will provide an opportunity to meet the shared objective of promoting confidence in policing and ensuring there is transparency, such as appearances before this committee, where the public can hold us to account.<\/p><p> Changes already have been introduced under the programme that benefitted individual citizens and communities.  These include the setting up of 28 victim service offices and the bringing together of expertise in specialist areas like drugs, organised crime, sexual crime and domestic violence.  This will help to protect our most vulnerable victims.  We have secured substantial investment in new vehicles and technology to create a better infrastructure for our own people and the communities we serve.  We are working more closely with criminal justice partners to identify and manage repeat offenders who cause harm to communities.  We have enhanced training and supports for all employees.  We are creating greater partnerships in collaboration with private industry and academia.  A significant restructuring of the organisation will give regional officers greater responsibility to make decisions based on taking account of local policing needs, listening to local communities and understanding what their requirements are.  Restructuring at headquarters level will ensure we flatten our bureaucracy, as outlined by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, and we have greater transparency, governance and accountability.<\/p><p> I am offering this level of detail because it is crucial that our legislators, and through them the public, know the progress we are making and the progress we plan to make in the coming months and years.  This includes the introduction of advanced IT systems and technology to enhance the investigation of crime.  We will hire civilians with the right skills and place them in the right roles to enhance the professionalism of the organisation and increase Garda presence in the community.  We will improve how we investigate cybercrime and economic crime.  We will enhance collaboration with national and international partners to tackle and disrupt terrorism and organised crime.  Continuous professional development, mentoring and coaching will be provided to support the development and skills of all members and staff.  All of this will accompany the renewal of Garda culture so that we are more open to internal and external dissent.  There will be a focus on attitudes and behaviours that live up to our values, including our new value of empathy.  We will learn from the experience and expertise of our partners.  There will be a major focus on strengthening the governance of the organisation and enhancing our approach to risk management.<\/p><p> We are determined that anyone who brings forward issues or concerns will be listened to and supported.  As part of this approach, we have introduced a protected disclosures policy, appointed protected disclosure managers, put a structure in place and ensured all personnel have been informed of these measures.  We recognise this needs to be a process of continuous improvement.  That is why we are taking external advice on our policies and procedures.<\/p><p>We also welcome the Policing Authority&rsquo;s review of our protected disclosures policy and would welcome the views of the joint committee on the matter as well.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to real change and this has begun.  This major journey of renewal will not be quick or easy.  It is widely recognised that cultural change takes time, but change is happening.  It must happen because we are all committed to providing the communities we serve with the best policing and security service in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat Commissioner O'Sullivan.

The work of the Garda is at the heart of keeping people safe and protecting our country every day.

We were reminded of that most poignantly last night as we attended a mass in Blackrock, County Louth for our colleague, Garda Tony Golden, who was shot and murdered in the line of duty while he was protecting a vulnerable woman one year ago yesterday afternoon.  I thank Deputy Brophy for that and we will certainly pass that on to our members.<br\/><br\/>That is the key function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the men and women who join on Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do exactly that.  They know the courage that is required at any given hour of the day can be called upon.  They know the dedication and professionalism they need to go about their duty, whether it be like Garda Tony Golden, whether it be on the checkpoint, whether it be like what happened last Friday, confronting armed criminals who were about to cause harm to a community in Dunboyne, or whether it be like last Thursday in Kilkenny, where there were 64 arrests.  A number of international observers were present to look at how we operate and how we target crime and harm to communities.  I thank the Deputy for his remarks.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked about public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and some of his later questions speak to how we have done that.  Let me give a very tangible example.  In April 2014 when I took over as Commissioner, trust and confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had reached an all-time low of 67% according to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  We made it one of our objectives to work on restoring that confidence and trust.  By international comparisons the level of 67% was high, but by Irish standards that had dipped to an all-time low.  When I say that to colleagues internationally, they look in wonder.  What we have done, and I will ask my colleague, Dr. Singh, to speak on it, is borne out in our most recent public attitude survey which shows that trust and confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been restored to more than 85%.  As Deputy Brophy said in his opening address, there is no doubt that confidence can be eroded very quickly.  That is something we will never take for granted.  We must ensure we build on that trust and that we maintain the trust and confidence of the community every day.<br\/><br\/>Some of the key priorities we have for doing that, and I have outlined some of them in my opening address, is making sure there is high visibility engagement in communities and that our members are out and about engaging with the public.  We have had feedback from communities.  Most recently my colleague, Assistant Commissioner Nolan attended a forum in the city and prior to that we met the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  The Lord Mayor said that the feedback he is getting is that they are seeing more garda&iacute; in the community.  It is not just seeing garda&iacute; but seeing them engaging with the communities.  That is something we have started with our recruits who, thankfully, are now coming back into the college.  We are making sure there are members out in the community visibly and actively and proactively engaging with people.  We are making sure we have high visibility, particularly in rural areas, where people are very fearful.  We have listened very carefully to communities.  We are getting the feedback from communities throughout the country, including in the city where sometimes people can feel very isolated and alone, that they are seeing more garda&iacute;.  We very much welcome the Government's commitment to the 800 new recruits for next year because the new student garda&iacute; will be out in the community.  It takes the presence of garda&iacute; to do this.<br\/><br\/>The professionalism of the Garda and how the members do their job is very important.  We established victim service offices, and our feedback from victims of crime and particularly as outlined in the O'Higgins report and the Garda Inspectorate report was that victims did not always feel they were treated appropriately.  We prioritised victims of crime.  We set up 28 victim service offices, one in every Garda division, staffed by both Garda and civilian members.  That speaks to the cultural renewal, making sure that Garda and civilian members were working side by side in a key area such as providing support to victims of crime.  We worked with the victims of crime groups to hear their feedback and understand what they needed.  We also make sure that when a crime happens, we support the victim and also investigate the crime professionally to ensure the best outcome.  Again we work very closely with the Forensic Science Laboratory in making sure that we use the best in forensic technology to ensure charges are sustained against people, and an example of that would be the Graham Dwyer murder investigation where the best and most advanced technology was used.<br\/><br\/>Again, in terms of making sure that we have a professional fit for purpose police force, civilianisation - we like to call it professionalisation - plays a key role.  The Government announcement yesterday or today to increase civilianisation by 2,000 before 2021, bringing it up to a total of 4,000, is very welcome.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Brophy asked me to outline the priorities in terms of the prioritisation around professionalisation.  My colleague, Mr. Nugent, and his colleagues in HR have developed a workforce plan in which we have identified up to 600 positions that we would like to have prioritised and filled this year.  We are working very closely with the Policing Authority, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and our own Department to ensure those positions are prioritised.  Some of the positions are around data quality management, risk management and, at the assistant commissioner level of our organisation, having somebody for legal and compliance, ensuring we are compliant with the regulatory frameworks and ensuring we can provide not just the service to the community but the accountability that is required.<\/p><p> I can ask my colleague, Mr. Joe Nugent, to go into more detail about it.<\/p><p> Deputy Brophy also mentioned the Garda Reserve.  Yesterday, the budget provided that the Garda Reserve would be increased.  During the past 18 months we have established a dedicated Garda Reserve office and examined increasing the powers of the Garda Reserve to ensure the reserves can be deployed more effectively.  We also want to ensure that, after ten years in operation, we recognise the contribution the Garda Reserve has made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, working alongside their full-time colleagues.  We want to develop it into the future.  In particular, we want to encourage people to come and build confidence and trust, and build a bridge with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We want people from minority communities and those who may not have always traditionally joined the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to come and join the Garda Reserve and see how we operate, hopefully with a view to joining full time.<\/p><p>Deputy Brophy asked about international co-operation.  We have always participated in international co-operation, and it is vital and essential given the policing and security challenges policing and intelligence services are facing the world over.  We have built on it over the years.  We have tremendous relationships with Europol, Interpol, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, which allow us to have outreach to countries where some of our indigenous countries have decided to place themselves.  It also allows us to go upstream and target people who are sourcing drugs from areas around the world.  It allows us to work in true partnership and collaboration.  We have also used those partnerships to provide training to our people.  Recently, the Guardia Civil and the Policia National came here and assisted in operations, and we will see more of this.  It is the future of policing.  We must ensure this level of co-operation is strengthened and built upon to ensure we protect all our communities here at home and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>We run a public attitudes survey on trust levels within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The behaviour and attitude survey to which Dr. Singh referred is indicative of the work the Commissioner is doing.  She is leading an operation which is in change mode.  It is interesting that the survey that put confidence above 85% happened within the first 12 months of the Commissioner taking charge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have observed the Commissioner, and the decency with which she goes about her business and her personal work ethic is a fantastic example to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are very fortunate that more than 85% of our population have confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Unfortunately, in the media circus that spins around on a regular basis, these facts and figures get lost.  It is important we put it on the record.<\/p><p>Deputy Colm Brophy said we had the Policing Authority before the committee recently.  I would be interested in the Commissioner's views on the Policing Authority and its evolving relationship with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important that an equilibrium be achieved.  The critique following the first public meeting of the Policing Authority said the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had had a difficult encounter.  I would be interested in the Commissioner's views on the Policing Authority and whether there is anything in its <i>modus operandi<\/i>that needs to change.  There is a review after two years.<\/p><p>It has been flagged that there will be a Garda strike of some sort next month.  I would be interested to hear the contingency plans the Commissioner has in place to deal with it, assuming the dispute is not resolved and a significant number of her colleagues are not prepared to play ball on those four Fridays.  Regarding the plan for the modernisation of the force, how do we rate internationally?  In terms of the behaviour and attitude survey, we rate very well.  In terms of a modern police force, how do we compare internationally?<\/p><p>The Commissioner mentioned the text alerts, which is using modern technology, particularly in rural areas, very effectively.  There is a cost to communities which set up text alert groups, which is probably unfair.  Is the cost still in place and is it the intention of the Commissioner or the Government to eliminate the cost over time?  Perhaps the Commissioner cannot comment on it.  Deputy Colm Brophy mentioned JPCs.  Josephine Feehily met the chairmen of the JPCs at a recent meeting.  Has the Commissioner ever brought the chairmen of the JPCs into a meeting to have a discourse such as we are having here?  Her representatives all over the country attend the JPCs regularly.  The JPCs have an important role which must be developed, nurtured and built upon.  The Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might consider it in due course.  Perhaps she could have some sort of engagement even with the chairmen for a day in Dublin or in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na headquarters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#D00400","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Would the Chairman like me to answer all the questions together as I did for Deputy Colm Brophy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>If you do not mind.

The trust levels in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are very much due to the men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the work they do every day.  I also acknowledge it and pay tribute to all the men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Without them, we would not have those levels of trust and confidence.  Without the support of the community, which we do not take for granted, we could not do the job we do, and we very much thank the communities for the support they continue to provide.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the Policing Authority.  As the Senator knows, the Policing Authority was incepted on 1 January this year and is still in the first nine months of operation, but is very welcome.  Along with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, it provides a framework of oversight and accountability, including oversight of the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which, along with the JPCs, which I will come back to, provides, I hope, more transparency and accountability.<\/p><p>The public meetings with the authority are both searching - as with this committee - and robust in nature.  That is really good as it allows us to challenge some of our own assumptions about the delivery of a policing service.  It allows us to hear the different perspectives and opinions of the chairman and eight members of the committee.  All the authority members come with their individual experience and expertise.  We are eager and willing to learn from that.<\/p><p> I will jump to the joint policing committees, JPCs.  The Senator stated that the chair of the authority recently organised a meeting and my colleague, Assistant Commissioner Nolan, and other members represented An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We certainly will take on board the comment about having meetings with the JPCs.  I share the Senator's view that the joint policing committees have a key role to play in ensuring local accountability and in making sure the delivery of a policing service is tailored to meet local needs.  In other words, we can hear from local representatives what the priorities for the community are and we can ensure our assistant commissioners and chief superintendents are delivering that service with support at headquarters level.  Assistant Commissioner Nolan can give an overview of that interaction with the JPCs if that is helpful.  We welcome the authority and it is very much part of the future of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of that level of oversight that allows us to be there.<\/p><p> The Senator asked about our plan for change and how it compares internationally.  As I stated, we were very fortunate that we have all 11 reports of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  We have brought a copy of the plan for all the members and we will make that available.  I would also like to extend an invitation to the committee to come to Garda headquarters and see our programme of work and the transformation office.  We got very valuable insights from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which brings international policing experience.  We did not just stop at that.  All the challenges we face in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are being faced by police services the world over.  We looked at other change programmes in New Zealand, Scotland and other police forces in the UK and right across the world.  We looked at the International Association of Chiefs of Police and all the police forces in America and benchmarked ourselves against all of those.<\/p><p> We take stock of what is happening right across the world and we consider if we are doing the right things in the right sequence.  An interesting international debate currently comes back to the point about trust.  It concerns police legitimacy and whether the police are engaged in the community in the way they should be.  It gives me great pride to say that many representatives of police forces are coming here to look at exactly what we are doing with police training and how we go about our engagement with the community, as they did in Kilkenny last week.  My experience is that we benchmark well internationally but our programme office monitors that very closely.<\/p><p> I extend the invitation to the committee to come to Garda headquarters.  I will ask my colleague, Assistant Commissioner Nolan, to deal with the JPCs and Text Alert scheme asked about by Senator Conway in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The JPCs were established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, allowing a forum for meetings between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities, elected and community representatives.  This enables a joint understanding of the challenges associated with policing at a local level.  A chief superintendent or superintendent attends all JPC meetings.  I attend the Dublin city JPC every month, which includes elected and community representatives, along with other representatives from non-governmental organisations etc.  At those meetings, local problems and particular issues of the day are discussed.<\/p> <p>  In early September the Policing Authority held a forum for all chairs of JPCs.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was represented at that meeting and although we did not have a direct role in the consultation process on the day, we attended as observers.  We have a central monitoring office for the JPCs across the organisation and that unit is based in our community engagement section in Harcourt Square in Dublin.  Our representatives monitor the annual reports from the JPCs.<\/p> <p>  In effect, the JPCs allow an understanding, awareness and joint action in many areas associated with problems relating to crime or other social or anti-social issues that emerge at a local level.  It is a very effective partnership arrangement between the JPCs and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has been pretty good for the past ten years and it was reviewed a couple of years ago, with a revision from 121 JPCs to 31 committees now.  That streamlined attendances, processes and procedures.  It also required each JPC to create a strategic plan for that JPC over a number of years.  It is a very good engagement forum between communities, local government and authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner asked me to address the Text Alert scheme.  As Senator Conway stated, this again has been an innovative development in community engagement, safety and policing.  It emerged both from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the communities themselves.  Technology had caught up on communications forums and mechanisms and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was happy to harness that.  At that time I had responsibility for the sections that developed the process, and they worked in close partnership with Muintir na T&iacute;re, a wonderful organisation operating in every part of the country.  At the same time, the Irish Farmers Association sought to be involved in the process and we were able to develop it with a tripartite approach.  It is a text alert system with almost 1,000 units or neighbourhoods attached.  I attended meetings in all parts of the country when I was in that role in the south-eastern region.  There have been millions of text messages issued.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had some substantial successes as a result of the community engagement in various parts of the country as a result.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious the Irish Farmers Association is currently developing another version of it entirely for the farming association.  We have a phenomenon of rural crime and it will probably be addressed later.  This is response mechanism by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, working in close collaboration with our partner agencies.  There will be other partner agencies that will engage over time.<\/p> <p>  Other developments in the area, which we may deal with from a crime prevention aspect, include the TheftStop initiative, which was again developed through collaboration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Farmers Association.  It is designed to enable property items in farming and rural areas to be easily identifiable.  The amount of property stolen that has been marked with a specific and unique identifying number is minimal.  At every forum I attend, I encourage people to engage with the initiative.  It is relatively cheap but there is a slight charge.  Everything costs money nowadays.  The Senator mentioned the cost of the Text Alert scheme, which is primarily associated with insurance so that any person passing on a text alert message is indemnified if there is fall-out from it.  I have always been very keen to emphasise engagement with Text Alert schemes through Muintir na T&iacute;re, which has the structure to set it up and the facilities for insurance covering all participants.  I have no doubt there will be further development in the area of Text Alert, TheftStop and other initiatives that we are progressing with partner agencies across the country at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jack Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on the proposed four days of industrial action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#E00300","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Yes.

Second is the investigative strand, which means we are investigating the murders and third, the intelligence strand.

The Commissioner has outlined the three strand approach.  The preventive strand comes under the auspices of Operation Hybrid.  Operation Hybrid performs approximately 90 checkpoints per day, supported by armed personnel at strategic locations across all the districts in Dublin.  These locations are selected by local detective sergeants and detective inspectors, based on their local knowledge of suspects who reside in the area, suspected persons who may come to the area and potential targets who live in the area.  These checkpoints have had some spectacular results.  We have estimated that we have prevented the loss of life of at least ten people in the feuding.  We have had numerous captures of firearms, persons intercepted on their way to a potential killings, lots of drugs recovered.  I can give significant detail, as I have it with me.<\/p> <p>  These checkpoints are monitored on a daily basis from a central location in Command and Control in Dublin.  The completion rate for these checkpoints is at approximately 80%.  The other 20% would be diverted to incidents or to ongoing issues.  We have a very viable, robust and successful programme operating to prevent people losing their lives.  We would have examples of hybrid patrols, as we call them, dedicated units arriving on the scene of a shooting within 90 seconds to two minutes, recovering vehicles that have been used in shootings.  These recovered items that have been used in murders - and I have to be careful what I say around particular investigations - but many of these recovered items will feature in what I expect would be successful prosecutions in the future.  At this point eight people have been charged with murder in respect of the feud, 45 people have been arrested.<\/p><p>Approximately 9,000 investigative tasks are either completed or in progress.  More than 4,500 statements have been taken from witnesses.  That should give the committee a flavour of the scale of the investigation process that is ongoing.<\/p><p> The Commissioner has outlined the international element to this investigation, which is very important.  This is being pursued vigorously.  People will have seen the visible manifestations of that in recent weeks.  That will continue and the intelligence that comes from our international co-operation is vital in these operations.  There are many little-known facts that would not get into the public domain associated with that intelligence.  This allows operations to be run to disrupt the criminal activities of individuals associated with these gangs at the highest levels, at mid-level and at the lowest level.  Indeed, the establishment of the serious crime task force is aimed at targeting the mid-level operators, those who are managing the distribution of drugs and using the proceeds of the sale of those drugs for illicit purposes.  This is being significantly progressed daily.  My people and those of my colleagues around the table who are working in these areas get a weekly briefing on progress, the setting of targets and the revision of targets that have to be met.<\/p><p> This is a big operation.  It has been a big operation since early February and it will continue to be a big operation throughout the rest of this year and into next year.  As I have said in other public fora, I am confident we will see other people charged with these crimes and brought before the courts of justice.  Many of the investigation files are moving towards completion stage.  This is not easy to do.  They are complex, time consuming and labour intensive, but we are progressing many of these investigations.  I confidently expect further charges to emanate in the not-too-distant future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jack Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Thank you, Assistant Commissioner Nolan.

In 2014, we went around and listened to our people.  I mentioned that as part of our plan.  We have spent the past two years feeding back to our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the issues we are hearing from our members.  My colleague, Mr. Nugent, has touched on the issues.  They include the moratorium.  We were no different from any other public sector agency.  There were no recruits and no new people.  Policing is something that requires fresh people all the time and a turnover not only for members but also for the community.  Recruitment and investment in the fleet have certainly helped.  New cars allow people to be able to get out and do their job.  New technology also helps.  We are addressing issues around uniforms as well.  These are the internal issues.  It is important to ensure people feel empowered to do their job.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers asked what we can do.  There is no doubt that the residual issue is pay.  That is being addressed in different circumstances.  There is another issue which feeds in to the potential to erode public confidence.  Our people go about their job every day.  As several Deputies have alluded to, members of the force go out every day to do the best job they can do, often in dangerous and hazardous circumstances.  They do this with the full knowledge that they have the support of the people in the communities they serve.  Anything that would erode confidence in that support is dangerous and has the potential to impact not alone on morale but to erode and impact on public confidence as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>One of the things we will be doing is to put in place a cultural audit.

It means changing and challenging attitudes and behaviours in a robust way on occasion and in a way that sometimes people may not necessarily like.  However, the job of leadership is to make sure that decisions are taken and actioned, and that there is a direction in which the organisation, and in our case the service, is going.  That is what we are doing.  That was the frame in terms of my opening address.  We are on a journey of cultural renewal, change, modernisation and professionalism, which will make the organisation a better service for the communities we serve.

There was much talk about cultural change when the former Commissioner, Martin Callinan, and the former Minister, Alan Shatter, went, but many people in the Commissioner's organisation, and we communicate with many of them, would argue that not only has the culture not changed but, if anything, it has deteriorated.  What does the Commissioner say to the comments many would have put to us that she has promoted many people about whom complaints have been made, that she promoted her husband and her bridesmaid, and that she surrounded herself with her supporters rather than concentrating on promoting quality personnel?  When the PSNI was formed, the Patten report recommended that if it was serious and wanted to change the culture in terms of how policing was done in Northern Ireland, it would have to get rid of the existing hierarchy.

I want to get that one out of the way.<\/p> <p>  I will speak my mind.  If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or a member of any organisation, is defined by the person they just happen to be associated with, be it through marriage or otherwise, I do not believe that is appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I will talk about the generalities of promotion within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In April 2014, when I took over from my predecessor, I took over in an interim acting capacity as acting interim Commissioner.  That remained the position for nine months while there was an international head hunt competition.  It was the first time ever in the history of the State that a Commissioner was selected from an international head hunt competition.  It was conducted independently.  There were a number of international people on the panel.  There were a number of international competitors.  I am very lucky in so far as I was the person chosen through that competition.  Getting this job was not easy, nor would I have expected that to be the case.  It reinforces my confidence in my own ability but also in the fact that I was chosen by an independent panel as being the person best suited for the job.<\/p><p>That is an important factor to bear in mind.  In terms of internal promotion competitions, they are also done under very strict guidelines.  For the information of the committee, the chair and the board members are independently chosen from a panel prepared by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are represented on it and any competitions are done in accordance with fair procedure and due diligence under the authority of the chair of the board.  People who come through those promotion competitions are selected on the basis of their proven ability when they present for interview.  It is a very important aspect that the committee needs to be aware of.  There is no such thing as me or any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appointing and anointing an individual member.  <\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned the cultural change.  Cultural change does not happen overnight.  It takes time and it is about attitudes and behaviours both internally and externally.  It is about making sure we have the support to make those cultural changes real.  We have started that with the training of our new students, with training for all of our people right throughout the organisation and by introducing civilianisation and new perspectives into the dynamic of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

He is welcome, as is the committee, to go any place he wishes throughout the organisation and see at first hand the changes that are happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#L02300","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Has the Commissioner ever taken steps to promote someone who had a complaint made against them by a whistleblower?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#M00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I do not understand the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am asking the Commissioner if she has ever taken steps to promote someone who may have had allegations made against him by a whistleblower?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#M00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Allegations such as those in the public domain at the moment are allegations until such time as they are proven.

This specially dedicated unit, which is staffed by Garda and civilian members, exists to ensure our most vulnerable victims are protected.  We will commence the regionalisation of that unit later this year.  In other words, there will be a protected services bureau in every Garda region.  We are mindful of the need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be in a position to play its part in the full implementation of the second strategy on domestic and gender-based violence.  We have provided for a number of training interventions.  We have worked with a number of non-governmental organisations and other groups to ensure appropriate training is provided.  One of the key priorities for the protected services bureau is the implementation of a risk identification tool that will facilitate the early identification of individuals who may be at risk following previous incidents.

In her address to us here, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring spoke about the delay in responding to requests for reports and other information.  GSOC makes requests but there is an inordinate delay, in her own words, and an untimeliness, in responding that makes the work of GSOC difficult.  I will call it, as we see it, an unco-operative pattern.  I believe it will not only prompt but necessitate legislative change compelling full and timely co-operation whereas voluntary co-operation and presentation might not necessitate such a change.  Would the Commissioner like to comment on it?  I note there is an upcoming meeting that Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in will attend.  It would be the universal view of members here that we would wish to see full co-operation in a timely manner with GSOC requests.<\/p> <p>  Allied to that, Ms Justice Ring also stated that many complaints presenting to GSOC would be more appropriately dealt with by Garda management locally, and she estimated that this amounted to 20% of the traffic presenting to GSOC over its almost decade in being.  She instanced that verbal abuse by garda&iacute; should be dealt with at a service level in a resolution focused approach rather than one that was seeking retribution and that the ethos of resolution-seeking with an apology would likely, as we would all recognise, satisfy the complainant rather than take up so much time at a senior level and encroach on already limited time on the address of the traffic of complaints.  Those are both elements relating to the GSOC presentation.<\/p> <p>  We had questions earlier on promotions.  Ms Josephine Feehily, the chairperson of the Policing Authority, indicated that at present the Policing Authority has responsibility for Commissioner and perhaps deputy commissioner level but expects that the power of appointment would come down the ranks over the period ahead.  Ms Feehily articulated the view that such would be a welcome development.  I would like to know the Commissioner's commentary on those two sets of respective points made by the previous presenters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#O00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I will deal with them, so to speak, back to front.  I will deal with the authority issue first and then I may ask my colleague, Assistant Commissioner Eugene Corcoran, to come in on the detail of the GSOC issues, which he has.<\/p> <p>  We very much welcome that the authority, as I understand will become more involved in the promotion process towards the end of the year.  From An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's point of view, that is a very welcome development.  My understanding is that the regulations will be enacted and that the authority will be in a position to start the process, it is hoped from some time around the year's end.  That is useful.<\/p> <p>  In that regard, I must also say that even in the current situation, until such time as those arrangements are put in place, we continue to have a number of critical gaps at both Garda and civilian levels, and my colleague, Mr. Nugent, is working with the authority in that regard.  However, we very much welcome that the authority will be taking over those appointments and we will support it in whatever way we can to do that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of GSOC, our objective always is to engage constructively with GSOC and to ensure anything that is required by GSOC is provided in a timely fashion.  Without repeating myself, in the 2015 report GSOC itself recognised that in the provision of information required, there is a 93.6% compliance rate, which is a very significant improvement on where it was.  There is still home for further improvement.  I will let my colleague, Assistant Commissioner Corcoran, talk about the complexities that are involved in the residual 6%, because some of the requests require further supplementary requests and requests can be ongoing outside of the 30 days.<\/p> <p>  We have no issue whatsoever with compellability but my objective is that at no stage should GSOC have to go to the courts to request compellability in anything.  I would absolutely share with Ms Justice Ring the voluntary part in terms of that being where we should be getting to and that being the purpose of the engagement at the various levels.  It is also important that this committee understands that structures have been put in place and that it happens at various levels - operational, tactical and strategic - with GSOC to ensure there is the provision of requests and an understanding of what is required.  Some of the requests, by their nature, are both complex and difficult to get from the areas that are required because sometimes the data require time to collate and retrieve, but that is something that we are working on.<\/p> <p>  We made a submission to the Oireachtas committee in 2014 where we very much concurred with the submission made by Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring to the committee recently, particularly on the issue of informal resolution and the category of service level complaints.<\/p><p>We feel that, as our culture changes, we want to move from a blame to a learning culture and we have articulated that in our plan.  We want to allow management to make the interventions required if somebody has a service level issue in terms of behaviour or attitude.  That needs to be addressed, whether through training, intervention or whatever.  We are very encouraged by Ms Justice Ring's submission in that regard and very much look forward to working with her.<\/p><p> As my colleague, Assistant Commissioner Corcoran, said earlier, we also welcome the review of the legislation.  After ten years in operation, its practical application has identified several lessons for us all and it is probably very timely.  Assistant Commissioner Corcoran can go into some detail on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>To put the matter in context, we noted the remarks of the commission and, in particular, the very fair remarks in its most recent annual report which set out that we had almost 94% compliance with the requests within the agreed protocol.  There is a protocol in place between GSOC and the Garda on the time limits within which responses with information are expected.  In 2015, the year of the report referred to, there were 335 such complaints.  These represent the almost 94% compliance rate with the protocol.  The remaining 6% represented some 21 cases.  It is not the position that the 6% represented requests in respect of which nothing was done.  There was partial compliance.  They were not completed but they were substantially completed.  We do, however, acknowledge that the timely provision of information is essential for GSOC and that continue to have a monthly dialogue in an attempt to improve that.  I expect that with the dialogue, and in the future, we will have a greater understanding of what causes delays.  Occasionally, the material sought can take a considerable time to gather.  It may not be readily accessible.  There may be other agencies, such as the Director of the Public Prosecutions, that require to be consulted on aspects of the complaint or it could be that the sheer volume of material sought requires time to gather.  These are logistical issues that arise from time to time.  In balancing those remarks, I accept the obvious advantage in any investigation of having the material sought at the earliest possible time and that is and remains a priority for the Garda.<\/p> <p>  The matter raised in respect of the service level complaints has been the subject of discussion between the Commission and the Garda for some considerable time.  In the fullness of time we will participate in the review that might, and hopefully will, bring about improvements.  We are, however, governed by the legislation.  Under the current legislation, all complaints must go to GSOC.  The appropriate amendments that eventually result from any review or consultation that takes place will bring about improvements in respect of that 20% of complaints to which the Deputy refers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Corcoran"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the assistant commissioner and the Commissioner.

We are very anxious to review the disciplinary regulations to make them more effective and to reduce the timelines and bureaucracy.  Any allegations of wrongdoing or gross misconduct by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including, recently, by the Commissioner, must be investigated in the interest of impartiality and objectivity by the Ombudsman Commission.  It is also important that a balance be struck on internal discipline issues.

The issues particularly around rural crime, including livestock, are kept under constant review by us and our colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and we have a specific focus on Border related crime, for people using the Border for plant machinery, farm equipment, cattle or livestock rustling.  My colleagues, Assistant Commissioner Nolan or Dr. Singh could give more detail if the Chairman wishes but it is an important focus for our cross-Border policing strategy, particularly at the operational and tactical level with colleagues north and south of the Border.  We are aware of several instances involving livestock or foodstuff.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a part to play in that and we liaise with it.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is perfectly right about the culture change.<\/p><p>I am not sure there is ever an endgame when it comes to culture.  Dr. Singh mentioned our culture audit so we are determined we are going to measure the impact of the cultural changes and the initiatives we are implementing.  We have gone to the marketplace and there will be an independent precise assessment of the impact of the cultural change, especially attitudes, behaviours and how the public is responding to those changes.  That is a very important part and there is no point in us just changing internally.  We must ensure the service changes as well.<\/p><p> I was asked if I am a hands-on Garda Commissioner.  Many people might say I am very hands on.  The tone from the top and the leadership through the organisation is important.  We must change attitudes and behaviours right throughout the organisation from the top down and bottom up.  The new recruitment of Garda members and civilian members is very welcome as they, along with reserve members, will bring additional expertise and perspectives that will help change the culture.  The reserve members are volunteers coming from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life.  That is where our focus rests.<\/p><p> Leadership is always a challenge.  It is about making hard decisions.  Sometimes one must listen and hear everybody and everybody must have a voice.  However, decisions must be made if we are to drive forward and implement real changes and reform.  That is where the focus lies.  It is important we look back on the past two years and see the tangible reforms and changes that have been achieved, not just internally but externally.

The majority of crime occurs in urban areas.  From a burglary perspective, this time last year there was much community concern and disquiet about the level of burglaries, but 26% of burglaries occur in rural areas.  In the 12 months just ended, there has been a 38% reduction in rural burglaries.  It is important to put that figure in the public domain.<\/p> <p>  There was a reference to livestock theft etc.  That issue has emerged but it has always been there.  I have no doubt that members might know people in their own constituency who have suffered such losses over the years.  There have been a number of major investigations in this regard.  In Mullingar there was a particularly high-profile theft of farm animals and a high-profile investigation afterwards.  In the Portlaoise area recently, in conjunction with garda&iacute; from Kilkenny, a major crime gang was disrupted, arrested and its members are currently before the courts.  In the Cahir area a large number of machinery items were recovered.  Significant effort is put into fighting the theft of farm animals, goods, machinery etc.  Coupled with this are the significant ongoing crime prevention programmes and they will continue.  The committee has probably seen the advertisements for Crimestoppers, with the Irish Farmers Association putting up a substantial sum of money as a reward.  All these elements help reduce crime.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner has very correctly touched on an issue.  The theft of livestock causes concern about where the animals go and if they go into the food chain.  We are particularly conscious of that and work very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard.  My colleague, Dr. Singh, manages the public attitudes survey and he can outline how levels of concern and fear of crime vary between different areas.  Some people consider it a big problem at a national level but not at a local level.  The reality is it is not a huge problem at national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jack Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Farm crime is an area we have examined in our research and analysis.  It is not just looking at livestock but also at other factors, such as theft of tools.  Tools are the main items being stolen from farms, along with diesel.  We have been putting together information to support plans in those rural areas.  We have also been monitoring TheftStop, which is showing some very positive benefits in the areas where it has been rolled out.  The reductions in theft are at a higher level than in other areas where TheftStop has not been rolled out.<\/p> <p>  Taking a step back, a positive aspect is that looking at farm theft for the first six months of year, there has been a reduction of approximately 40% from the same period last year.  That mirrors some of the other reductions that have been occurring in terms of property crime, and it is driven by activities such as Operation Thor.  To some extent, this is also mirrored in people's perceptions.  We run the public attitudes survey and we ask people about their perceptions of crime.  When we ask people about perception of crime in rural areas, they see it as a concern.  It is interesting that when we ask them what it is like in their local area, the concern drops.  There is no difference in the perceptions of crime in the local area between rural and urban areas.  There is some concern but it seems to lie at the national level, so it is a wee bit more nuanced than just general fear of crime.  It is almost layered.

We are taking no more questions.  I will hold my thanks to immediately after this but, at the closure and given that some members concentrated on particular areas of what I emphasise again is public concern while others of us dealt with issues of structural accountability and corporate areas, it is important to reflect that the views expressed and concerns voiced were shared by many as a result of what we know through the media.  I have never met - he is my constituent, I understand - Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  I have never met the man.  When I say that I can understand and empathise with colleagues' questioning and their concerns, that is because we are all informed by what we read and what we are hearing through the broadcast media.<\/p> <p>  I will share with the Commissioner that, even though we are talking about a small number, I am mindful that the reality of the situation is that one of those who now is one of that small number could very well in an earlier situation have been part of her panel here today.  That is the truth.  I am speaking specifically in respect of the superintendent, Mr. Taylor, who I do not know but who is the former Garda press officer.  The report of Mr. John Barrett, who was the head of human resources, was presented to the T&aacute;naiste just a little over a month ago, I understand.  These are people in substantial positions.  There is unquestionably a huge need to have all of this properly addressed.<\/p> <p>  I will close by saying that I sincerely hope - I am not across the detail of it personally - that Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill's terms of reference allow him to pursue, to seek and to secure all of the information that is relevant to the task that he has been set and that we get to a resolution of these matters at the earliest possible time.  That is in the interest of something that Ms O'Sullivan gave a welcome voice to in her opening remarks.  What I believe would be the wish of the overwhelming number of, if not all, serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that we have a 21st century police service that is deserving of public confidence and has the full respect necessary for all of its serving members.<\/p> <p>  I will commend the Garda Commissioner on one last point.  Nowhere in her contribution, either written or orally, today did she refer to a \"force\".  I have also commended Ms Josephine Feehily on her choice of language.  The people of this State - of this island of Ireland - want to see a policing service and I very much welcome Ms O'Sullivan's commitment to that.  On behalf of the committee, I thank her and each of her colleagues - Garda members and civilian members of the team across the board - for appearing before us and wish them all well in their collective responsibility in ensuring that we have a well-served society and that all the matters that they are to address are done so properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#S00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>May I make a point of clarification about the Chairman's round-up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1476259200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016101200002#S00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476259200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank him for his remarks.

I just want to make sure that the committee knows during this meeting that we are more than just a Leader company delivering the Leader programme.  We are delivering the SICAP funding programme and are also involved in many other European projects.  What we have been doing in the last number of years - we have been around since 1991 - has been about developing greater partnerships on the ground on an inter-agency basis with the communities to effect change and to realise projects which are in tandem with delivering on the objectives set out in the County Roscommon local economic community plan.<\/p><p>I will give the committee a flavour of a few of the initiatives in which we are involved.  Under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme 2015-2017, SICAP, which concentrates on the most socially disadvantaged in the county, we have the rural men's initiative, which has been active since 2004.  It is a good example of how the men in question have grown in confidence and taken on their own actions.  By giving them proper resources, they devise their own plans.  They recently wrote a book, a biography of their lives and their heritage, particularly in terms of the small farming community.  It is an asset for preserving that heritage.  We are also involved in delivering the Roscommon age-friendly strategy, the care and repair scheme and the trusted tradesmen initiative.  In this way, we are delivering many actions for the older population.  County Roscommon has a large population in that regard.<br\/><br\/>We have piloted and completed a training programme for the farming community.  We have five rural locations throughout the county and, from our work on the ground, are finding out the community's needs.  For example, there is a significant need for the farming community to be upskilled in order to ensure that people avail of all subsidies and farm properly.  Many people in County Roscommon are happy farming, but they want to ensure that they are doing it in the most efficient way possible.  We have set up an interagency group with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc, Bank of Ireland, the IFA, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA.  The pilot programme was a success.  It was based on broadband provision.  Broadband provision in all rural areas is a priority and is our recommendation for this committee.<br\/><br\/>County Roscommon has vibrant communities and great local leadership through local development companies and the county council.  All that we need now is resources so that the communities can, linked with State agencies, solve their own problems.  From our work on the ground, we have found ourselves to be the link between various agencies and supports at a local level.  Without this vital link, many people in rural areas do not know how to access the right support schemes.  There are many support schemes and Government initiatives, but without a local enabler, rural areas will not benefit from them.<br\/><br\/>Another example of an initiative in which we are involved is the Frenchpark integrated youth and community space.  It is a youth space and one-stop-shop, with all services being delivered in the community centre and responding to young people's needs.  Services are centrally located in a rural community.  The community resource centre in Ballaghaderreen is a one-stop-shop for the jobs club, Leader, mental health associations, the lakes and legends tourism initiative and older people's services.  It is centrally located and embedded in the community, with resources targeted on local needs.  We have a third level participation graduate retention programme.  Under the local economic community plan for Roscommon, the Roscommon Leader partnership is charged with finding a local solution for graduate retention.  It is a major issue in the county.  We have the second highest number of graduates, but they are not returning to the county.  By linking with third level institutes and employers and providing an IT solution for graduates in terms of a skills register and dedicated training, we are making headway in this area.  We have become successful enough in another European project to bring it to the next level.<br\/><br\/>We are involved in the EU's ERASMUS+ programme, which helps communities to achieve their objectives.  Under this, we are involved in the Creative Communities Igniting Change project, of which I have an example with me; the Food Incubators Transforming Regions project, which is to build a food centre of excellence in Castlerea, County Roscommon; and Youth Enterprise through the Arts, which is to upskill youth workers so that they can support entrepreneurship and creativity in their youth and early intervention activities.  The solution for rural employment issues is not just multinational companies.  Self-employment opportunities are key.  The sooner one builds and fosters that environment in a county, the better.  We also have a young community mediators project and a mainstreaming student entrepreneurship project, which takes the third level retention project to the next step.<br\/><br\/>I will cite a practical example of how these projects are effecting change.  Ballaghaderreen has been designated the town team, with local activists deciding to concentrate on building creative industries, showing the creative sector free work space and asking it to relocate to that area.  In conjunction with this, we have developed specialised training through our European project partners to support the sector in taking up that work space.  We have also linked up with GMIT, which provides the sector with progression to education, and the local enterprise office supports it with mentoring.  In short, a disused work space in Ballaghaderreen is free to entrepreneurs to take up for a year and, hopefully, they will set up businesses in the town.  It is a proactive attempt by a community to invite enterprises to the area and to tell them that it is open for business, has disused space and wants to meet them half way.<br\/><br\/>These are just some examples of our projects.  It is important to have strategic investments in our region.  Specific regional infrastructure is needed.  We have a great resource on our boundaries in the third level institutes.  They possess considerable knowledge and research, but there needs to be a connection with rural areas in order that the institutes' research and development, learning and innovation can be brought out of urban areas and linked with employers in our county so that there can be new enterprise in rural areas.<br\/><br\/>Decentralisation has been great for our area.  The decentralisation of public services should be a priority.  The Leader budget has been cut.  We will recommend that, as was previously the case, the CL&Aacute;R programme should match Leader funding and increase the budget for our area, which successfully built community-based key infrastructural projects previously.  The &euro;200,000 cap on <i>de minimis<\/i>aid under the Leader programme will prove a barrier to key strategic investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Earley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

We appreciate it.<\/p> <p>  I will provide some information on South Kerry Development Partnership.  We are a community-led local development company.  Founded in 1991, we were one of the first area-based partnership companies to be established by the Government under the auspices of the then Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP.  Our strength is that we work with local communities - we are out on the ground.  Our strategies and related actions are developed locally with local ownership and in response to local needs.  This bottom-up approach to rural development is a core ethos of the SKDP and guides and informs the development and implementation of all of our actions.  We work to promote and assist the development of sustainable and vibrant communities and to improve the quality of life of people living in south Kerry through the provision of social and economic opportunities.<\/p> <p>  I will give a snapshot of our activity in 2015.  We provided advice, guidance and mentoring to more than 300 unemployed individuals interested in self-employment and supported 150 of them in establishing their own enterprises.  Through our local employment service, we assisted almost 1,400 unemployed individuals with a range of labour market activation supports and progressed 883 individuals into employment, CE schemes, T&uacute;s and further education and training.  We supported 857 individuals in accessing the range of services provided by our jobs club service and progressed 106 directly into employment.<\/p><p>We provided enterprise-led training to over 100 enterprises across south Kerry through our Skillnets training network, and we providing well over 3,000 training days and funded almost 700 trainees.<br\/><br\/>Working through the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s, we supported over 250 community projects with valuable labour resources.  Utilising community development approaches, targeted supports and interagency collaboration, we have worked with over 400 individuals and 30 community groups from marginalised target groups or disadvantaged areas on a one-to-one basis to promote social inclusion and equality and improve the life chances of those who are marginalised, living in poverty or unemployed.  We supported the development and maintenance of important recreational infrastructure through the administration of the walks scheme on the national waymarked ways, the Kerry Way, the Kerry sections of the Beara Way and a number of community looped walks.<br\/><br\/>In my submission to the committee, I inserted a number of maps to highlight some of the challenges facing south Kerry.  The maps cover the percentage change in population, elderly dependency, population density and average farm standard output.  The challenges facing south Kerry can be summarised by saying it is a rural peripheral area with a declining population due to outward migration and emigration.  It has a weak demographic structure and an older age profile, there is a low population density, economic opportunities are very much confined to tourism and farming, low input and output farming predominates, and there are a number of infrastructural deficits, including in respect of broadband and mobile phone coverage.  The area has also seen the loss of a significant number of public services.<br\/><br\/>In 2013, we teamed up with Mary Immaculate College, University of Limerick, through Dr. Brendan O'Keeffe, to undertake comprehensive research on rural vibrancy.  Why?  Writing in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on 13 August 2015, Professor Cathal O'Donoghue, then head of Teagasc's rural economy and development programme noted that vibrant communities can, with local leadership, do a lot for themselves to make their areas better places to live in.  He stated that this vibrancy is a critical building block of rural economic development and that, without it, it will be hard to attract businesses and visitors.  In the research, we were very interested to ascertain the views of those at the coalface, the community leaders, the community and voluntary sector and individuals.  We examined public service provision.  Much of the international literature on rural vibrancy points to a strong link with services.  It is necessary to be able to access services.<br\/><br\/>The findings are interesting and provide a signpost to us all on how we can sustain viable rural communities.  The research findings show civil society is increasingly active in the provision of local services, particularly social services.  Community and voluntary groups are generally well organised and have increasing levels of skills and the proven ability to deliver projects efficiently and effectively.  Investment in community development delivers public goods and needs to be prioritised.  The animation, capacity-building and funding provided by South Kerry Development Partnership have been, and are integral to, the development of communities and the promotion of rural vibrancy.<br\/><br\/>Community groups are under increased pressures as they endeavour to fill gaps caused by centralisation.  Such pressures are increasingly unsustainable and have been exacerbated by funding cutbacks, not least the cuts that led to the loss of key personnel from South Kerry Development Partnership.  These cuts need to be reversed and the surrounding supports need to be reinstated and strengthened.<br\/><br\/>The increased bureaucratisation of the way in which publicly funded programmes, including Leader and the social inclusion and community activation programme, operate is perceived by the community and voluntary sector as a barrier to innovation and the attainment of vibrant community development.  Programmes need to be administered in a more common-sense manner, with an appropriate balance between the need for public accountability and efficient delivery.<br\/><br\/>In order to maintain and increase their levels of dynamism and their capacity to &quot;do development and democracy&quot;, community and voluntary groups need to become more inclusive and representative of younger people and those who have moved to south Kerry, especially those who have come from Poland, Lithuania and central Europe generally.  Public service provision in most of south Kerry falls below the 2002 target levels specified in the national spatial strategy and it is essential that rural service provision be underpinned by specific measures in the forthcoming national planning framework.  Areas with the weakest levels of public service provision, most notably Iveragh, need to be prioritised in the safeguarding of existing services and in the rolling out of new services, particularly broadband.<br\/><br\/>While levels of social capital and socio-cultural vibrancy are high in most communities, voluntary groups and the delivery of local services are under pressure from the contraction of the local economy, particularly outside of Killarney.  Thus, there is a need for renewed and ongoing investment in economic diversification, the provision of more public service jobs and the development of the SME sector.  Rural communities are the main economic base of the towns, and the development of these towns is best achieved and sustained by rural-urban collaboration and the building up of vibrant rural communities.<br\/><br\/>How can rural vibrancy and sustainable development be enhanced and better promoted?  From our experience and what the research is telling us, we make a number of recommendations.  First, there needs to be greater acknowledgment of volunteerism and promotion of community development and active citizenship.  Volunteers are the backbone of many communities and perform important service-provision functions and are significant generators of local economic development.  That said, they face challenges in filling gaps, particularly as State services are scaled back and reorganised.  Meanwhile, the wider economic restructuring of rural territories is limiting their ability to meet some new and emerging challenges.  These observations on civil society, as supported by data presented in Dr. Brendan O'Keeffe's report, can also be made in respect of many communes and municipalities in other regions throughout north-western Europe.  Community-led development works and local leadership and citizen participation need to be supported and facilitated.<br\/><br\/>In continental north west Europe, local level bodies, such as French communes, with an average population of 1,700, enjoy constitutional protection and legal guarantees.  In Ireland, by contrast, the work of civil society often goes under the radar of the public consciousness and the national media, and policy-makers can be inclined to take volunteers for granted.  This needs to change.<br\/><br\/>We need tailored approaches to local conditions, needs and potential.  The Report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas notes that rural areas are increasingly diverse, and that there are distinct spatial patterns and different capacities evident throughout.  Therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach should not be the way public policy goes.  It needs to be tailored for specific geographies.  The delineation of municipal districts at sub-county level represents a positive element of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 as it brings local government closer to the citizen, thereby opening the potential for greater transparency and subsidiarity.  In the case of south Kerry, however, the south and west municipal district is one of the largest and most diverse in Ireland.  It has limited internal public transport services and its boundaries were drawn without due consultation with local citizens.<br\/><br\/>Rural development is a public good.  Several OECD studies and the Report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas itself present considerable evidence in favour of strategic investments in rural areas.  Such investments need to be targeted towards the most vulnerable areas to redress the growing gap between core and peripheral regions and territories.  Dr. Brendan O'Keeffe notes the following in his study:<\/p><blockquote>Experiences from Germany, Scandinavia, and indeed the CL&Aacute;R initiative in Ireland, point to the merits that can arise from prioritising key strategic investments in peripheral locations, rather than 'waiting' for a trickle-down' effect from urban centres.  Specifically, within South Kerry, towns demonstrate a reliance on the purchasing power of those who live in the surrounding rural communities and on the environmental goods, services and economic activities associated with South Kerry's outstanding landscape. Thus, instead of expecting rural South Kerry to benefit from some kind of urban spill-over, it is recommended instead, that initiatives such as REDZ (Rural Economic Development Zones) take a holistic approach that enables parallel investments in both town and countryside.<\/blockquote><p>On promoting public service provision, the international literature on the issue of rural vibrancy demonstrates the link between vibrancy and public service provision.  In south Kerry as a whole, the towns and villages offer 75% of the recommended range of services for settlements of their size and this is much lower for more rural parts.  While the centralisation and cutback of public services may save the Government in the short term, considerable damage done as a result of inter-regional imbalances, growing income inequality, increased levels of isolation and mental ill health will prove costly in the medium to long term.  The vibrancy report outlines the clear message that &quot;now that the economy is beginning to show signs of recovery at national level, service provision must be restored to pre-recession levels, and investment needs to be accelerated so that all communities in South Kerry attain the service provision targets specified for them in the National Spatial Strategy&quot;.<br\/><br\/>With regard to reducing bureaucratic burdens, the report reveals strong support by local communities for South Kerry Development Partnership and the Leader and partnership approaches to development.  Given the important role local development companies play in stimulating local economic development and leading community development, these companies should allocated increased funding and given greater autonomy to make decisions about the allocation and distribution of rural and local development funds.  Recent local government reforms have limited the autonomy of local development companies and in some instances have resulted in their removal from the delivery of Leader in their areas completely.  These decisions need to be reversed.Cuts to Leader and to community development are having a disabling effect on the capacity of the community and voluntary sector and are exacerbating the gap between the core and a growing rural periphery, while also compounding social exclusion.<\/p><p>As an example, in the previous round of Leader funding between 2007 and 2013, during the worst economic crisis in the history of the State, the final spend on the programme was approximately &euro;370 million nationally.  The budget allocation in the current round of Leader funding is between &euro;220 million and &euro;250 million, a reduction of 40%.  In County Kerry the budget reduction is greater than 50%.<br\/><br\/>The rural social scheme which has done much to support service delivery in rural communities has not seen an increase in the national allocation of 2,600 places in the past ten years.  We are delighted, therefore, that 500 new places were announced in the Budget Statement yesterday.<br\/><br\/>The south Kerry rural vibrancy report stated:<\/p><blockquote>The work of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, and many of the experts cited in literature reviews demonstrates that the current recession and austerity agenda have had a more adverse effect on rural communities than on most urban areas.  The data presented show that rural economic development is integral to the ability of civil society organisations to grow their membership and foster social, knowledge and cultural capital.  Therefore, there is a symbiotic relationship between the economic and the social.  Investment in the rural economy is necessary for community development, while communities that are socially vibrant and have a high-quality natural environment are more likely to attract and sustain investment and generate prosperity.  Therefore, it is recommended that the upcoming Leader programme be delivered in concert with all area-based initiatives, including SICAP, the social inclusion and community activation programme, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme, the national walks scheme, EU LIFE, INTERREG projects and all social inclusion programmes, using community-led approaches, so as to enable south Kerry to capitalise on the complementarity between the dimensions of sustainable development - economic, socio-cultural and environmental.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Ian Dempsey and Mr. John O'Brien of the West Cork Development Partnership to make their opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#L00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476262800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>We welcome the opportunity to inform the work of the joint committee.  Mr. O'Brien and I have worked in local development in west Cork for the past 25 years.  It initially started out with the introduction of the Leader programme.  We have been around since the early days and know the particular visioning for the Leader programme which arose from the MacSharry CAP reforms.  We are likely to take a different approach from our colleagues because our perspective is somewhat different.<\/p> <p>  Our written statement aims to offer some reflections on what the past 25 years tell us about rural development.  It is a policy in which many of these issues need to be addressed.  There is a need for strong institutional capacity for organisations.  It is important to consider which are the local development companies on the ground, what they represent, what their capability is, their visioning, track record and accountability for public funds, etc.  We need to look at the skills and competences of everyone working at local level within companies and the broader stakeholders with whom they engage.  Having the necessary skills means that they are multifaceted in their ability to leverage economic opportunities to achieve community development and deliver exceptional outcomes with limited public funds in the overall context of local development.<\/p> <p>  Every rural area will make an argument for meeting its economic development needs.  One matter which needs to be considered is that the opportunity in leveraging optimum economic advantage in any rural area differs.  When we talk about supports and strategies to do this, they are not uniform.  The solution we seek in west Cork, as distinct from County Donegal or County Offaly, needs to accommodate that thinking.  We need place-based transformation agendas.  Every rural area is working from a different set of opportunities and there is no one single solution.  We waste our time and money in chasing that issue.<\/p> <p>  In our work in the past 25 years we have worked strongly internationally.  One of the reasons for this is the work on which we have delivered, particularly in economic development, has been recognised and lauded internationally in the United States and across Europe.  We have worked extensively in that space and there has been much interest in our work in that time.  On smart specialisation principles, people will be aware of them in the context of Europe 2020, in terms of exemplary work on place-based branding such as the Fuchsia brand and in the use of technology.  We have been working in these spaces for a long time with considerable success.  We now find, based on our experience, that our role in rural development will come to an end at the end of this month.  We will be working abroad.  That tells us a lot about policy in Ireland.  We are in a really interesting transition in rural areas.  If we look at the policy which informs it, there has not been a White Paper on rural development since 1993.  Accordingly, we are without a roadmap in what we are all, collectively and individually, trying to achieve.  A White Paper should offer a framework and a coherent policy context for what we are all, collectively, trying to achieve.  We look at a policy, under the guise of community-led local development, whereby the Leader programme in rural Dublin, important though it might be, has a budget that is one third higher than it is in somewhere like west Cork.  Somebody hides behind a policy context and claims the social, economic and community development needs of Kilternan or St. Margaret's are far in excess of those in a peripheral area such as west Cork which is 200 miles from the capital.  Members will be familiar with Brian &Oacute; Nuall&aacute;in-Flann O'Brien who was an exceptional chronicler of many of the absurdities of Irish life.  If he were to look at rural development policy today, he would say, as he did many times before, that it was a fierce pancake.<\/p> <p>  Some might choose to disagree, but many of the achievements of the past 25 years in the country were achieved in spite of policy and on the backs of people, particularly those working voluntarily, both in community and economic work, at local level.  They have been delivered in spite of the absence of a coherent policy.  The greater thinking on rural development in Ireland comes from the European Union and its vision of rural development and the Leader programme.  Rural development is a far bigger issue than the Leader programme.  However, we are entering choppy waters without a map.<\/p> <p>  It is incredibly timely that the committee has chosen to focus on this issue.  Those of us living in rural areas, in particular, will understand the importance of these issues and why we need to do much better than we have before.  Rural areas are dynamic and characterised by constant change.  All of us, collectively, as practitioners, policymakers, public representatives and agency workers, have to adapt to change and help to shape it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Dempsey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476262800,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I have been involved in various guises in the West Cork Development Partnership since 1991.  I joined as a young farmer representative, but, as committee members can see, I am no longer a young farmer.  I have seen the growth and change in the dynamic of rural development in the past 25 years.  It is a multiagency approach, involving the SICAP, the rural social scheme, T&uacute;s, the national walks scheme and others.  It is about many organisations, supports, sources of help and handholding based around rural development.  The Leader programme was integral to all of this.  It grew out of the bottom-up approach, as outlined in Ray MacSharry's report in 1991 on CAP reform.  The approach was that communities would feed into the dynamic and it grew from there.  We have had many successes during the years.  We have been lauded throughout Europe and worldwide as a successful deliverer of the Leader programme.<\/p><p>Can I say with bitter experience that we will now be delivering a Leader programme in Georgia and Russia, but we are no longer doing so in west Cork?  The tremendous staff in west Cork have 130 years of collective experience.  They have sweated blood over many years, but in the past week they have been thrown under the bus.<\/p><p> The non-adherence to corporate governance and employment law we have witnessed is a sight to behold.  I warn everybody who is involved in rural development to be careful because it is a horrible place for us to be at the moment.  As chairman of a board, I am dealing with staff who have been given three weeks to leave their offices.  They are not even being given the courtesy of eight weeks.  We will not be paid our final instalment of funding if we do not fill the boxes.  No one can deny that the tremendous rural development experience in west Cork is ending awfully.  There is an unfortunate dynamic as a result of a change in policy on the part of the past Government.<\/p><p> I would like to talk about the losses that will be suffered in the west Cork area from a rural development perspective.  Of course we will continue the rural social scheme, the T&uacute;s scheme and the other schemes.  All of those schemes grew out of the dynamic that was in play with Leader and the other rural development programmes.  Leader was the mothership and the mothership is dead.  I accept that there will be a mothership delivered from somewhere else.  From what I can gather, it will be delivered from Mitchelstown, Midleton and Bere Island.  The dynamic that has been in evidence at the offices in Bantry and Clonakilty, which have been delivering for the west Cork area, is dead and buried, unfortunately.<\/p><p> I will say one more thing about Leader.  We are now in our fourth Leader programme.  The stop-start approach to Leader is most unhelpful.  When one finishes a Leader programme, one has to gasp for air for a year, a year and a half or two years while a new programme is initiated.  Communities can lose the will to live during the lead-in period for funding projects and getting them up and running.  They have to be fed their life energy again so they can get going.  All sorts of projects come at them as they trundle along.  Funding is withdrawn from some projects and given to other people who do not spend it.  We have spent 100% of our funding through the years, but we have got little thanks.<\/p><p> I am sorry if I sound emotional about this issue, but I am emotional about it.  There is a case study in west Cork in how to destroy a community and how to destroy rural development.  Of course we will be told that rural development is going to be delivered by the local community development committees and everything will be hunky-dory and whoopadee-doodah.  I wonder about that.  I think there is a major lesson to be learned by Ireland Inc. in this regard.  We are going to tell the story.  Members are probably aware that the EU is investigating parts of what has happened.  We will see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>There is a lot of food for thought in Mr. O'Brien's presentation.

It seems to me that we are looking at two major issues here today.  One specific issue relates to Leader companies and the new construct whereby one company in one area is delivering all the programmes, including the T&uacute;s scheme, the rural social scheme and the social inclusion and community activation programme, as it was previously designed.  Rather than the companies being stand-alone entities, the local community development committees are involved in many counties.<\/p><p>I will ask a number of questions about Leader.  Would the witnesses have preferred if the previous arrangement had continued in this Leader programme?  In other words, is it better if one company in any given area delivers all the programmes, including the social inclusion and community activation programme, the Leader programme, the T&uacute;s programme and the rural social scheme?  That is a very clear and specific question.  My second question relates to whether the boundaries should have been left as they were before, unless there was a request from a local community to change a boundary.<\/p><p>I would also like to ask about the role of the Leader programme in industrial and business development.  Do all the companies have a view on whether the maximum grant of &euro;200,000 is sufficient to create significant employment in an area?  Having worked in industrial development in rural areas for many years, I am aware that &euro;200,000 would not wet one's tongue if one was setting up a serious business.  What is the view of the witnesses about the Department's decision to limit the grant aid for community non-profit projects to &euro;200,000, rather than &euro;500,000 as was the case previously?  The <i>de minimis<\/i>European ruling is a problem in the case of industrial projects.

Do we need a planning process that is friendlier to the development of industries and those living in rural areas, particularly those outside towns and villages?  In the provision of infrastructure such as broadband, roads, water services, sewerage and so on, what are the top three priorities?  Is a speed of 30 Mbps sufficient or should we be aiming to provide for fibre connection, that is, a speed of 1 Gbps, in every house and home in the country?<\/p><p> Has any of the groups carried out a study of the impact of decentralisation on their region?  For example, there is a decentralised departmental office in County Kerry dealing with the arts and sport.  Do the delegates know what the impact has been on the distance travelled by people to their jobs?  In other words, what has been the impact on the region as opposed to the town of Killarney?  That question is important because, unfairly, decentralisation got a bad press.  It was one of the best things we ever did and should do more of it, but I am interested in hearing the delegates views on it. <\/p><p> How great is the added burden of bureaucracy not only in the delegates' businesses as Leader companies but also generally in every scheme that is meant to be helping development?  How much has it become a barrier?  In other words, I giveth with one hand and taketh with the other.  Are the delegates of the view that that is how it is working?<\/p><p> What needs to be done to reach the full potential of rural recreational and tourism facilities and the activity suite we were trying to develop in rural areas as a possible good employer? <\/p><p> Do the delegates see a role for major companies and employers in rural areas?  I am thinking of FEXCO in Cork and McHale in Ballinrobe.  There are fantastic employers.  Should the approach to development in rural Ireland just involve micro-industries or is there a role for large, resource-based industries?  Should we be going for big as well as small companies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#M00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>The delegates have two minutes in which to answer those questions.

There are people the length and breadth of the country whose heads are wrecked by it.  It is not user-friendly and is for larger boats.  Whether the Department with responsibility for the marine wants to hear it, the country is built on small boats engaged in inshore fishing.  There is no point talking about it here because it would take an entire debate to sort it out, but the kilowatt and tonnage system and the quota system need to be far more user-friendly to enable traditional inshore craft which operate up to ten, 15 or 20 miles out to be given the tonnage required under Irish law to operate.

Everyone knows that the Leader groups have delivered greatly for people in their areas during the years.  There is no doubt about this.  As the gentleman from County Kerry was saying, there will be an extra 500 rural social scheme workers following yesterday's announcement in the budget, which is good news.  It might only mean a small number in each area, but it is a move in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  I will put a few questions to which the delegates might reply.  Unfortunately, some schools on the islands are closing due to falling population.<\/p><p>The islanders have been strong, especially the ones I represent in west Cork, about getting a chaperone or somebody else on board the ferry to take the children from the island to the school and back.  They have been in contact with the Department.  Perhaps it is not fair to put that to Mr. Dempsey because the Minister should probably answer the question.  Has that been acceded to?  It has been advanced frequently.<br\/><br\/>Many people had an input into what they are doing but the most astonishing news for me as a public representative of Cork South-West is that West Cork Development Partnership, WCDP, will cease over the next few weeks.  Both Mr. Dempsey and Mr. O'Brien were passionate in their presentation.  It leaves a large number of questions for my constituency, which has been savaged by cuts in the past few years, including the loss of Garda stations, post offices and banks.  However, we thought there was a recovery and now WCDP is being taken from us, which is the probably the biggest blow to west Cork for as long as I have been around.  I cannot find answers to the many questions this leaves.  The committee will have to find them going forward because someone has made decisions and we have not been informed over the past number of months why they were made.<br\/><br\/>The first kick that west Cork took was the cut of &euro;2.4 million in the partnership's budget three years ago.  What was the reason for that?  Where did the money go?  The latest kick is to take it out of business altogether.  The partnership was looked on as one of the best groups to roll out the previous programme but this time it and Comhairle na nOile&aacute;n are the only groups that are not allowed the new programme.  Who was involved in making the decision?  The European Commission is now questioning the decision.  I am passionate about this and if the Commission is questioning this, the committee should be looking for answers.  If we do not get them, the committee will not function at all.  Somebody has made a decision along the line and we need answers.The Commission commended WCDP and other groups and they have been asked to look at the roll-out of a similar programme in Georgia but the State does not see fit to ask them to roll out anything, even though they were voted the No. 1 group for the roll-out of the previous programme.  Something has gone wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it.  This involves European money.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and <i>The Southern Star<\/i>have reported that the Commission is launching an investigation into a decision made two weeks ago to take WCDP out of business.

Mr. Collins mentioned the islands as having lost out.  That is not quite the case.  It is even more absurd than that, if members could imagine such a scenario.  The islands are involved in delivering some of the Leader programme in west Cork but not on home territory.  George Orwell at his finest could not do this but that is what policy is giving us.  The Deputy is correct.  I have to be careful what I say because our experience in terms of the selection process for Leader has been deeply troubling and that brought us to make a specific complaint about one element of that to the Commission.  That has been reported in the media and, therefore, members can go and look at what that was.  However, the issue does not rest there.  I might just leave it at that.<\/p> <p>  The specific nature of the inquiry has been reported in the media and it is not an inquiry into us but into what has brought us to the position that we are in.  Dare I say that that is policy.  That will follow its own course.  I do not know when it will happen, how long it will take or even what it will say but it will go to the heart of many of the issues that have been touched on today.  The challenge for everybody in this process, whether they are practitioners, policy makers or public representatives, is to achieve the best outcome with the public moneys available to them and to be accountable for them.  That is all I will say on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred specifically to a budget cut of &euro;2.4 million and I understand other groups who are present were subject to cuts at that time.  That arose in 2014 following an embargo placed on Leader funding for five months.  I am at a loss to understand why the Department needed to place an embargo on the funding but that is what happened.  That has an effect on the beneficiaries who are looking for support, whether they are engaged in enterprise or community development.  When the embargo was lifted on 20 May 2013, we got an e-mail saying we were getting a budget cut of &euro;2.4 million with no basis for that at a time we had &euro;8 million worth of projects from potential applicants in the system.  I say \"at that time\" because that was our fourth Leader programme and we had never failed to deliver them in full, based on the strategic thinking that was important at that time.  It was never explained to us but that money went elsewhere around the country.<\/p> <p>  I would be loth to mention the areas but that money, in some cases, was never spent.  Deputy Collins knows many of the individuals and communities who lost out in west Cork at the time.  This is giving a sense of what happened in the previous programme.  If we cannot get the Leader programme right, which is a key instrument in delivering development at local level, we have fundamental issues.  I concede and recognise that the problems in rural areas cannot be addressed by Leader alone but if the primary tool for doing it is so deeply flawed and dysfunctional, we have a problem.  I could talk about this all day but the committee would probably welcome that I did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Is the selection process referred to by Mr. Dempsey the tendering process that was undertaken or was it a post-tender process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#O00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476262800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>It was not technically a tender process in the sense of public procurement and so on.

I will not speak about the money for a moment.  This committee should play a role in a proper evaluation on how things are being done under the local authorities.  I am talking about the mistake of bringing all of them into the scope of local authorities under the all-powerful might of the chief executive officers.<\/p> <p>  The Leader model in Ireland was one of best practice, recognised throughout Europe because it fulfilled the subsidiarity role that runs through all the European projects and the way it built capacity in communities.  It built capacity in individuals, families and whole communities for a number of years, until it started to be interfered with.  I will refer to the work that has been done throughout the country with the Leader projects and the national Rural Development Programme.  I do not know who saw it fit to change the model so that it would come under the structure of the local authorities.  Hundreds of people gathered around the country and packed out halls because of this.  I attended several of those meetings.  The ordinary people on the ground - the volunteers and those who had worked for years - pleaded with the Department and specifically those who were making the decisions not to go down their intended route under the local community development committees, LCDCs.<\/p> <p>  We have succeeded in creating a bureaucratic nightmare in the delivery of Leader when we had an excellent programme.  It will not build capacity in people and it will add extra burdens to volunteers.  It is wrong that it creates a dependency culture.  The purpose of Leader was about building capacity and independent and single-minded communities.  It is designed now to bring it in under the political system, create a dependency and have political interference in the decisions being made, and that is grossly wrong.  It is something that this committee needs to keep a very close watch on in the duration of what is being done.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues.

That is causing real problems for us as well in the likes of Mayo.  I work within these communities and they have spent several years putting together all these strategically important projects.  They have waited for Leader and some of the projects cost between &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million.  Having a cap of &euro;200,000 and then saying it cannot be matched with sports partnership, for example, causes a nightmare for people.  I can foresee cases where money will not be spent because of these blockages.  Do the witnesses have any solutions as to how that can be addressed?  It is cited in the way budgets have been cut.  Between 2007 and 2013, during the worst economic crisis, we had way more money in Leader programmes than we do now.  Mayo has been trying to operate with &euro;9 million less than it had in the previous programme, with fewer staff on the ground to work with the communities that need extra help.  That is where the focus should be and the areas that should be targeted.  They are not able to do their jobs.  Yesterday's announcement in the budget for extra Leader funding runs hollow for me.

I thank the witnesses for outlining some of them today.  There was a real and important role for local authorities in this new Leader programme.  We had transnational projects in which they could have played a role, ensuring that models of best practice in projects were duplicated and we were not reinventing the wheel all the time.  It would have ensured that the best practice could have been transferred throughout the country and Europe.  There was also the potential for an advisory role.  There was not a role for having control over how Leader programmes are run.  I will certainly watch this very closely and I hope that even with the restrictions in the Leader programmes there can be some really good work.  I hope people will not have to try doing it with their hands tied behind their back.  The questions concern specific bureaucracy and how the witnesses think we can address issues like the cap on Leader funding.<\/p> <p>  I cannot leave without saying the following.  We are in an area in Erris in Mayo that was left without a Leader programme for many years.  We are one of the most deprived areas in the country and we were left without that because of a decision made by the Government before the last one.  It decided to amalgamate all the companies within the Gaeltacht under Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teo.  We suffered because of those governance mistakes and were left without any Leader funding.  That is unforgivable and must not be let happen again.  We cannot catch up.<\/p><p>It is no longer acceptable for rural Ireland to be left with the crumbs from the table.  We want what we deserve.  We do not want EU funding targeted to areas where there is not deprivation and need - as has happened in respect of some of these projects - but rather to the areas that have been neglected and left behind.

As a local action group, we work with the local community development committee.  The current structure of Leader is such that, from the point of expression of interest to the issuing of a contract for funding, it can take between six to eight months for a project to be approved.  In my view, it is ridiculous that a small community group or a small enterprise in a rural area looking for funding has to wait between six and eight months for a decision in that regard.  One of the contributing factors in this regard is the manner in which Article 48 checks, which are an EU requirement, are carried out.  It has been decided to centralise this process, which involves three checks, to Pobal.  This mean staff in my office will have to scan files and send them to Pobal for checking, which strikes me as very inefficient.  This could be rectified and the timeframe reduced by allowing the Leader groups to carry out the checks.  If there are problems within certain companies in terms of doing those checks they should be addressed individually with those companies.  The answer is not to implement a system across the board which imposes a high level of bureaucracy on everyone.

This was an important provision of the previous Leader programme that allowed for co-financing by CL&Aacute;R and Leader.  Many of our strategic investments were co-financed through the Leader-CL&Aacute;R vehicle.  The &euro;200,000 mentioned is not sufficient to support the level of investment required in identified areas.  The de minimis rule is being misinterpreted and it needs to be broadened out.  Previously a derogation was available in the agriculture area such that if the area identified was food-related <i>de minimis<\/i>did not apply.  It is about affecting trade.  In other words, if it can be proven that a project will not affect trade within a locality, then it should be supported.  The Leader programme needs additional funding.  The CL&Aacute;R programme, with Leader, should be targeted at the most deprived rural areas.<br\/><br\/>On the local economic community plan, LECP, and the local community development plan, LCDC, in Roscommon we are working well with the LCDC and the LECP but we do not see that as being mutually exclusive.  We would still support the autonomy of the Leader company but we see merit in joined-up thinking and everybody working together under a local economic community plan.<br\/><br\/>Decentralisation in terms of Roscommon has been very effective.  The Department of Social Protection now has offices in Carrick-on-Shannon, as does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Land Registry.  This is affecting business in small towns positively.  A study in this regard would be welcome.  The benefits of this decentralisation are very evident to the people living in the county.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the planning rules, we believe there is a need for farm families to be prioritised in terms of locating on the family farm because that second generation has to look after older members of the family.  There is a need for the preservation of the rural farm family.  The policy of the local county councillors appears to be to direct people to locate in towns but this is not meeting the needs of the farming community.<br\/><br\/>According to the community enterprise review this year, very few regional rural projects in terms of community enterprise centres were funded this year, with most projects being located in larger urban areas.  Again, the policy appears to be to direct projects to where there is a critical mass.  What is being done by the Departments and the agencies to address the rural imbalance to ensure that a higher level of investment and support in rural areas?  We were very disappointed with the number of enterprise supported projects in our area.<br\/><br\/>On bureaucracy, if I am required to do more administrative work, then I have less time for development work and less time to go after European funding or to progress delivery of actions on the local economic plan.  On recreational tourism, there were greater co-operation in this area under the last Leader programme.  We visited the West Cork Partnership because it is a model in terms of Leader.  We learned a great deal from the partnership in regard to recreation and food which we brought back to our area.  I would like to see co-operation in this area prioritised.  We need to learn from the good areas in terms of commercialisation and to then replicate that in other counties.  This should be a focus of the new programme.<br\/><br\/>In regard to macro-companies, we have a lot of good companies in our area.  They are happy to be in the area because they have a loyal workforce and very good support from the local authority.  What they want is a vibrant community.  Quality of life and local services are priority issues.  Companies are happy to locate in rural areas where there are local services and vibrant communities because they know they will have access to a loyal workforce.  Some of our companies have been around for over 25 years.  I agree that what micro-companies as well as macro-companies are important.

The roll-out of the walks scheme has been a great success.  A farming organisation representative has put it to me that it is the only scheme he has seen rolled out to farmers that has been a great success.  Only now are we seeing it getting back on track and it needs to get back on track fast.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to greenways.  As part of the greenway initiative in south Kerry farmers receive a maintenance payment.  It is the same when it comes to working on rivers in south Kerry.  We will be travelling to Athlone on Friday to look at locally-led environmental schemes.  We see this as something on which the partnership should be leading.  The issue is how we manage rivers from a recreational and a farming point of view.  Eight catchments have been selected, three of which happen to be in south Kerry.  We will be looking for partners from west Galway and Mayo to join us and hope to make some contacts today.<\/p> <p>  We intend to make a bid to operate the new programmes.  As soon as the bad weather arrives, sheep always move off the hill.  If organisations take programmes from us, we need to move on to the next.  Ideally, the locally-led environmental schemes should be run by the local partnerships.  The KerryLIFE project being rolled out in south Kerry demonstrates how this can be done.  Although there are some issues on the project, we still believe local people are the best to deliver river catchment management plans for anglers, farmers and recreational users.<\/p> <p>  There are similarities in all of the programmes.  We brought forward a proposal on the walks scheme.  We are keen to see the issues of indemnity and insurance being brought to a head, finalised and agreed.<\/p> <p>  I manage the rural social scheme in south Kerry where a total of 500 places were allocated.  We have that many places available on the farm assist scheme.  Why has it taken 12 years to provide the extra places?  Having 500 places available is welcome.  I have no wish to be negative today, but the money involved was saved and taken from people's wages.  The funding is in place to fund the 500 places.  Surely there can be 500 places available again next year and 500 the year after that to put people to work in communities to replace the services that have been taken away.  Examples include bus drivers heading towards the Black Valley, staff in child care services, people working in community cr&egrave;ches or to develop new walkways.  We are keen to link the Kerry Way and the Dingle Way and many more walking routes in south Kerry, but to do this we need to see a further roll-out of the rural social scheme.  Why was farm assist payment the only payment to be cut in recent budgets?  Why have the farmers who were removed from the social inclusion and community activation programme been brought back in by way of low-income family payments?  Why did it take so long for these changes to materialise?  The rural social scheme and the walks scheme are successful.  They did not fall into disuse under previous Governments.  Why has it taken ten or 12 years to see any movement in the numbers of places available?<\/p> <p>  There is room for small enterprises in rural Ireland, but there must be room for big enterprises in rural Ireland also.  FEXCO is based in Killorglin in south Kerry, but the company decentralised to Cahersiveen which provided an extraordinary boost for that town because of the availability of office space and workers there.  Wood chip boilers have been installed in Astellas.  Meanwhile, up the road the Department of Education and Skills built has two new schools, but locally produced wood chip cannot be burned in the school in Miltown.  There is a facility in Beaufort.  We put a plan together for the St. Mary of the Angels campus which could have saved &euro;800,000 if a wood chip boiler had been installed, but those involved were unable to do so and now the facility is threatened with closure because it is not economic.  An important hospital was built in Kenmare.  Again, it could be burning locally produced wood chip.  We would like to see big industries such as Liebherr flourishing in south Kerry.  There are other examples such as Dairymaster in north Kerry.  There is plenty of room for large-scale employers in rural Ireland.  If we are to keep our population, we need a spread of work opportunities.  It cannot be a matter of providing jobs in tourism or farming only.  Some people will still want to work in industry, commercial services and banking.  South Kerry cannot rely on tourism alone.  As I grew up in a bed and breakfast house, I know what it is like.<\/p><p>It is the icing on the cake, not the full cake.  There is a long winter there and we need our universities to be linked into rural Ireland.  We need an opportunity where one can leave school in rural Ireland, get a degree in rural development and return to work in rural Ireland.  Why was the degree in rural development operated by UCD and UCC cut out of the Leader programme?  How can companies survive and get staff if people do not have the qualifications in rural development?  These young people need to be able to leave school in rural Ireland, obtain further education in how to set up a business in rural Ireland and develop the tools to return to rural Ireland.  That needs to happen and this committee would be well advised to look into that field.<br\/><br\/>The T&uacute;s initiative has been very important to us and we would like to see it continued.  We would like to see people with disabilities being allowed to join the T&uacute;s initiative.  We will be going to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine later this evening to sign a contract on social farming and would like to see our own partnership companies nationally operating social farming everywhere whereby they would give opportunities to people with special needs to come out and work on farms.  A neighbour of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae was covered in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>last week.  He gives an opportunity to a young man to come and work on his farm one day a week.  We have 27 people like that out working on farms and want every partnership in the country to do the same.<br\/><br\/>As the weather gets bad and sheep move away on the hill, we need to do the same.  If people want to take programmes off us and think they are better than us at doing it, we know they will probably be coming back in time and knocking on the door.  We will leave the door open, but the important thing here is the need for us to be innovative and to look for new opportunities at all times.  It is very important that partnerships co-operate with each other.  We should defend each other at all times.  What has gone on has been very disappointing but we need to rise above it and move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph McCrohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Everyone will have an opportunity to speak because there are plenty more questioners to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#T00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476262800,"counter":576,"content":"<p>In relation to innovation, South Kerry Development Partnership has been to the fore in the last number of years in targeting other sources of funding for rural regions, in particular through the EU-funded INTERREG programmes.  Under the current round of funding alone, approximately &euro;650 million is available in just three schemes.  One is talking about the INTERREG 5B programme, Atlantic areas and the peripheral regions programmes.  There is substantial funding out there but we are being hampered.  It is an accident in a way because we were always creative in how we came up with the matched-funding element.  We have a very experienced CEO here who was always to the fore in coming up with creative ways to match funding.  However, part of the funding we used to use will be under the local community development programme and that funding is now under SICAP and there is a European element gone into it.  As such, we cannot use that funding in any shape or form as a source of matched funding for any of the transnational programmes.  Therefore, we are left in a little bit of a limbo.  There is a solution, however.  It is a solution that many other countries in the programmes have put in place.  It involves the creation of a matched-funding programme for such initiatives.  It is something that could be funding either through ring-fencing lottery funding or through the dormant accounts scheme.  One is not talking about substantial amounts of funding, but if the country is to achieve its maximum input in terms of access to European projects, one is talking potentially about &euro;2 million per year from Irish matched-funding sources to access &euro;10 million, plus, in EU-funded projects.  The other advantage, which is significant at the moment given the Brexit situation, is that the programmes allow us to establish contact with partners in similar regions in other European countries.  That enables small companies, farmers and tourism sources to build contacts and look at new markets and opportunities and new ways of doing things.  As such, there are substantial benefits to be got from taking part in these programmes.<\/p> <p>  A very simple move in terms of creating some sort of matched-funding opportunity for the likes of the partnerships to be able to go out there and access that funding would be very welcome and would greatly benefit rural communities.  In terms of management, it is simply managed.  There is no need for additional bureaucracy.  One has the Southern Regional Assembly which is the auditor of the vast majority of these programmes in Ireland and it is already doing the paperwork.  The assembly would be fully supportive of the putting in place of such a programme.  It is something that could be made available relatively quickly.<\/p> <p>  The other point is around policy.  It was mentioned earlier that policy tends to limit opportunities in rural regions.  There is nowhere that comes to the fore more than in the area of energy.  It is not all about rural areas looking for handouts or supports from Government, it is about enabling rural communities to derive sources of income for themselves and develop social enterprises.  One area that could be tapped into is one we have seen in rural communities throughout Europe and that is renewable and sustainable energy.  Many of those resources exist in rural areas but because of the particular issue in Ireland of access to the grid, there is no way in the world that communities that want to start energy co-operatives to put in, for example, a 2.5 MW wind turbine can proceed.  They are simply not in a position to compete with commercial interests in terms of accessing grid connection.  Therefore, substantial objections are made in many instances to private companies coming to rural areas to put up renewable energy assets where the income goes straight out of those communities.<\/p> <p>  There is no reason communities cannot be enabled to set up properly governed and structured energy co-operatives to allow them to exploit energy resources for themselves while keeping the income in rural areas.  That would provide those communities with the opportunity to undertake proper forward planning in circumstances where they would know they had an income stream coming down the line.  However, that takes a decision at policy level to say that a particular portion of the available grid connectivity will be ring-fenced and made available for genuine community projects.  I am involved in an EU initiative which is at stage 2 in terms of an INTERREG project which is looking at providing the resources to put those co-operatives in place, structure them and develop a community-owned energy co-operative in the south Kerry region.  That model could be replicated nationally.  We are basing it on the learnings we have seen from other European countries and the opportunities available there.  There are a number of opportunities which could assist us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n de Buitl&eacute;ar"},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>That is very interesting.

I welcome the witnesses.  I have known Mr. Beades and Ms Earley for a while.  RSS, which all of the witnesses have spoken about, is one of the most successful schemes in the country.  It is welcome that 500 places have been announced, but we need to move on and up the ante in terms of the number of places.  I am a firm believer that is no good to pay someone at home if he or she can be doing some good out in the community.  That is the way forward.<\/p> <p>  In the T&uacute;s and community employment schemes, it has got to the point that one does not know where to ring.  One does not know who is handling things.  There could be two or three bodies handling the matter about which one is calling.  We need to do some tying up in that respect because it is all over the shop.  Any Deputy might ring one place and be told to ring another.  It is different in every county as Deputies who cover more than one will have found.<\/p> <p>  Some counties have towns teams and then we have the rural regeneration.  Some local authorities have opted to pick five or six particular towns.  This is not to begrudge any of them, but I have a feeling that the money is being sent to those towns while forgetting about other areas in a county.  Where a Leader group has money for a playground for children, that can also be done under regeneration.  Where is the joined-up thinking?  Is there any or are the witnesses being given a certain group of things to deal with?  I welcome the witnesses from Galway and ask them the following.<\/p><p>Am I correct in stating that there have been problems in the past year and that there will be a court case?  Would it be fair to say that Galway will probably not have Leader funding for 18 months to two years?  Would it be fair to say that with all the rigmarole that has gone on about Leader in the past two years in County Roscommon, it will be May before the people who have their tongues out for trying to get things off the ground can draw down money?  For two and a half years they have been going around the world and back again.  Rural communities need to go forward and create employment and that is not happening.<\/p><p> Mr. Noel Spillane mentioned the duplication of paperwork.  What percentage of the total funding for the programme is spent on each group or individual doing their bit to make it foolproof?  He said that one would swear it was forensic accounting.<\/p><p> I know the Burren in County Clare worked on a locally led scheme.  I think the Department still handles that.  But there may be an opportunity for different groups to use this model.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made the point earlier what it takes for business to get off the ground and he mentioned the McHales of Mayo.  They set up this iconic business in a small shed years ago.  There is a great deal of manufacturing in the west.  I am aware of the serious problems that must be overcome to get planning permission in Galway as 80% of the land west of the Corrib is designated lands.  Is this stalling enterprises from getting projects off the ground on that side of Galway?  Do all the small and medium sized businesses availing of Leader funding meet up as a group, or meet the representatives of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to see what they are doing or is everybody at present heading off in their own direction?<\/p><p> On tourism - and this is my final question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#T00500","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>The Deputy has four minutes remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#U00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>-----there is significant potential for tourism in the west but we need people with new ideas on the ground.

That is the alignment process, but what we should be looking to achieve is that all stakeholders work together towards a common end, using the resources - money and everything - else in the most effective and optimal way possible.  That does not happen in my view.  I can only offer a personal view - based on 25 years experience - that alignment is badly needed at policy level in Government and in the Departments.  The Departments do not talk to each other.  The problem is seen at implementation level, where groups are seen as duplicating supports and are tripping over themselves trying to address issues to which Deputy Fitzmaurice has referred to a degree.  The alignment at policy and Department level does not work.  I have seen very little evidence of it working over the years.  All the things that are fundamental to rural Ireland - agriculture, enterprise, community development, energy, communications, etc. - are not aligned.  That goes to the heart of many of the issues.<\/p> <p>  Rural recreation has been mentioned a number of times.   Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is due great credit for his work over many years in ministerial office and is a really good example of what happens when one looks at working with all stakeholders in a space.  The then Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v recognised the landowner as the key stakeholder in rural recreation and with Comhairle na Tuaithe was able to bring them into the process.  A hell of a lot has been achieved off quite minimal amounts of public money to do that and the benefits throughout the country are evident for all to see.  Let that be an example of you have to do in order to achieve.  Let us see the same thing happen in respect of economic development.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  We worked with them and I am sure others have, but one does it because of personal relationships, one can access them or they recognise that your group is valid in that space.  That does not happen half enough.  So much gets lost for that reason alone.<\/p> <p>  I will now revert to the questions Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked at the outset.  He asked whether the previous arrangements should be continued?  The answer is yes and no.  The arrangements should be put in place now for Leader and other schemes to deliver the best possible outcome for the areas in question.

What happened in Galway is very complex, and, I presume, the same happened in Cork, given that we are in the same situation, to a certain degree.  We never sought hinterland in Cork, Mayo or anywhere.  We wanted the islands, like we had before and the time before that.  However, the system was enforced on us, and the only way to get the Cork islands was to get the hinterland with it.  It was the same in Mayo and Donegal.  In Galway, it was the whole county and we went in under the local community development committee, bells and all.  The award was given to a company that operates only in Connemara.  Now, the rest of Galway has to go back out there again.  It is ridiculous.  It is crucial to what has been mentioned already regarding the Leader process.  I would like to hear, as Deputy Michael Collins said earlier, the answers to how these decisions were arrived at and what backs them up.

I worked as a manager of a partnership company in Connemara, and the Connemara examples typify what has been wrong with the development of the sector during the past ten years.  From day one, it has been a smash and grab by the county managers on the Leader funds.  For years, they have been eyeing up the Leader money and politicians have rowed in behind them through the alignment and cohesion processes to bring us to where we are.  It has been a disaster.  It is ironic that the policy is called \"putting people first\", given that it has done the opposite.  It has put it upside-down.  The idea of the bottom-up mentality has been lost.  Although the local authorities hide behind a committee, they are in control of the funding and dictate where money will be spent.  It saves the local authorities money on projects they should have been spending money on but which they cut back on.<\/p> <p>  It is also very anti-democratic.  Some of the decisions mentioned today were not taken by the full committees but by four people who were part of a committee.  The irony is that the people who have expertise in rural development were excluded from the decision-making process on the committees given that they had a conflict of interest.  It is bonkers.  The people who knew most about where the money should be spent, the companies that were best to do it, how many lots there should be in a county, where the funding needed to go and where resources should be doubled up were excluded from the decision making.  It is nuts.  The people left in the room, in one case in Galway, were four people making a decision that affected everybody in the county.  In the case of the islands and the Galway scenario, the Department laid down one set of rules whereby there would be only one lot, and it was the whole county.  The companies that played to this agenda and applied under it were penalised for doing what they were asked to do.  The Department changed the goalposts in the middle of the evaluation process to exclude a company such as Comhar na nOile&aacute;n.  It is bonkers.  It is a disgrace and should be investigated.  I have said the islands should be a separate lot from the beginning.  It makes complete sense and the committee should recommend it.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the process over ten years, and taking the example of Rosmuc, where there was Cumas Teo and Pl&eacute;ar&aacute;ca Teo, which was a community development programme, CDP, we were forced into cohesion with Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG.  MFG was a disgrace.  I calculated that &euro;9 million was lost to Gaeltacht communities as a result of the demise and mismanagement of MFG.  We are talking about the checks and balances.  Where was the Department during the MFG debacle?  Where were the checks and balances in that company and in other situations around the country?  Other companies have been penalised due to the bad management in some companies.  Extra administrative burdens have been imposed on the entire sector rather than working with those which are doing it right and sorting out the basket cases.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the comments on privatisation of some of the services, which has recently arisen as an issue with us.  It is very difficult to get people on community employment, CE, schemes given that under social welfare schemes, a private company is going around snapping up people and taking them away from what would have been CE schemes.  This is just the tip of the iceberg, I imagine.<\/p> <p>  I do not buy into the idea of central oversight with Pobal overseeing it.  It does not make sense.  One has to devolve and allow local communities to decide what projects they want to bring forward.  The system should support them in doing what they want to do.  As Senator Rose Conway-Walsh said earlier, our Leader model was lauded as the best in Europe, but we have turned it upside down and probably turned it into one of the worst.<\/p> <p>  Recently, somebody came to me and said he wanted to establish a packaging company in Connemara.  He said he did not want to go to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta given that there was too much red tape and hassle and it would take too long, as he needed to make a decision quickly.  I did a trawl to see if there was any commercial space available outside &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, and I found one unit which was a garage.  Is a lack of commercial space for people who have suitable projects an issue across the rural areas?  The elephant in the room in many projects is designations, SSEs and development.  How significant an impact do the designations in different areas have on projects the witnesses are trying to help people to promote?<\/p> <p>  There has always been an element of co-funding of projects.  Are there any other thoughts on how we will co-fund?  When policy is implemented from the top down, there is no buy-in in the local area.  The development of initiatives such as greenways is being stifled because there is no local stakeholder buy-in.<\/p><p>Now that we have a local community development committee-led model, where we do not really have this stakeholder buy-in, how will we overcome this issue?  If we have a lovely lake in an area and we want to develop a walkway around it, we need all of the landowners in the area to buy into it.  How will we get it if they are not really involved in the process of making decisions?<\/p><p> With regard to energy projects, in Canada they had the type of model discussed, where community co-operatives were allowed to develop.  They were given a preferential tariff on the electricity they fed into the grid system.  They also got a very cheap connection to the grid when doing community projects.  They used tidal, wave and small wind energy projects.  Are there any other models out there that we know of like this which could be examined?  The Aran Islands would be very successful in the development of alternative energy.<\/p><p> Ba mhaith liom mo thaca&iacute;ocht ioml&aacute;n a thabhairt don ch&aacute;s at&aacute; Comhar na nOile&aacute;n ag d&eacute;anamh gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh na hoile&aacute;in ar fad faoi Chomhar na nOile&aacute;n agus faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Leader.

How were these decisions made at national level, that there would be one company in one county and three in another?  There does not seem to be any rationale coming forward to explain it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#V01000","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476262800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Regarding what Deputy Fitzmaurice said, planning is an issue.

I was waiting 20 years to get planning on a house across the road that I own myself, and I live on the island.  It was a house to do up for my son and it was an existing dwelling.  At the same time, the council built two houses on brand-new sites.  It could do what it wanted, but I could not do anything.  There is a huge discrepancy in how the planning law is actually put into practice in areas with a high designation.  This has consequences for the people who live there.

A good example is Valentia Island Lighthouse, which was opened by the community and had 15,000 visitors this summer.  This is a community project staffed by T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme working hand in hand.<\/p> <p>  What is dangerous and very confusing for everybody is to have the Gateway scheme, the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s schemes run by different organisations.  There are also projects run by the Department of Social Protection itself.  Let us hope the 500 new T&uacute;s and rural social scheme places are run by parish companies and not by another body coming in, as happened to the local employment service when JobPath came in.  JobPath is a very cruel instrument.  It tells unemployed people it will get them a job, but people are being sucked out of rural Ireland.  They are told they must move on Monday morning.  I have an example of a farmer's son who was unemployed and moved from Kerry to Cork Airport because there was a job there.  He was probably happy he got a job and we can all see the benefit of this, but this is a commercial company being paid a commercial rate to do this work.  We can see unemployed people being sucked out of rural areas rather than jobs being generated in rural areas which unemployed people could take up.  I have nothing in the wide earthly world against an unemployed person getting a job, and that is what they should do, but it is a dangerous tool.<\/p> <p>  With regard to joined up thinking, Mr. Dempsey spoke earlier about Departments needing to join up.  The budget is a dangerous instrument in the sense that every Minister looks for a pot of money and everybody works independently.  We now have a partnership Government.  It is ironic it wants to get rid of some of the partnerships when it is a partnership Government itself.  It is important there is joined up thinking.  We have a problem in Kerry at present where in one project in Waterville landowners and rural social scheme participants are clearing out the rivers to make fishing beds better for salmon, but across the hill in Glencar and Blackwater the farmers are told by the Department not to clear out the rivers and they are to be left alone.  Recently a track machine which was cleaning the drains was asked to leave the side of the road.  We know there is a way of doing it, but the officials need to write down the one, two, three, four or five steps that need to be taken when we are looking after river catchments in these designated areas.<\/p> <p>  Definitely when people's land becomes designated they get a whole lot of problems with it and a whole lot of headaches.  There is no other way of saying this.  A lady started an enterprise and she had to jump a lot of hoops to put in a proper sewage system for two or three employees in a unit at the back of the house.  All of her children, who have gone off to college, had been living in the house, but because there were workers this had to go in.  In fairness to the woman, she went through the process and it took a long time, but the people have their jobs now in a veterinary company working in a remote part of south Kerry.  It took a great individual to go through the red tape.  It was mentioned in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, that it will take a lot of strong people to revive rural Ireland.  The policies, Government and all of the agencies, including ourselves, must nurture these people, because we are being left with very few people to work with as people emigrate and depopulate and family sizes get smaller, and the ripple effect is serious for rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph McCrohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476262800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>The privatisation of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is very bad use of taxpayers' money.

This is exactly the benefit of having projects such as these.  We can learn directly from the experiences of those areas.  They are similar in nature to regions such as ours.  They suffer from depopulation and have many similar problems.  It is hard to believe the Netherlands has issues with depopulation in rural areas, but it does, and it is similar in Germany and France.  We can learn and benefit from their knowledge in establishing these co-operatives and seeing how they work and integrate.  They do not only get a feed-in tariff in the Netherlands, they are also in a position to be able to sell energy to their members, so they get two bites of the cherry.

The availability of commercial property must be looked at.  It must be done through communities.  If a commercial individual has a property through family circumstances anything can happen the property.  If IDA Ireland or other organisations have it, they might not have the same commitment or focus on the rural area.  In a project we are developing in Sneem at present, in conjunction with the local authority, the community is developing an enterprise space.  I hope it will attract enterprise.  If that enterprise decides to move on, the community will still own the space and can do the next thing with it.  If communities can own so many GAA pitches throughout the country, why can they not own enterprise units for their GAA players or other people in the community to work in?  Communities need to move away from purely community services.  They must move into community enterprises and creating jobs for their people.  The co-operative movement has been hugely beneficial to rural Ireland but it probably stopped approximately 25 years ago.  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will tell me exactly when.  There have not been many new co-operatives formed.  We formed the Ring of Kerry Quality Lamb Society Limited co-operative in recent years, where 23 sheep farmers directly sell their lamb.  It is very successful and has created seven jobs.  There could be many more of these in the country.<\/p><p>Farmers need assistance.  They need a target group to inform them of the various programmes that we are delivering.  They need an enterprise officer or an officer to meet them, to attend meetings at night, to work with them and to cajole them because they do not have a lot of money to invest and every step one takes needs to be done well and carefully.  We have an enterprise co-op and a transnational beef co-op.  We have a south Kerry beef replacement heifer co-op that is connected to the beef data and genomics programme.  It is amazing that the greatest take up of the beef data and genomics programme was in Caherciveen, which is the furthest away from Leinster House.

I apologise for missing part of the presentation because I had to participate in Leaders&rsquo; Questions.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the delegations here today.  I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations, particularly for outlining the work that they have done for the past years.  It is a pity that the Ministers who have the funding and make the decisions are not here to hear from the witnesses in order to understand what they have done, their abilities and capabilities and ability to continues to do things if they were left to do so.<\/p> <p>  I am disappointed that the Kerry Leader budget has been cut by 55%, which is a massive reduction.  It is very unfair that a bottom-up approach that successively operated for years has now been changed.  I am worried that the more urban places will benefit rather than rural areas.  The local authorities have plenty to do if they were given funding and allowed to do what they are supposed to be doing without becoming involved in the operation of the Leader project.  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses have outlined the many different schemes they have been involved in.  I thank the South Kerry Development Partnership in particular.  It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the North East Kerry Development and IRD Duhallow that have represented the people of Kerry and done wonderful work on their behalf for the past 25 years.  It would be criminal if anything happened to these organisations.  I am sad to hear that the organisations have lost some of their key personnel.  It is very unfortunate to lose people who have done so well and accumulated such knowledge over the years.  They can never be replaced.  It would be criminal to lose any of the current people in the organisations as they have so much knowledge. <\/p> <p>  The biggest problem at the minute is that the rivers are all blocked.  It was interesting to hear that work has been begun by the rural social scheme in south Kerry.  The witnesses have outlined how the clean up could and should be done.  The organisation is successfully carrying out such work even though it has been prevented from doing this work on the Glencar side.  I am amazed at such a development because I was involved in the building of roads there.  We worked practically along the Blackwater River yet we did not cause any damage.  There are ways of ensuring one does not damage anything.  It is about time that the people who are stopping it realise that methods can be used to successfully do what is needed - to unblock the rivers and let the water flow.  In Glenfask, 22 houses have been flooded and the national primary road has been flooded.  What has the NRA proposed to solve the matter?  It wants to raise the road.  The road and the houses did not sink.  Instead, the river rose higher and caused flooding.  I am interested in the scheme.  Can it be expanded into the eastern side of south Kerry?<\/p> <p>  I very much appreciate all of the schemes that are being operated by the organisations, especially the social farming scheme where people with disabilities are catered for.  I have seen how this scheme works at first hand when I visited Kilgarvan.<\/p> <p>  Ms Earley mentioned planning.  Sure, planning is a problem.  Four families located on the side of the national secondary road into Killarney have been refused planning permission.  There are 200 m of site distance but because of something that was inserted in legislation back in 2012 and signed into law by the then Minister, these people have been refused permission to come out on the national secondary road.  It is criminal that people willing to pay to put a roof over their heads have not been granted permission.  Kerry County Council gave approval but the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, lodged an appeal with An Bord Plean&aacute;la that subsequently refused permission.  The idea is that people buy a house in town but there are no houses to buy in Killarney and we know there is a housing crisis.   Let me give one example.  Liebherr first came to Killarney in 1958 and the great businessman Mackey O'Shea showed the company a site and put them into the field where they are today.  If Liebherr arrived today the company would be laughed out of the place as the site would be classified as a secondary amenity area.  Liebherr employs 1,000 people today.  Even if it were a new company that offered to employ 1,000 people the proposal would not be considered.  That is why the people who make the laws and ensure they are implemented should consider what they are doing because people and jobs come first.  If Killarney did not have those 1,000 jobs one could erect a gate at the county bounds and say Kerry is closed for business.<\/p> <p>   Agreement from landowners is important.  I am interested in the proposal that farmers should be allowed to clean up the rivers but be given a grant to do so.  For the past 20 years it has been deemed a criminal offence to touch the river and all of the landowners stayed away because they would lose their farm payments.  These are more regulations that have caused serious problems for us in Kerry.  The farmers have no problem with allowing rivers to be cleaned but it would be preferable if they were allowed do it themselves.<\/p> <p>  Agreement from landowners comes into play in another matter.  We have been told that Kerry County Council and the Department have insisted on using a compulsory purchase order to get around securing agreement by landowners for the siting of the greenway from Glenbeigh to Caherciveen.  The landowners have been given no consideration in this matter.  It is the first space in the country whereby a compulsory purchase order will be used to secure the land for the project.  That is the wrong way of doing things.  If Kerry County Council had interacted more and communities were given a chance to interact with the landowners we could have got full agreement and the greenway would be under way.  Now the courts are involved and I do not know where the matter will finish up.  I hope that it will finish and that we will have agreement because the greenway is important to the people of Caherciveen and the people of all of south Kerry.   I am very worried that this process may finish up in a negative way.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses very much and I am sorry Chairman for going on.  I am delighted that this committee has got the chance to hear the knowledge that these witnesses have and the positive effects they have had on Kerry and other counties over the past 20 years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#X00500","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Theachta.

The same needs to continue with all rural development projects where farmers have an input into the projects from the get go.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  If we continually lose people from the farming community, if they move away from the deeply rural areas those areas will be taken over by noxious weeds and forestry and various other things and will be denuded of people.  Once we lose people, once the lights go out in valleys it is very hard to switch them on again.  The rural development companies need to work more intensively with farmers and with Teagasc.  Teagasc staff numbers have been on hold for the past few years and the deeply rural areas do not have the level of service provided by Teagasc staff going to the houses to meet the farm families.  That is a role the rural development countries need to move in on, in conjunction with Teagasc and other State agencies, to keep as many families thriving and vibrant in those rural communities as possible.

There will be no beef industry in Ireland if the calves are not born.  They are born on the western seaboard.  One can talk about Brexit or beef barons but unless the man gets up in the morning to calve the cow there will be no beef industry.  There will be no beef industry on the east coast.  The resources are not being put into those farmers, those who have to get up in the middle of the night to calve the cows or to put the cow back in calf.  That has to be done too and she has to be checked to see is she ready to back in calf.  A lot of work needs to be done.  It is grand to say the farmer must have an off-farm job and I understand that but as Deputy Fitzmaurice said, a farmer needs to have three or four irons in the fire.  He cannot just be beef farming or suckling because he cannot depend on the Irish meat factories to make a living.  He will have to have the rural social scheme again.  He will have to have jobs at Enterprise, Fexco, Liebherr or wherever. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph McCrohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Has anybody spoken to the witnesses about the broadband roll-out in the new national broadband plan?

There are 1,000 people working in the West Cork technology park which evolved from the Leader programme.  Two years ago representatives from the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in West Cork to talk about the national broadband plan.  They were laughed out of it when they told the people attending that it was five years behind.  It was 21 or 22 at that time.  Somebody asked how we feel about the 30 megabytes.  There is nobody in my area, and I am sure it is the same in other rural areas, who thinks they will get that and that there will be universal service provision.  In any event, if it takes another six, seven or eight years the game has moved on.  We will have the same digital divide.  We are playing catch up all the time.  I know in isolated areas and in some urban areas fundamentally some very good things are happening.  It is a significant inhibitor and limiting factor to optimising economic development in many areas.<\/p> <p>  I want to return to a question Deputy Fitzmaurice raised about bureaucracy and whether anyone can quantify that.  I can do so.  In March of last year the Department invited me to go to Brussels to present on what it takes to achieve 100% compliance in programme delivery and accountability for public funds.  I did that and as part of the presentation we were asked to quantify what it takes in man or woman hours to deliver a project.  Irrespective of that project's scale, just working through the requirements to comply with the regulations, it takes 60 hours.  Whether the project was worth &euro;5,000 or &euro;500,000 the process in respect of checks and balances are fundamentally the same.  That is a working week and a half.

There were many lost opportunities and most areas around the country did not fund food projects because it was no longer a part of the core programme.  In quite a modest way we created 51 new jobs in the food sector in the last programme.  I am not interested in making any extravagant claims about job creation, there are plenty of others who do that.  I am talking about actual jobs, not ones expected in two and three years but ones that are there, that are developing and have gone further than that.

The idea behind the rural social scheme was exactly the same.  When I was around 20 years of age, my father-in-law explained to me how a scheme had been introduced by the Government to create work by opening bog roads and all sorts of things to supplement farm incomes.  It was the first big breakthrough for them and it stayed in my mind.  This is what inspired the rural social scheme.  The means-testing rules introduced for the rural social scheme work against couples.  Married couples only get &euro;20 more than the means-tested amount they would get through farm assist.  This is hugely regressive.  Why should anybody work 19 hours per week for &euro;20?<\/p> <p>  My final point highlights the challenges for islanders.  There are two islanders here today.  To get here in the morning, they had to leave the island last night.  That was one overnight stay.  We have kept them here so long today that I doubt whether Mr. Murray will reach Inishbofin before the last boat or whether Ms U&iacute; Mhaol&aacute;in will even make it to the boat at Ros a' Mh&iacute;l.  They will both, therefore, have a second overnight stay.  It must be recognised that if we want populations on the islands, we need to realise just how successful they are in overcoming incredible barriers of distance that are not so much physical in nature but which relate to services and that we cannot spare the effort to compensate for that.  I live in a very rural area but I can leave here at 10 p.m. and still get home.  I have often do so.  I have left here at 11 p.m. and gone home to Corr na M&oacute;na.  It is three hours hard driving but I can do it and arrive at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  If someone does not get off the mainland in the winter time at 5.30 p.m., that is it.  They are there until the next day.  I would like to nail it on the record.  It really highlights the challenges islanders face when I say that it takes two overnight stays to attend one Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#Z00900","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1476262800,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo mh&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as teacht anseo inniu.

There are also massive passions on this side of the table with regard to those.  It is also very clear that great work has been done by different groups in the past, that there is great dysfunction in the process and that the latter is leading to the lack of necessary services.  One of the main points I have taken from today's meeting is that there is an over-dependence in rural areas on a small number of sectors such as tourism and farming and that if there is a shock in those sectors, it means that those areas are over-exposed to those shocks and will be massively damaged by them in the future.<\/p> <p>  It is also very clear that there are a rake of opportunities that are not being harvested by the State in rural areas, for example, the fishing and renewable energy sectors or even place name branding.  The likes of the Aran Islands and all of those different locations are nearly brand names in their own right and these brand names could travel internationally as far as products are concerned.  There is also a shocking lack of connectivity among the Departments as they approach all of these issues.  This leads to disconnection in the delivery of services on a local level and a scatter gun effect.  Red tape and entrepreneurship in local areas are like oil and water.  The two of them do not mix.  If you want to scare off an entrepreneur, just bring red tape to them and they will quickly back off and not engage anymore.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that this debate between the committee and the witnesses is not over and we hope to continue it in the future.  Some of the witnesses have very short futures if things do not change radically, so we will do our best to see whether we can contact the Department, ask the questions and push to see whether matters can be resolved.  I thank all of the witnesses for attending.  Their information will form part of our report.  We will send an interim report to the Department in the next ten days, so this information will, hopefully, seep through into its thinking.  We have a few small issues to discuss as our witnesses leave so we will suspend the meeting for three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22016101200002#Z01000","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1476262800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.10 p.m. and resumed in private session at 2.15 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe joint committee adjourned at 2.30 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 26 October 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
