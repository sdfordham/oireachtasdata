The Air Corps provides air support and on occasion carries the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purposes of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking.   <\/p>  <p>  Internationally, the establishment in 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N) has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at the Centre in Lisbon.  Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force. <\/p>  <p>  The value of this cooperation both nationally and internationally in tackling large drug shipments at sea was highlighted in September last when an operation by members of the Task Force, supported by the EU Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre for Narcotics and other agencies, resulted in a highly successful drug interdiction operation off the south west coast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800057#WRA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800057#WRA04200"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[6897\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800057#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the resources deployed by the Irish Defence Forces in Afghanistan, including troop numbers; the missions they are engaged in; and details of the other forces with which they are co-operating.","asker":"1197","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>On 9 December 2014, the Government approved the participation of seven members of the Defence  Forces in the new NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, which commenced on 01 January 2015, following the withdrawal of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission from Afghanistan.<\/p>  <p>  Resolute Support Mission is a non-combat training and advisory mission.

The Deputy will be aware that on the 9th of December last the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly T.D., announced a 20 point Action Plan to tackle emergency and short term homelessness. The initiative in Dublin, supported by Civil Defence, was just one of a series of measures aimed at rapidly increasing the number of beds available for homeless people in the capital.<\/p>  <p>  Since the 12th December last, Dublin Civil Defence with the assistance of Civil Defence Volunteers from other counties, have been operating a temporary hostel at their premises at Wolfe Tone Quay. This provides overnight accommodation for up to 20 people. This facility also operated from January to March of last year, in support of the City Council&rsquo;s initiative to alleviate homelessness in the capital. Professional carers on contract to the City Council assist with the management of the homeless persons at the facility.

For example, in recent weeks Civil Defence Volunteers have assisted the Garda&iacute; in ten different searches for missing people including in your own county of Tipperary. Civil Defence volunteers also make themselves available, if required, to assist in dealing with flooding and the effects of severe weather. Thankfully this has been much less of an issue this year compared to the early part of 2014 when Civil Defence Volunteers were called out repeatedly to assist local authorities in dealing with the effects of severe weather.<\/p>  <p>  While Civil Defence is always willing to assist the community, homelessness by its nature is a complex issue and there are other agencies and groups, both statutory and voluntary, who specialise in dealing with the homeless.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that, under the Action Plan announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Mr. Alan Kelly, T.D., which involves all of the relevant agencies, the issue of homelessness in other areas of the country outside of Dublin will be comprehensively addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800058#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800058#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[6880\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800058#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if there have been discussions between his Department and the Departments of Justice and Equality and Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding the presence of foreign military aircraft in Irish territory, and the possible transportation of weapons and other lethal war materials in view of comments by the United States of America on the civil war in Ukraine; his plans for a more active role for personnel of the Irish Defence Forces in these matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland rests with the Minister for Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade in accordance with the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952.<\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing liaison between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality regarding security matters generally.

While employment has increased nationally by approximately 80,000 since the start of the Action Plan process in 2012, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery. That is why the Government is placing an increased emphasis on supporting jobs growth in the regions. <\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment develop and publish a suite of Regional Enterprise Strategies based on the strengths of each region, in consultation with key stakeholders.  Last week, the Government announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs-Regional initiative which will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of each region to support enterprise growth and job creation.   <\/p>  <p>  My objective is that six Regional Action Plans, including one for the Border region, will be launched by July, with two remaining Strategies in development at that stage. The Regional Action Plans will identify measures that can be taken to help each region to realise its economic potential, with a view to increasing the number of people at work in the region.  Consultation with local stakeholders will be an essential part of the process of developing the Regional Action Plans.  In that context, local entrepreneurs and business people will have an opportunity to provide inputs to the Action Plan for Jobs for the Border region.  <\/p>  <p>  In launching the Action Plan for Jobs-Regional initiative last week, I announced that new funding of up to &euro;250 million will be made available over the next five years to support job creation through enterprise growth in the regions.  This includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into the regions, and &euro;100 million to Enterprise Ireland to support indigenous enterprises to start up, grow and export. <\/p>  <p>  These funds will be distributed through three new competitive calls which will be announced by Enterprise Ireland over the coming months.  The first of these calls will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives, the second will focus on new ideas emerging from the Local Enterprise Offices and a third, broader, competitive regional call will support significant projects or initiatives to improve enterprise capability in the region.  Funding will be allocated to the best ideas across the regions.  Tangible jobs impact, enterprise start-up and scaling are amongst the criteria against which applications will be measured.  Innovative collaborations among different regional agencies or stakeholders will also be favourably weighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800062#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Enterprise Offices","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800062#WRF00450"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[7306\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800062#WRF00500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the budget and job creation targets for the local enterprise office in County Donegal for the years 2011 to 2014, inclusive; the targets for 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Donegal is the first-stop-shop for micro- and small-enterprise development within the County.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, &euro;18.5 million was allocated for County Enterprise Development and the same budget was allocated for 2015.

Since 2009, Ireland has been listed among the top 20 countries in global rankings for the quality of our scientific research.  We have excelled in certain fields: Ireland is now ranked 1st in the world for Immunology and Animal and Dairy, 3rd for Nanoscience, 4th in Computer Science and 6th for Materials Science.  <br\/><br\/>In 2013 SFI announced an investment of &euro;300 million over five years in seven world class SFI Research Centres in key strategic areas of importance to the economy. The &euro;200 million funding delivered through the SFI Research Centres Programme was complemented by over &euro;100 million in cash and in-kind contributions from over 150 industry partners, making it the largest ever combined state\/industry co-funding announcement of its kind in the research field in Ireland directly supporting over 800 jobs.  More recently on the 20th October 2014 a further five SFI Research Centres were announced, through a Government investment of &euro;155 million together with industry funding of &euro;90million. <br\/><br\/>The 12 SFI Research Centres have an investment of &euro;355million from Government through SFI and a further &euro;190 million from industry collaborators.  Over 200 companies are involved in collaborations with the centres.<br\/><br\/>The SFI Research Centres link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial research questions; foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies; attract industry that could make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy; and expand educational and career opportunities in Ireland in science and engineering.  The Centres promote and develop academia-industry partnerships which serve to provide industry-relevant training and contacts to the researchers.  <br\/><br\/>These 12 SFI Research Centres are focused on strategic areas of importance to Ireland - Pharma, Big Data, Medical Devices, Nanotechnology\/Materials, Marine Renewable Energy, Food for Health\/Functional Foods, Perinatal Research, Applied Geosciences, Software, Digital Content, Telecommunications and Medical Devices etc.<br\/><br\/>Through its investments <br\/><br\/>-SFI supports a cohort of circa 2,600 researchers across Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs. <br\/><br\/>-SFI continues to support Excellence and Impactful science with a significant component of its budget supporting researchers on grants.  It is important to note that while the number of researchers directly supported by SFI has declined slightly, SFI-funded researchers have leveraged significant other funding with the total composition of the research teams (both SFI and other funding sources) numbering 4,678 <br\/><br\/>-A total of 3,996 peer-reviewed publications were reported in 2013 by SFI funded researchers, of these 2,237 publications were attributed to SFI awards.  Publications and citations provide a key indicator of the excellence of the research funded.  Of the total number of publications from active award, 40% have an international co-author; this provides a strong basis for building partnerships for EU Horizon 2020 funding. <br\/><br\/>-SFI researchers were involved in over 900 linkages with industry involving links to 460 Multinational Corporation (MNCs) and 440 SMEs.<br\/><br\/>-SFI has built strategic partnerships with other agencies for collaborative funding initiatives, as part of the implementation of the NRPE through the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG). These include a partnership with Teagasc to fund projects in the Future Agri-Food space and a partnership with the Department of Education and Learning in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>-SFI was instrumental in the Smart Futures national campaign, promoting careers in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) to second-level students in Ireland. Continued support for the Smart Futures programme has come from industry representative bodies such as ICT Ireland, the Irish Software Association, Irish Medical Devices Association and Engineer&rsquo;s Ireland. A Smart Futures Advisory Forum has been established to provide strategic support for the implementation of the initiative.<br\/><br\/>-SFI researchers engaged in more than 1,383 international linkages with partners in 48 countries, and play a key role in enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international scientific reputation.<br\/><br\/>-SFI will continue its endeavours to promote and encourage research of Excellence and Impact. SFI&rsquo;s focus on excellence of research is critical to allow Ireland to continue to build an effective research base that will contribute to economic development. This SFI focus on excellence has enabled Ireland to markedly enhance its international scientific rankings, from 36th in 2003 to breaking into the global top 20 in 2009, a ranking which has been maintained every year since.<br\/><br\/>-The impact of basic scientific research is cumulative.  Primarily as a consequence of SFI support, Ireland excels in specific research disciplines, as seen clearly in rankings such as 1st for the quality of its research in Immunology and Animal &amp;amp; Dairy; 3rd In Nanoscience; 4th in Computer Science and 8th for the quality of its research in Materials Science.<br\/><br\/>-The Global Innovation Index 2013 ranked Ireland 10th out of 142 countries.<br\/><br\/>-In July 2013 Nature Magazine, the eminent scientific publishing journal, cited Ireland as one of 5 up-and-coming countries for research.<br\/><br\/><b>Table<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Funding to SFI from Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI)<br \/><br \/>&euro;&rsquo;000<\/th><th>Funding to SFI from other government departments\/agencies<br \/><br \/>&euro;&rsquo;000<\/th><th>Funding to SFI from EU Programmes<br \/><br \/>&euro;&rsquo;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2001<\/td><td>8,768<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2002<\/td><td>30,910<\/td><td><\/td><td>SFI was a unit under the aegis of Forf&aacute;s up to 2003 when it was established on a statutory basis under the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act, 2003.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2003<\/td><td>66,476<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>113,730<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>129,561<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>147,570<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>164,066<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>170,418<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>180,398<\/td><td><\/td><td>109<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>158,705<\/td><td>63<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>161,642<\/td><td>69<\/td><td>160<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>164,439<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>905<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>161,550<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>235<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>162,440<\/td><td>364<\/td><td>120<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>1,820,673<\/td><td>589<\/td><td>1,529<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800062#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800062#WRF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[7394\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800062#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a trade and investment agreement being negotiated between the EU and the US.

The main objective is to reduce or eliminate any unnecessary costs, for example, duplication of testing or inspection.  The EU Commission has put together a paper that provides an overview of the EU&rsquo;s position in the negotiations on regulatory co-operation and this can be found on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website at .  <br\/><br\/>In the area of public services, such as health and education, where there has been a lot of misinformation, it is important to point out that the agreement will not require any public service to be privatised.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the TTIP negotiations is to generate jobs and growth by reducing barriers to trade and investment. According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade, significant benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.  <br\/><br\/>My Department commissioned a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland. This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised shortly and published in early 2015.<br\/><br\/>The initial findings of the study show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; in certain services and in processed foods. Small and medium enterprises in Ireland are expected to gain from this trade agreement. <br\/><br\/>In accordance with EU&rsquo;s Common Commercial Policy, on the basis of a proposal from the EU Commission, it is a matter for the EU Council to decide on the signature of a trade agreement, and, following the consent of the European Parliament and ratification by Member States, to adopt the formal decision to conclude a trade agreement. This means that Ireland will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800062#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800063#WRG00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800063#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[7273\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800063#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their agri-environment options scheme payment for 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>The person named is an applicant under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme 2010.

It was a collaborative effort which has borne fruit, with Ireland being the first European country to regain access to the biggest beef market in the world.<\/p>  <p>  The US beef market is potentially lucrative, with consumption at 11 million metric tonnes annually, which makes this new market such an exciting one for Irish producers.  While grass fed is a small volume category compared to conventional or grain fed beef, currently accounting for approximately 10% of total volume, it is estimated to be growing at approximately 20%+ per annum.  Consumers in this segment of the market will be a key target in the marketing efforts to promote Irish beef.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I visited the US to launch the arrival of Irish beef there and hosted launch events in New York, Washington and Boston.  All of the major Irish beef exporters that accompanied me reported strong interest from US buyers and distributors, which I am sure will lead to further collaboration in the future.  I also had the opportunity to meet with many buyers and distributors and it was clear the superior taste and quality of Irish beef allied to the sustainability of its production clearly resonated with the US audience.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, last week Bord Bia unveiled their marketing strategy for Irish beef in the US having been actively preparing the groundwork for market entry.  Having this first-mover advantage as the first and only EU MS to achieve access to date is significant.  One of the key announcements last week was the launch of a dedicated website highlighting the qualities of Irish beef to US beef consumers and buyers.<\/p>  <p>  Currently just 2% of Irish beef exports go outside the EU each year and further diversifying the available markets has been a key element of my strategy for the beef sector for some time.  This is a key element in ensuring more sustainable returns to beef farmers and ensuring that an over-reliance on particular markets does not harm the long term prospects of the sector.

In Ireland, average prices rose steadily from &euro;3.22 a kilo at the start of January 2011 to an unprecedented peak of over &euro;4.40 per kilo in June of 2013.  They subsequently declined to &euro;3.51 in September of 2014 before recovering to the current price with tightened supplies of &euro;4.05 excluding VAT.  Prices are a function of normal supply and demand factors which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle, and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats, exchange rates and the overall macroeconomic situation.  Last year Irish processors slaughtered nearly 10% more animals than in 2013 and over 17% more than in 2012, while there has been a drop in beef consumption throughout Europe.<\/p>  <p>  There are structures in place to help to alleviate the impact of these price changes, and to help farmers to reduce production costs and increase efficiencies.  Successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy have involved a shift in emphasis from market supports to direct payments to farmers.  The &euro;1.2 billion per year secured in direct payments each year forms a constant and secure income for farmers, and this is a particularly important buffer as prices fluctuate.  In addition, the need to ensure a viable future for the beef sector has been central to the draft &euro;4 billion Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July.<\/p>  <p>  The RDP includes a number of elements which will be of benefit to beef farmers throughout the country, including the Beef Data and Genomics Programme which will be worth around &euro;300 million over a 6 year period and should bring about long term improvements to the sector though improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  Also, the continued support under the new agri-environment scheme GLAS and the &euro;195 million per year support for disadvantaged areas will be of significant benefit to beef farmers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Reducing input costs and improving efficiencies on farms has also been a key focus, and in this regard the funding by my Department to Teagasc, ICBF and Animal Health Ireland is critically important.  I have also been active in developing new market opportunities for Irish beef and in recent years markets such as, Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran have been opened.  In addition, I launched Irish beef on the lucrative US market last week and I am confident of further success in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that prices for R3 steers in Ireland have risen by 54 cents per kilo since the beginning of September.

The fourth annual report &ldquo; <i>Milestones for Success 2014<\/i>&rdquo;, published last September, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets.  Four and a half years into a 10 year strategy, the value of primary production has almost reached its target and export s have grown by 27% compared to its 2020 target of 42% growth.

Since September, average prices have risen by over 15% and now stand at &euro;4.05, exclusive of VAT, for R3 Steers.  This price is 5.5% higher than the same period last year and is also ahead of the same period in 2013, a year of exceptionally high prices for beef in Ireland.  With supply forecast to tighten in 2015, I would be hopeful that recent price rises will be sustained and that they can result in improved margins for beef producers.<br\/><br\/>Margins are, of course, also impacted by a number of factors other than price and these are the areas where I have focused my efforts since becoming Minister.  I established the Beef Roundtable last year in order to bring all stakeholders together and to facilitate open discussions between industry and farming organisations.  At the 4<sup>th<\/sup>meeting of the Roundtable in November, the stakeholders agreed to a broad range of outcomes which address areas of concern for the sector such as relate to product specifications, price transparency and quality payment system.<br\/><br\/>The Roundtable allows stakeholders to engage in a positive way on strategic goals for the sector.  As an example, the most recent meeting of the Roundtable held earlier this month resulted in the establishment of a stakeholder group, led by Teagasc, which was tasked with preparing written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or those considering developing bull beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will also be aware that I have provided for a package worth over &euro;70 million for the beef sector in 2015.  This includes &euro;52 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) which forms part of Ireland's draft Rural Development Programme, and will involve a budget of some &euro;300m over a 6-year period.  The proposed BDGP is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology.  This will help farmers to manage their enterprises in a sustainable way that is cognisant of Ireland's climate change commitments, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd.  It will also place Ireland at the global forefront in the application of genomics technology and cement our place as one of the most important and export focused beef producing nations in the world.<br\/><br\/>Of course, new market opportunities for both beef and live cattle exports also impact on the eventual returns to farmers.  The recent the opening of the US market to Irish beef is a major achievement in this regard and I am confident of delivering more markets in the coming months which will further improve prospects for the sector.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Sheepmeat<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The industry wide strategy for developing the sheep industry in Ireland was set out in the Food Harvest 2020 document which envisages a 20% increase in value terms of the sector by 2020.  My approach to building on the significant achievements of the strategy up until now is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland's market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2014, Irish sheep throughput at DAFM-approved plants was up slightly on 2013, with a marginal increase 1%.  Prices paid to producers over the same period have increased, with the average factory price running at 6.9 % of last year's level at the end of the year.  To date in 2015 there is a 5% drop in throughput at DAFM approved plants with an approximate 12% increase in the average factory price over the same period last year.<br\/><br\/>At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector.  During 2014, I announced the extension of the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) for a further year.  In committing funding of &euro;3m to the programme in 2015 I am acknowledging the success of the scheme in 2013 and 2014 in which 4,000 producers participated.<br\/><br\/>Support for the sheep sector has also come from the Grassland Sheep Scheme for which I have prioritised funding over the last five years.  This scheme delivered &euro;83 million directly to the incomes of Irish sheep farmers.  As it was not possible to implement the grassland payment under the new CAP regime I decided that payments received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme will be incorporated into the calculation of the entitlement value in each year of the new regime for those farmers who participated in that Scheme.  This will have the effect of increasing their entitlement value and ensure that such farmers do not lose through the cessation of the scheme at the end of 2014.<br\/><br\/>Under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the Knowledge Transfer measure which has a budget of &euro;100m.  The experience in STAP will inform the development of this measure.  In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and advisors in order to customise information exchange.  The Knowledge Transfer Programme for the sheep sector will be launched in 2016 when the current STAP concludes.<br\/><br\/>The current AEOS Scheme supports sheep farming through its commonage measure.  The proposed new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will also support, amongst others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes.  GLAS intends giving priority to those commonage farmers who come together to form an agreed plan to manage these valuable landscapes.  It also includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for all sheep farmers.<br\/><br\/>On the export front I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities.<br\/><br\/>During 2014, we have agreed veterinary health certificates with Lebanon, Namibia, Hong Kong and The Philippines thus allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat to those countries.  Also, during my visit to China leading a Trade Mission in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheep questionnaire which we had been asked to complete in connection with our efforts to gain access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat.  This represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat in the future.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Dairy<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>With respect to the dairy sector, Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the milk quota regime, on the basis that quotas were widely regarded as a brake on the potential of the Irish dairy sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  The ending of milk quota regime represents an exceptional opportunity for the dairy industry to increase milk output and, as a result, the industry has set itself a target, under Food Harvest 2020, of increasing milk production by 50% in the period to 2020.  This will result in increasing the 2008-2009 average annual milk production of 5bn litres to 7.5bn litres in 2020.  Consequently I am satisfied that dairy production in Ireland will not suffer in the aftermath of the abolition of quotas.  Furthermore, since the publication of the Food Harvest 2020 Report, my Department has been providing a range of supports to assist farmers in exploiting the potential for expansion and development.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding a softening market for dairy products on world markets towards the end of 2014 and the consequent reduction in farm gate prices for milk, the general consensus among forecasters in this area is that increasing global population and other demographic factors are expected to result in strong demand for milk and dairy products in developing countries.  Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this increased trade in the context of the removal of quota restrictions which will facilitate the necessary increased production.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Pigmeat<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services.  The sector accounts for 5% of the total agri-food sector and is the third largest individual component. In 2014 export volumes were up 7%, continuing the growth seen in previous years, while export values increased by 3%, constrained somewhat due to price pressures.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years.<br\/><br\/>Support is provided by my Department for the development of the pig sector in a number of ways.  Firstly I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;37 million allocated for 2015.  Among the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.<br\/><br\/>Other supports for development of the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards.  This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat.<br\/><br\/>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and helps expand its presence on EU and third country markets.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to report that overall Irish pigmeat exports in 2014 increased by 10%, to a value of &euro;570m.  Exports to Asia alone are estimated to have risen by 20% to China, 210% to Japan and 650% to South Korea.  International trade is expected to improve in 2015, reflecting the ongoing increase in demand in response to growing <i>per capita<\/i>wealth in China, and the redirection of pigmeat usually directed towards the Russian market to different locations such as South Korea and the Philippines.  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors.  In this regard I was pleased to recently announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which are already serving as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.<br\/><br\/>I am of course aware of the current price difficulties for Irish pig farmers and have met with farm organisations and processors on a number of occasions to discuss possible solutions to alleviate these difficulties.  I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in the EU to persuade the European Commission to come forward with market response measures in response to current price difficulties.  In addition my Department will continue to engage with the Russian authorities and with a view to lifting the pigmeat restriction as a priority.<br\/><br\/>It is important to remember that pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and this will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers, given our self-sufficiency.  In addition, the progress made in the last few years in establishing and consolidating a presence in important international markets will better position Irish producers to take advantage of growing demand.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Poultry<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Poultry meat has long been seen as a value for money food and this has underscored an increase in demand, particularly in recent years.  The sector has faced considerable challenges in recent years with rising input and energy costs combined with significant pressure from lower cost imports.  While input prices reduced somewhat in 2014, the beneficial impact of this was counterbalanced by reducing producer and wholesale prices.<br\/><br\/>Support is provided by my Department for the development of the poultry sector in a number of ways.  Provision is made through the RDP, TAMS II, for poultry investments.  In addition knowledge transfer groups will be established to optimise producer productivity and profitability in the poultry sector.<br\/><br\/>In terms of marketing supports, on a national level Quality Assurance plays a fundamental role in promoting food and horticulture and provides the platform for consumer promotion of product quality.  The primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry is the fresh retail trade where Irish product is still dominant.  The Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme (PQAS) is a very important instrument in that market and is recognised by consumers as a guarantee of traceability and reliability which is sought after by Irish retailers.<br\/><br\/>Ireland exports poultry meat to almost 40 international markets<b><\/b>and export values grew by an estimated 20% in 2014 to &euro;310 million, underpinned by strong growth in the export of processed products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800064#WRH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Development","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800064#WRH00350"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[7240\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800064#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he satisfied regarding the development of the fishing industry here, in the wake of revised European Union agreements, quotas and fishing practices; if he expects families dependent on the fishing industry to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing industry while supporting our families and communities that depend on the sea for their livelihood.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield).  This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  The new Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest.  As president of the Council during the CFP negotiations it fell to me to broker an agreement on this important issue between the co-legislators.  In line with the CFP, I consider that for some stocks we will need to phase in delivering MSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet.  The TACs and quotas for 2015, as agreed at the December Agriculture &amp;amp; Fisheries Council of Ministers meeting, take account of delivering MSY for 2015 where possible and on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of a landing obligation\/discarding ban on a phased basis, as set out in the CFP, represents a fundamental shift in fisheries policy and fishing practices.

This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800064#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[7241\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800064#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he is satisfied that the fishing industry here remains sufficiently competitive in terms of costs, as compared with its competitors from overseas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>The EU Commission published a report on the performance of fishing fleets in respect of 2012.  It reports higher market prices and the recovery of some fish stocks helped the EU fishing fleet to again improve its profitability in 2012.  It reports that despite the economic crisis and less fish being landed, economic performance has more than doubled over the last 5 years, from 3.2% net profit in 2008 to 6.6% in 2012.  These are some of the main findings of the 2014 annual economic report on the EU fishing fleet,produced by the JRC (Joint Research Centre, the European Commission's scientific and technical arm) and independent experts.<br\/><br\/>The report finds that although generated revenue fell compared to 2011, costs decreased even more, making a &euro;458 million net profit for the EU fleet, performing better than in 2011.  This improvement can be attributed to lower labour and capital costs, a steady reduction in fuel consumption, higher market prices for several commercially important species, such as European pilchard, anchovy and brown shrimp, the capacity reduction in some fleet segments, the implementation of long-term management plans and the recovery of some important fish stocks.<br\/><br\/>Research and innovation projects, implementation of certification schemes and the growing demand for certified products as well as favourable market conditions are some other factors that may also have led to an improved economic performance.<br\/><br\/>The EU Commission advises that this improvement occurred in spite of sustained high fuel prices and the ongoing economic crisis that continues to affect markets for some species and limit access to credit.  Other drivers that may have contributed to deteriorating performance include the reduced amount of fish that can be caught from several key stocks such as European sprat and Atlantic herring, severe weather conditions and, in some areas, damages caused by marine mammals, e.g. seals.<br\/><br\/>However, this overall positive evolution in 2012 did not apply to all fleets.  Of 18 analysed Member States, the report finds that three national fleets (Belgium, The Netherlands and Slovenia) made overall net losses and while the economic performance of the EU large-scale and distant water fleets generally improved over the period 2008-2012, that of the small-scale fleet declined from 13% in 2008 to 3.4% in 2012.

This Strategy, like its predecessor, will be developed by a Committee of leading figures from the agri-food sector.<br\/><br\/>Independent consultants are being engaged to carry out a full Environmental Assessment of the 2025 strategy to include both a SEA and AA, which when completed will inform future policy development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800065#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry Development","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800065#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[7248\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800065#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to outline the extent to which he sees scope for further development in the food ingredient sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>Long term global trends - population increases, urbanisation, a growing middle class and increasingly affluent new markets, particularly China and India and other Asian countries &ndash; are placing huge demands on world food resources and provide opportunities for food ingredients. Global trends in health and wellness, 'naturalness', nutritional awareness and convenience are also driving sophistication in recipe development and ingredient selection.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is well placed as we produce high quality, safe and sustainable ingredients. The dairy sector is gearing up to increase production by 50% by 2020 and value added ingredients can provide a market with less price volatility than commodity production. One major opportunity is supplying dairy ingredients to infant formula manufacturers. Exports of infant formula have increased by over 55% since 2010 to c. &euro;920m and there is further potential for growth as infant formula manufacturers increase their Irish manufacturing footprint. Market opportunities are also expanding for dairy powders and proteins, butter and cheese ingredients which are used in a very broad range of functional foods, clinical, paediatric and sports nutrition products.<\/p>  <p>  The prepared consumer foods sector is a major market for meat and dairy ingredients and there is a positive trend in demand for particular products and export markets.  The Irish food industry includes suppliers of ingredients such as micronutrient premixes, seasonings, brine and cure ingredients, prepared sauces, stocks, and marinades, baking aids, Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) meat and vegetable ingredients. These suppliers are developing new business in European and Middle Eastern markets.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also significant opportunity to develop new marine ingredient industries.  There is strong demand from international companies for sustainable, high quality marine ingredients such as oils, calcium and proteins as well as fish oil for direct human consumption. New supplies of marine ingredients may be found in underutilised species such as krill and boarfish.<\/p>  <p>  Market insight, manufacturing and R&amp;D capability will be key to growth. The development agencies and research bodies are working closely with food companies to facilitate this. On the market side, Bord Bia research into end users of dairy ingredients in world markets has provided insights for Irish companies seeking to expand their export footprint exporters. Promotion of Ireland as a leading source of sustainable dairy ingredients has increased awareness of what we have to offer.  Companies may avail of Bord Bia market insight services across sectors and also attend trade fairs such as Food Ingredients Europe which is taking place in Paris in December.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc Moorepark provides world class support in the dairy research area to companies exporting worldwide.  In strengthening their technical and product development capability, companies can and do leverage the capabilities of Teagasc and the Universities.<\/p>  <p>  Sustained growth requires targeted investment. Capital investment under the Dairy Fund, administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department, has been followed by further major investments in manufacturing capacity and capability, in many cases supported by Enterprise Ireland. Food for Health Ireland (FHI) and the Dairy Processing Technology Centre (DPTC), both supported by Enterprise Ireland, are focused on developing next generation dairy ingredients. The investment by Kerry Group in its Global Technology and Innovation Centre at Naas and R&amp;D initiatives by other food companies, highlight the potential for dairy ingredients. Initiatives in other sectors are under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, there is considerable scope for further development in the food ingredient area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800065#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Artisan Food Sector","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800065#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[7249\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800065#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to outline the extent to which he sees further scope for development and employment in the artisan food sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>The artisan or speciality food sector in Ireland was valued at c &euro;615 million in 2012, with some 350 producers employing more than 3,000 people.

The emergence of Ireland's artisan food sector, supported by growing consumer demand for niche products and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, has generated many new small food companies.

Artisan food also has potential to attract visitors and tourists as evidenced at Bloom and many food festivals.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy has stimulated the development of innovative programmes for the sector. These include Food Academy, a programme developed by Bord Bia, the Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves\/Supervalu to support small producers to build businesses, which has been particularly successful in generating sales and employment.

It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.  \t<\/p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.  \t<\/p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.<\/p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to the Child and Family Agency, at the end of September, 2014 there were 1,698 young people aged 18 to 23 years (inclusive) in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 946 (56 %) were in full time education.  <\/p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of children are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  <\/p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.<\/p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together local authorities, the HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.  The situation regarding the establishment of these committees varies nationally but, it is expected that all committees will be operational by mid-2015. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency's duty to satisfy itself as to the child's or young person's need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO00800"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[7278\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he is implementing a plain English policy, as outlined by the National Adult Literacy Agency, in his Department's communications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>It is the policy of my Department to ensure that the Department's publications are presented at a level of plain English commensurate with the specified audience which may include:<br\/><br\/>- Elected officials, Government Departments, policy makers, researchers and academics;<br\/><br\/>- Professionals working with and for children, for example, teachers, social workers, youth workers, child-care workers;<br\/><br\/>- Parents and general adult population;<br\/><br\/>- Children and young people.<br\/><br\/>A link to the website of the National Adult Literary Agency is on my Department's website www.dcya.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[7318\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the case of a child (details supplied) can be expedited for North Lee Early Intervention Team assessment as their parent and health professionals involved are concerned that early detection of potential Autistic Spectrum Disorder symptoms are critical to planning the best possible care plans.","asker":"1083","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

They are not political or Ministerial decisions. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. <\/p>  <p>   In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish health-care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <\/p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014. The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering. These engagements have been completed and the HSE is now considering the outcome of those commercial engagements. The HSE has also engaged with clinical experts and is considering the outcome of those engagements. Fampridine will be assessed along with a range of other applications for reimbursement of medicines for multiple sclerosis and other diseases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":371,"content":"<p>Question No. 134 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO02100"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[7198\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800070#WRO02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when persons (details supplied) in County Offaly will receive a decision on an application for a medical card.","asker":"1101","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

It assists the thyroid gland in making hormones which are important for growth, metabolism and for development of a baby's brain during pregnancy and early life.  Iodine is found in a range of foods, but the richest sources are sea food and dairy products.  The level of Iodine needed varies depending on age, gender and whether a woman is pregnant or lactating.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has published the results of a research (Report on Total Diet Study 2001-2005 published in September 2011).  It showed that average daily intake ranged from 170 - 260 micro grammes.  These intake ranges are in line with the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 130 micro grammes for the 18 - 64 age range. <\/p>  <p>  Currently UCD has been asked to do further analysis on the levels of iodine in the Irish diet and we are awaiting their results.  Early indications show that most Irish people are meeting the RDA but a certain proportion may have intakes below this during the summer; the reason for which may lie in the fact that milk and milk products contain less Iodine during the summer period.  Adding iodine to salt is permitted in Ireland and other European countries.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently revising the Healthy Eating Guidelines, which will be published later this year.  In addition, the Department intends to start work on a National Nutrition policy later in 2015, and iodine intake will form part of this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800074#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800074#WRS00700"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[7262\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800074#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Meath will receive an appointment at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin 11","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":444,"content":"<p>The scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.

While the Department aims to process all applications as quickly as possible, there is no uniform processing time for citizenship applications and some delays have been unavoidable where high volumes of applications are received.<br\/><br\/>All applications for Irish citizenship through Foreign Birth Registration must be accompanied by certain documentation depending on the type of application involved.

It was not possible to also secure the funding which would have been required to change the staffing schedule for schools.<br\/><br\/>  With regard to Resource Teachers for Travellers, the principle of inclusion is at the core of the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy published in 2006 and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment. In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.<br\/><br\/>  Following decisions of the last Government, as part of the December 2010 budgetary process, Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching now receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. This is in keeping with the policy of inclusion and the 2006 report. <br\/><br\/>  The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and English as an additional language allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012\/13 school year and now includes the Traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts under the General Allocation Model.<br\/><br\/>  Limited alleviation measures were also put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts\/hours, in the context of the limited resources available. <br\/><br\/>  Provision for English Language Support posts is now provided for under the General Allocation Model for schools, while further additional temporary language support posts are provided on the basis of appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards. The appeal criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.<br\/><br\/>  Since September 2012 guidance counsellor provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools). There is no scope to reverse this budget measure.<br\/><br\/>  Guidance and counselling are a whole-school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing their part within an overall team approach. The representative organisations for school principals and school management have developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. Wherever possible, group work and class-based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils who are most in need of one-to-one support. <br\/><br\/>  In February my Department published a guide to developing student support teams in post-primary schools. This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team.<br\/><br\/>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.<br\/><br\/>  It should be noted that there has been no overall reduction to the level of investment being provided to support children with special educational needs in our schools. On the contrary, the number of SNA and Resource Teaching posts being allocated to support children with special educational needs has increased in recent years to reflect demographic growth and increased demand in this area.<br\/><br\/>  This Government has been resolutely committed to protecting, and in some instances increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<br\/><br\/>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.<br\/><br\/>  365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705. Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available. This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<br\/><br\/>  With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.<br\/><br\/>  The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible. The report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.<br\/><br\/>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.<br\/><br\/>  With regard to the proposed new model of allocation, the Deputy will be aware that last week I announced that I am not proposing to change the way teachers are allocated to schools for children with Special Educational Needs for the coming school year.<br\/><br\/>  In making this decision to retain the current model for allocating resource and learning support teachers for the coming year, I have been guided by the advice of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Working Group report, which recommended that sufficient time should be allowed for further consultation totake place with the education stakeholders before the new model is implemented in schools. <br\/><br\/>  Through consultations which have already taken place, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders. However, while there has been significant consultation in relation to the proposed new model, there has not been sufficient time to address fully all of the concerns which have been raised, particularly those concerns relating to the profiling of schools, in advance the September 2015 school year. <br\/><br\/>  In particular, a robust mechanism for identifying children with complex special educational needs has yet to be finalised. Similarly it will be important to ensure that the concerns that successful schools continue to receive appropriate levels of support to ensure that their successes can be maintained are addressed.<br\/><br\/>  The proposed new allocation model was developed following advice received from the NCSE which indicated that the current model which requires that there is a formal assessment and diagnosis in place before an allocation is provided is unfair. The advice recommended removing diagnosis as a prerequisite for receiving support. The NCSE working group provided additional advice recommending that providing support to schools based on their educational profile was the best way currently available to ensure that schools would be able to support all children with special educational needs who needed such support. <br\/><br\/>  While the proposed new model is not proceeding for the coming year, work will continue in the coming months to develop the proposed new allocation model and to address the range of concerns which were identified through the consultations which have taken place so far, including the manner in which school profiles are developed. <br\/><br\/>  I have asked my Department to design a pilot of the new model which schools could opt into on a voluntary basis.<br\/><br\/>Continuing consultation with stakeholders will be a vital part of the ongoing work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800079#WRX00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800079#WRX00550"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[7253\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800079#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 433 of 27 January 2015, if she will report on any progress made with the Teachers Conciliation Council in order to address the anomaly of allowances granted to teachers who completed a further degree course during the school year 2011 to 2012.","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>The issue raised by the Deputy has been brought to the Teachers' Conciliation Council by representatives of the teachers concerned.

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital: research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.

This plan will be published in the coming weeks. A more detailed work plan outlining the consultation schedule will be published later this year. The CER has informed my Department that it will consult widely with stakeholders when considering any submission from Irish Water, and that there will be many opportunities for interested parties, including my Department, to participate in the consultations on the new connection charging policy.<\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of any letters received in my Department from local authority chief executives regarding the new connection fees for Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800081#WRZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800082#WRAA00300"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[7366\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800082#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the way he plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet current and future European Union standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has an\u00a0ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406\/2009\/EC).\u00a0 Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and specified that the target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the sectors of activity covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the non-ETS sector amounting to 43% and 30% by 2030 compared to 2005, respectively. While the specific details of the contribution towards the achievement of these targets to be made by each Member State remain to be defined, the Council agreed that all Member States will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity.<\/p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015, published last month.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406\/2009\/EC) in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period. However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020 and therefore the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address this particular challenge in the years 2017 to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. It is also important to note that the Bill published last month will provide for long-term successive planning in this respect. <\/p>  <p>  2015 will also be a pivotal year in terms of the international response to climate change, with all 196 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) working to conclude a new global agreement in Paris in December. The Paris outcome will build on existing agreements and chart a course for future global emissions reductions. Ireland, through the EU, will play its part in these negotiations and the globally agreed act ions arising. The October 2014 European Council commitment will be the basis of the EU's intended nationally-determined contribution to the new agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800082#WRAA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Licence Applications","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800082#WRAA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[7369\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800082#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 556 of 3 February 2015, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, despite the lack of a foreshore licence, sand is being removed from the Natura 2000 site (details supplied) at Akeragh, Banna and Barrow Harbour special protection area-special areas of conservation, to a private development, a golf course; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that no consultation took place between Kerry County Council and the local landowners or local community, in relation to the removal of sand from the site; no management plan for this Natura 2000 site has been presented by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to the local landowners for consultation; removal of sand from the beach is not permitted, as it was eroded from adjacent dunes, and so should be used to restore those dunes; no assessment was carried out to evaluate the environmental effects of removing sand from the beach, where there is visible and serious erosion; the removal of sand will have a negative effect on the surrounding habitats in the Natura 2000 site, which habitats are eroding up to 15 m in parts; the removal of sand will affect the overall integrity of this site, and damage the goodwill of the local landowners, who have been protecting it; the sand does not belong to Kerry County Council, but to the dunes owned by local landowners; removing sand is prohibited under the Foreshore Act, and all landowners must comply with this, even on their own land; local farmers are not entitled to take sand from the beach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br\/><br\/>A public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 which was launched last November, closed on the 12th February. 27 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks.

Kildare will be 100% covered by the State intervention.
