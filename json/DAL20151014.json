The Government is not possessed of any sense of urgency in relation to it, as eloquently articulated yesterday evening by Fr. Peter McVerry in his reaction to the lack of any action in the budget on this matter.  It is interesting to note that when Focus Ireland set up an action team in 2012, an average of eight new families were presenting as homeless in Dublin every month.  This figure rose to 40 families per month in 2014.  It has now risen to 65 to 70 families per month in the first half of 2015.  More than two new families are becoming homeless every single day, yet there is no action from the Government to arrest the situation.  The number of children sleeping in emergency homeless accommodation has almost doubled since October 2014.  Groups such as the Simon Community, Threshold and many other non-governmental agencies are extremely frustrated by the lack of action on this particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  In the immediate term, the Government could take preventative measures to prevent more families from becoming homeless by introducing rent certainty measures and increasing the rent supplement.  There seems to be some extraordinary reluctance, if not a stubbornness, to move on the rent certainty issue or to increase the rent supplement.  The Simon Community has stated that 92% of properties available to rent are priced beyond the reach of those in receipt of rent supplement.  Will the Taoiseach explain why there was no action in yesterday's budget on homelessness?  Why will the Government not make a decision on rent certainty and on increasing rent supplement for those who desperately need it to stay in a home or to get back into the housing market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400003#A00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444815000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is not acceptable that families and children, in particular, have to stay in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotel rooms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400003#A00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444815000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>For shame.

We will open 100 sites across the country in 2016 and will deliver at the mid-point of that up to 80 houses per week.  There is a requirement for 10,000 units, whether houses or apartments, in the Dublin area per annum.  Only 3,300 were delivered in the past year.  Having land, its own money and contractors who build for it, NAMA can provide these units and 90% of them will be provided in the Dublin area.  Some 75% of the units will be houses, mainly starter homes, which NAMA will deliver through its own developers.<\/p>  <p>  Last year the Government put &euro;2.2 billion on the table to deal with this legacy issue.  Yesterday, in the budget, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform added to that sum.  This year &euro;500 million is available to build or acquire new homes.  The Government also increased the current allocation for social housing by a further &euro;69 million to &euro;440 million.

A tremendous article by Kitty Holland was published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>which made devastating reading.  The Carrickmines site was overcrowded; 29 people were sleeping in cabins and caravans at the time of the fire.  D&uacute;n Laoighaire-Rathdown County Council is one of 15 local authorities in the State that have drawn down no funding this year for Traveller accommodation.  In the past seven years funding for accommodating members of the Traveller community has been cut by a shocking 93%, from &euro;70 million in 2008 to &euro;4.3 million this year.  Of the 10,226 Traveller families in the State, 445 are living on unauthorised sites by the side of the road without anything but the most basic facilities.  Some 104 families are living on basic serviced sites such as that on Glenamuck Road.  A further 223 families are sharing halting site bays with other families, while 37 are sharing basic halting site bays with other families.  In addition, 727 families are sharing houses with other families.  A total of 1,536 families are living in overcrowded or unsafe conditions.  This cannot continue.  Will the Government immediately work with the Traveller representative groups to ensure lessons are learned from this tragedy and that Traveller families across the State will be provided with the safe and adequate accommodation they need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400004#B03600","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1444815600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The answer is \"Yes\".  I visited the scene of the inferno at Carrickmines.  The site, although a temporary site established eight or ten years ago, was very neat and clean.  However, the units were located around the perimeter and made from the material that had caught fire, as a result of which ten people had lost their lives.  It is an extraordinary tragedy and so sad for everybody involved.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that an audit is being carried out of all Traveller accommodation units and halting sites throughout the country, many of them in locations with which I am familiar.  In Priory Hall, Longboat Quay and other locations around the country, places where all building regulations and planning conditions were supposed to be complied with, there have been fire traps.  In this case I assume the corrosive smoke was responsible for people being unable to move when the fire occurred and it resulted in that difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  Accommodation for Travellers is provided through a range of measures.  There are the standard local authority housing units financed by way of the Department for the Environment, Community and Local Government's capital allocation for social housing.  There is also Traveller-specific accommodation financed by the Department, while the purchase of private housing is assisted by the State and through Travellers' own resources.  An approved Traveller housing body, CENA, has recently been launched and is due to commence operations shortly.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation.  The 2014 annual count of Traveller families showed that of 10,226 families, the majority, 35%, were accommodated in standard social housing, 26% in private rented accommodation and 5% in assisted private housing, while 6% had been housed using their own resources.  A total of 13% were accommodated in group homes or permanent halting sites and bays, 9% were sharing accommodation, 1% were on transient sites and 4% on unauthorised sites.  That 4% represents a significant reduction from the first annual count which took place in 1999 and showed that 25% of Travellers were living on unauthorised sites.  The reduction is due to significant investment in Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing schemes and housing sites in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The level of investment was reduced in recent years, similar to many other forms of investment.  Notwithstanding this, &euro;400 million has been invested in the provision and support of this type of Traveller accommodation over the period.  Every local authority has a five year programme to accelerate the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation.  This requires particular expertise in the consultation process in the provision of the type of accommodation required for Traveller families.  The programmes started in 2000 and the current programmes run from 2014 to 2018.  During the period of the last programme 500 accommodation units were delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Every council has a local Traveller accommodation consultative committee comprising local authority officials, members of Traveller representative groups and other relevant bodies, including public representatives.  The committees assist in the preparation of the five-year rolling programmes and oversee implementation where possible.  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, is a national body appointed by the Minister.  It comprises representatives of the different State agencies and so forth.  It is the national platform for consultation.<\/p>  <p>  The site in Glenamuck was not an unauthorised site.  It was a temporary site, with services provided by the local authority, pending the putting in place of more permanent accommodation for the families.  I understand a site at Glen Druid in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown has been identified by the local authority in its Traveller accommodation programme for the period 2014 to 2018 for a group housing scheme of five units to meet the needs of the residents of Glenamuck.  Funding approval has been granted by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and work is expected to be completed in 2017-18.  In the interim, the necessity for a fully serviced, temporary site in the area for these families is being discussed and negotiated with a view to it being ready for occupation in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400004#B03700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444816200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I trust the Taoiseach will address the investment issues I have raised and also the lack of leadership that has been shown, not only at Government level but also at local level across the State.<\/p>  <p>  I have one more request to make of the Taoiseach today.  For too long there has been a wall of distrust between the settled and Traveller communities in this State.  Yesterday, some local residents in Glenamuck formed a blockade in protest at the plans to rehouse, on an emergency basis, those who have been left homeless by this inferno.  It is a depressing spectacle but it reflects the wall of distrust that has been in existence for many years.  We need citizens to show compassion and I hope the residents - who are meeting the council today - can facilitate this emergency arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for education and understanding between the two communities, and that is a two-way process.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended quite some time ago that this State recognise the ethnicity of our Traveller people, something that has been called for by international human rights bodies to which we subscribe.  It is time for the State to respect the unique contribution of Traveller communities in terms of their music, their language and their adherence to the ancient nomadic ways.  We need to teach their history in our schools and break down the barriers and the walls that exist.  It is time for this State to build the bridges of understanding.  It is time to build on the solidarity that is there after this horrific tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach stand up in this Chamber and recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller people?  Will he show the necessary leadership, although it will not just be required by him but by elected representatives across the State?  Can we finally address the injustice of the report on itinerancy from the 1960s that perceived this as a dirty problem that had to be swept under the carpet?  Can we once and for all be honest about the huge wall of distrust and take down the barriers?  Can we recognise their ethnicity and start from there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400005#C00100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1444816200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The first point the Deputy makes is important.  Clearly, the vast majority of communities in this country are prepared to work with the local authorities and different agencies in their own interests.  This is a very sensitive issue in that the funerals involved have not even taken place yet, although, to balance that, there has to be an explanation to any community of what a local authority intends to do as an emergency measure.  I think that is only the normal courtesy that should apply in any circumstance and I hope that matter can be dealt with today in order to provide temporary accommodation for those remaining families at the Glenamuck temporary site.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the deeper question the Deputy raises, this is an issue that is reacted to in different ways in different parts of the country and, in many cases, it is based on unfortunate experiences that have taken place.  The Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has done quite a deal of work on this and has brought a report to the Cabinet sub-committee in respect of the question of ethnicity and whether that be recognised or not.

This has come about because, in 1997, at a time when the Taoiseach was a member of Government, the current President signed off on legislation that has caused major problems throughout the country.  As I said, these people are accused of defending their own private property.  The Peatlands Council has been set up for turf cutters.  I spoke to the Taoiseach one night when he asked me to go to a forum.  We co-operated every step of the way but, sadly, the drive and initiative is not there from the State body, the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Instead of trying to solve a problem, it is trying to make criminals out of people who have never been in trouble in their lives.  This is not a solution to a problem and all it will do is create bigger difficulties.  It is now recognised, not by us but by the so-called experts, that up to 40% of the science used is completely wrong.  There are solutions, however.  One of them may be that, given the announcement that Bord na M&oacute;na has 80,000 ha which it is talking of shutting down, some of that ground could be used to ensure that the burden on people's private property is alleviated.  Taking legal action against people who never saw the inside of a court in their lives will not solve this problem.<\/p>  <p>  I meet representatives from the National Parks and Wildlife Service every six weeks.  I will put my shoulder to the wheel in resolving this matter, whatever way it needs to be resolved.  However, the one thing we keep hearing every day is Europe.  I ask the Taoiseach to use his influence with these technocrats in Europe - these faceless bureaucrats who are infringing on people's property rights.  People are willing to co-operate but there is a fear among our civil servants that when they go over, they will be told \"No\".  Does the Taoiseach want to see a resolution to this problem or does he want to see people in danger of ending up in jail, like this morning?  Whatever it takes, will he go to Europe and explain that this is a complex problem?  Farmers are being driven off their land and turf cutters are being driven off their bogs.  This is in the so-called interests of Europe but it is not a fair way.  There is a resolution.  Will the Taoiseach consider there may be an option in regard to the Bord na M&oacute;na land to help resolve the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400005#C00300","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1444816200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Yes, I spoke to Deputy Fitzmaurice about this previously and I spoke to his predecessor in the House, who had agreed a certain line of action and then decided to renege upon that.

In order to do this, the personal debt management agency would have quasi-judicial status.

In that way, it would be able to offer homeless people suitable long-term housing in the first instance and radically reduce the use of hostel accommodation and the associated costs for the Exchequer.  I respectfully suggest that the use of hostel accommodation has not reduced.  Rather, hotel and emergency accommodation for the homeless has doubled, treble or quadrupled.  The Government said that by having a dedicated body to formulate policy across Government, it would target initiatives in cross-cutting areas to prevent, as much as possible, problems like homelessness.

Specifically, the Government has committed to legislating for an historical investigations unit and the creation of an independent commission for information retrieval.  There has been consternation at the draft published by the British Government.  Using the pretext of national security, it would give the British Secretary of State the power to block full disclosure.  What are the Taoiseach's views on that issue and, more importantly, when will the Government publish a Stormont House Agreement implementation Bill?  Why is there no date for implementation of the international treaty to underpin the independent commission for information retrieval?<\/p>  <p>  The second issue concerns reformed and consolidated domestic violence legislation and the Istanbul Convention.  The tragic events of recent days have focused our minds on this issue.  Women's domestic violence groups have been raising the issue of the signing of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, known as the Istanbul Convention.

The Government set up the Convention on the Constitution and promised that it would complete its remit within 12 months.  I understand it did it in about 14 months.  The motion passed by the D&aacute;il setting it up said that the Government will provide in the Oireachtas a response to each recommendation by the convention within four months.  The last report from the convention was in March 2014, a year and a half ago.  It is not just the last report.  There are four outstanding reports so four debates have been promised.  It is an insult to those who took part.  I urge the Taoiseach to set aside Government time over at least the next four weeks to debate the last four remaining reports from the convention.<\/p>  <p>  There was talk here last week or possibly the week before about Longboat Quay and the need for an audit.  Some of the responses seemed to suggest that there is forthcoming legislation that will ensure that there will be new standards and responsibilities.  I have looked at the legislative programme and there does not seem to be any legislation that captures what is required.  The nearest I could find that is coming up in this session is the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill.  However, the problem there is that it says that it is to provide for the implementation of the planning recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  Does the Taoiseach now intend to change that legislation to take account of the needs of the planning inspectorate and planning enforcement around Longboat Quay and other buildings that were built in that era and the need for an audit, ongoing inspection regime and a standard for Traveller sites in light of the recent horrific tragedy?  Also, Taoiseach-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400008#F01100","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1444818000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>This is not the place for speeches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400008#F01200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444818000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>It is not a speech.

It is not just a budget for 2016 but also another step in our plan to sustain the recovery in the years ahead.  The past few years have been difficult for the people of Ireland, but their efforts have made it possible for the country to exit an international bailout, reduce our debts and safely progress into recovery.<\/p>  <p>  There is no denying that the country still faces many challenges arising from the economic crash brought about by the previous Administration.  In addressing these challenges the budget for 2016 mirrors the Government's goals for now and into the future: to make work pay and remove the barriers to work; to support more job creation and regional economic growth; and to rebuild a strong economy that can support better public services.  Budget 2016 represents another affordable and sensible step in addressing many of these challenges.  The Government I have the honour to lead will continue along the path laid out yesterday in order that we can keep the recovery going. <\/p>  <p>  Our first priority is to continue to make work pay.  While the Government has changed Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s bailout agreement to avoid future increases in income tax, it was clear that the existing level of tax on work and jobs was a drag on our recovery.  Since the introduction of the universal social charge - a brutal tax - by Fianna F&aacute;il, Ireland&rsquo;s taxation system has discouraged work and effort and is a barrier to economic recovery.  It was wrong that the Government took more than half of every extra euro being earned by hundreds of thousands of low and middle-income families.  Marginal tax rates on middle-income earners in Ireland are much higher than in the United Kingdom and other countries where many of our people have emigrated to and with which we are in competition for mobile talent and investment.<\/p>  <p>  Making work pay more than welfare will also be an essential part of our plan to get Ireland working again.  Today, there are too many families for wom work simply does not pay and it encourages an intergenerational cycle of joblessness and poverty.<\/p>  <p>  We started the process of reducing the tax burden on work and jobs for low and middle-income earners in the last budget and have continued with that strategy.  By reducing the universal social charge rates and bands we are reducing the marginal rate of tax to 49.5% for all earners earing under &euro;70,000.  This is a key milestone on the path to recovery.  As the Minister for Finance indicated yesterday, it is the first time since April 2009 that the marginal rate has dropped below 50% for middle-income workers.  While we continue to cap the benefit at &euro;70,000, those workers earning more will benefit on the portion of their income below this level. <\/p>  <p>  These tax changes are only a step in our plan to progressively abolish USC during the next term of office in order to secure full employment.  If returned, the Government will take another step each year towards the abolition of USC by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is also determined to make work pay more than welfare.  We established the Low Pay Commission this year to make annual recommendations on the level of the minimum wage.  It recommended to the Government that a 50 cent increase was justified and yesterday the Government approved the increase to the new level of &euro;9.15 an hour to support workers.  This will have a positive impact for the 75,000 workers earning the minimum wage.  The Government will continue to listen to the annual recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to ensure low-income workers will not be left behind as the economy recovers.  A single person on the minimum wage will benefit by more than &euro;700 arising from the budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also long signalled its desire to end the unfair tax treatment of self-employed workers.  The Government supports those who created their own jobs and have created jobs for others.  They are the shopkeepers, tradesmen and farmers who, in many cases, lead our recovery efforts in the domestic economy.  As a first step to end their unfair tax treatment, the Government is introducing an earned-income tax credit to the value of &euro;550.  To support and reward their work and effort, we will complete the tax equalisation for the self-employed in the coming years, with other measures to support our job creators.  This approach is in stark contrast to that of other parties in this House which want to tax job creators out the country. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will also prioritise more supports that will encourage and support working families.  Not having a job is the biggest source of inequality in our society.  Jobless households with children are at the greatest risk of experiencing child poverty and perpetuating a cycle of joblessness and welfare dependency, as often articulated by the T&aacute;naiste.  It is clear that excessive child care costs have become a barrier to work for many families.  For this reason, the Government is making another first step in the budget to overhaul child care supports.<\/p><p>We will now offer every child from the age of three a free preschool place until he or she begins primary school.  In addition, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, will extend the community child care subvention programme to help low income families remain in work and will also develop new after-school services.<\/p> <p> I am particularly pleased the Government is introducing a suite of supports which will ensure children with a disability can meaningfully participate in, and fully reap the benefits of, preschool education.  That is a most important step.<\/p> <p> We have listened carefully to the concerns of parents and in conjunction with these new services we will also introduce a range of quality assurance measures for early education.  Those will include audits, inspections and training.  We will also extend free GP care to all primary school children of working families, subject to negotiations with the relevant organisations.  Those are steps in the right direction, and in the years ahead, we will do more to support working families and their child care needs.<\/p> <p> All the measures to make work pay are designed to help create more jobs and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to fill those jobs.  Since entering office we have prioritised measures to create new jobs so that people can get their lives back on track.  Since we launched the Action Plan for Jobs in 2012 we have seen the private sector add 125,000 new jobs in the economy.  The recovery in jobs has accelerated in 2015 with more than 1,300 new jobs created each week.  This budget will keep the jobs recovery moving in the right direction.<\/p> <p> As part of the budget, we have published a capital plan to ensure all regions share in its benefits.  This &euro;27 billion investment plan for Ireland is essential to restore all the jobs lost in the recession by 2018 and to get unemployment rates down to 6% by 2020.  It has been welcomed as an affordable and realistic plan that is also consistent with the Government plan to eliminate Government borrowing by 2018.  The new investment planned in roads, public transport, education, health care, flood risk, enterprise and policing are all designed to alleviate growing pressures in the economy which could hold back recovery.  However, the recovery is not complete and we must continue to manage the national finances carefully or risk falling back.  We cannot afford everything we want but this plan represents the best of what can be delivered with the available resources.<\/p> <p> New jobs will also be created from new business ventures.  As a Government, we need to support those who take the risk to start new business, create more jobs and export to more countries around the world.  We are extending the three-year corporation tax relief for new startup companies.  That is to be welcomed.  For those who are successful in creating a new company and who wish to use their success to start another business we are reducing capital gains tax on a limited basis for those disposing of their interest in a business.  The very successful home renovation scheme, which has supported thousands of construction-related jobs during very tough times, is being extended until the end of 2016.  Our farming and food sector has been one of the main success stories of the recovery to date, but there are still many structural challenging facing the sector.  To reflect that, we are extending the range of agri-tax reliefs until the end of 2018 and introducing a new succession partnership model to help pass knowledge and capital from one generation to another in an orderly fashion.<\/p> <p> The tourism sector was in crisis when we entered Government in 2011.  With the introduction of a number of measures to support its recovery, it has now reached new records levels.  To keep the recovery going in the regions around the country, we will continue to maintain the 9% rate of VAT on tourism-related services.<\/p> <p> In addition to supporting Irish business, we have also continued the strategy of attracting more foreign investment and jobs.  In the first half of this year, IDA Ireland won 110 new investments and it expects to create 9,000 new jobs around the country by the end of this year.  The continuation of our transparent and statute-based corporation tax regime remains an essential pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy.  We now compete with a low tax rate of 12.5% applied to a wide base.  Our success to date has been due to offering a best-in-class corporation tax regime on which enterprise can rely.  In continuing this strategy, we are halving the rate of corporation tax on qualifying innovative products and services developed in Ireland.  To reflect Ireland&rsquo;s positive international engagement with tax reform through the OECD, the knowledge development box will be the first OECD compliant offering in the world.  It is set at 6.25%.  That will offer more certainty and stability to business in the long term and make this country an even more attractive location for foreign direct investment.<\/p> <p> The Government still needs to do far more to rebuild a sustainable economy with strong sectors that can support full employment.  Our flagship in this regard has been the Action Plan for Jobs, designed to support enterprise achieve its goals in terms of jobs, exports and startups, access to finance, market penetration, innovation, access to talent and efficient public sector interaction.  Its success can be seen in the jobs recovery to date which has been driven almost exclusively by increases in full-time positions.  The jobs recovery is also broad based - with increases in 11 of the 14 sectors of the economy.  To keep the recovery going, the Government is already drafting a new Action Plan for Jobs for 2016.  We also need to take a longer term perspective to achieve our goals of replacing all the jobs lost by 2018 and to reduce unemployment to 6%.  The Government has mandated the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to bring forward a longer term enterprise strategy to Cabinet shortly.  This new enterprise policy 2025 will set the strategic framework for a competitive, export-orientated economy that can support full employment.<\/p> <p> The Government&rsquo;s plan of tax cuts and enterprise supports will help to rebuild a strong and sustainable economy.  Reducing the high tax burden on low and middle income families helps to create jobs, put Ireland back to work and generates the revenue needed to support vital public services.  It is not a case of one or the other; one supports the other.  In last year's budget we cut the universal social charge, USC, and income tax rates, but the yield from those taxes was still up 6% in the first eight months because those measures have helped support the recovery.  As a result, we have been able to fund additional spending in health, transport and education.  In that sense, our plan is to deliver a virtuous circle of tax cuts on work, more jobs, and to improve public finances and services.<\/p> <p> As the economy recovers we are now investing more in vital public services.  In our hospitals, 880,000 day cases will be carried out by the end of the year - an increase of nearly 20% in the past five years.  The Government has also protected front-line staff numbers.  Since the beginning of last year we have hired approximately 1,000 extra nurses and as the recovery continues, we will continue to support and expand our heath service where appropriate.<\/p> <p> Next year we will recruit 2,260 additional teaching posts, including 600 new resource teachers.  That will result in a reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level from 28:1 to 27:1, and at second level from 19:1 to 18.7:1.  Next year we also plan to extend GP care without fees to all children under the age of 12, subject to negotiations.<\/p> <p> In order to tackle crime we are continuing our recruitment strategy with 600 new garda&iacute; next year in addition to the roll-out of vital crime fighting ICT equipment.  We will continue to keep the Garda training college in Templemore open for the training of recruits.<\/p> <p> All of those new investments are essential to keep the recovery going and to support economic growth and job creation.  The budget is an affordable and sensible way to secure recovery.  It signals an end to the boom and bust approach of previous Governments that put the economy at risk for electoral advantage.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Government increased gross spending by 139% between 2000 and 2008.  In the run-up to the 2007 election, between 2005 and 2007, public spending was ramped up by more than 25%.  By comparison, in 2016, public expenditure will be just 4% higher than in 2014.  Over that time, tax revenues are forecast to increase by more than 14%, while the economy is set to grow by 18%.  We are set to reduce the deficit to 2.1% in 2015, falling to 1.2% next year and to eliminate it entirely by 2018.  In comparison, Opposition parties continue to make unfunded and reckless demands that would put the recovery at risk.<\/p> <p> As we look forward and plan for 2016 and the years ahead, the opportunity now exists to secure the economic recovery and to build an enterprise economy and society that delivers secure and well-paid jobs, incomes and pensions, world class infrastructure, high quality public services and certainty and the opportunity for so many more people to move from the unemployment register into the world of work where work can be seen to pay.<\/p><p>As the end of this D&aacute;il approaches, we are facing a fork in the road.  One track points to continued stability and certainty about the future.  The signposts along that way are now clear, namely, no booms, no busts but responsible increases in public spending within a reformed public service built on a solid platform of steady economic growth; the completion of tax equalisation for the self-employed and other measures to support job creators; more realistic and affordable increases in the minimum wage to make work pay; the progressive abolition of the universal social charge, USC, to reward work and effort and to make Ireland more attractive for mobile foreign investment and skills, including for returning emigrants; low interest rates for business and home owners, underpinned by further deficit and debt reduction and rising domestic and international confidence; and a robust defence of the 12.5% corporation tax as the linchpin of the Government's jobs policy.<\/p> <p> As we face this division in the road, one surely can see that along the other track lies instability and chaos.  The siren songs of ending austerity and fairer recovery will, in fact, mean the exact opposite.  The stepping stones back towards the economic abyss are well laid out in alternative budgets published by the Opposition, namely, an Oireachtas unable to pass coherent budgets, sapping confidence and undermining economic discipline and job-killing tax increases on work and business to pay for reckless promises.  In that context, I am surprised the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has moved so far from where the late Se&aacute;n Lemass had placed it as a low-tax party that was confident and competent based on competitiveness and exports.  Instead, one is faced with job-killing tax increases on work and business to pay for reckless promises coming from Opposition parties, as well as the prospect of confidence-destroying confrontation with our international partners and higher interest rates.  In recent months, all Members have seen how quickly fragile economic recoveries unravel in the face of political instability and reckless economic management.  The Opposition wants the country to go backwards but the Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party guarantees that stability and further progress in the interests of all the people.  This budget brings the country forward and secures the economic recovery and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400011#J05300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444821000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400013#L00200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1444821000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>This is a carefully designed, responsible, interlocking budget in which different pieces come together to form the overall picture, that is, a picture of a country moving firmly in the right direction and of a society becoming more confident that both society and the economy can be restored.  The budget is designed to help people back to work, to raise living standards in all homes, to help vulnerable people in society, to provide better services, to maintain the great progress the Government has made in restoring the public finances to health and to reducing the debt to sustainable levels and to capitalise on the opportunity we now have to deliver an Ireland that is better for all.<\/p>  <p>  The budget is designed to improve the lives and living standards of every person and every family in the country, including the person on the minimum wage who, as a result of these changes, will be more than &euro;700 better off next year and the middle-income family with two children who will be almost &euro;1,000 better off because they will pay less USC and receive more child benefit.  Moreover, if they have younger children, they also will benefit from additional early childhood care.  It also includes the 66 year old carer who will receive an increase to his or her weekly payment and a 75% Christmas bonus and who will see the respite care grant restored in full to &euro;1,700; the retired couple who will see their pensions increase and receive the 75% Christmas bonus; the jobseeker who desperately wants to get back to work but needs some help to get there; and the nurse, garda or teacher whose take-home pay will increase as the Government unwinds the financial emergency legislation and gradually restores public sector pay.<\/p>  <p>  This budget is about progress and opportunity.  It is about the progress that we, as a people together, have achieved in putting this country back on its feet.  It is about the opportunity we now have to secure the recovery and raise living standards in a sustained way by continuing to follow the right path, that is, the path set out by the Labour Party and Fine Gael in government.  Let me be clear: we are moving steadily in the right direction.  The economy is growing at speed.  As T&aacute;naiste, Labour Party leader and Minister for Social Protection, my absolute priority is helping people back into work.  In this context, 130,000 jobs have been added since the peak of the crisis and unemployment has fallen by more than one third from a rate of more than 15% to one of 9.4% at present.  For the second budget in a row, the Government is raising living standards in a responsible and sustainable way that safeguards the public finances.  It is investing in essential public services such as the expansion of the early childhood care and education scheme to give children the best possible start in life.  In addition, the Government is reducing pupil-teacher ratios in schools to give children the best possible education and is funding the next phase of free general practitioner, GP, care for six to 11 year old children to ensure their parents need not worry about the cost of visiting the doctor.<\/p>  <p>  However, while we are on the right path, we have not reached our destination yet, that is, an Ireland which is visibly better for all.  Many people have not yet felt the recovery.  They have family members and friends who still struggle with the after-effects of recession.  Renewed prosperity has not yet reached all communities and any suggestion here today that the Government has dealt with all problems would be glib in the extreme.  The depth and scale of the crisis was far too savage for that.   The Government has a way to go, more work to do and significant problems yet to solve.   However, it can be more than hopeful of doing so; it can be confident of so doing because the country now has the opportunity to do this and it must be grabbed with both hands.  The Government has the opportunity to make this a better country for all, to invest in the services that will make this a reality and to create a strong economy, a decent society and thriving communities.  This opportunity has been built on the work undertaken since 2011.  Back then, Fianna F&aacute;il had strung a wrecking ball through the economy and society.  People&rsquo;s lives and hopes for their futures and those of their children had been flattened.  When the Labour Party and Fine Gael came into government, they had a simple task, namely, to rescue the country from that ruin, to rebuild the economy and to repair society.<\/p>  <p>  This is the Government's fifth budget.  The first three, in particular the first two, were immensely difficult for people.  However, they were necessary to restore the public finances to health, to help sustain, create and regrow employment and to chart a course towards strong economic growth; not the jobless growth of old recoveries but a job-rich growth which I am pleased to state is what has been achieved.  At all times, the Government has sought to protect the most vulnerable in society to the greatest extent possible.  Last year, much quicker than most economists had expected in 2011, the Government was able to introduce a budget that began the process of raising living standards and re-investing in communities.  The Government kick-started the social recovery and is continuing that process this year.  This is a budget for the people made possible by the people.  This is a budget designed to help low and middle-income workers, families, retired people and vulnerable groups in particular.<\/p>  <p>  The USC was a dreadful and difficult legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s wretched approach to the economy.  In this budget, the Government is reducing USC for the second year running; it is reducing all three rates in order that low and middle-income workers benefit and it is capping the gains for the highest paid.<\/p><p>We are also increasing the entry point for USC.  This means that anybody earning less than &euro;13,000 per annum will pay no USC from 2016 onwards.  As a result of these changes from January next 700,000 low-income earners will be exempt from the USC and for middle income PAYE earners, the marginal tax rate will fall below 50%.  This is an important milestone on the road to our recovery, both in terms of the message it sends out to people in Ireland and the message it sends out abroad.  This is a highly progressive approach, one that, as T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party, I am proud to have delivered together with the Taoiseach and Fine Gael.<\/p> <p> If re-elected to government, the Labour Party will work to phase out USC for all low and middle income earners.  By stark contrast, I note that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to retain the USC.  It wants to retain this emergency tax in place despite the fact the emergency is over.  The reason it wants to retain the USC is because it has realised none of its previous tax plans added up.  While the totals in this regard have been checked off by the Department of Finance, frankly, I, and most other people who have reviewed them, find them difficult to make sense of.  Meet Fianna F&aacute;il Nua, formerly Sinn F&eacute;in.  Fianna F&aacute;il ran the country into the ground and Sinn F&eacute;in would return it there in no time at all.<\/p> <p> By contrast, this Government is delivering a budget that raises living standards in a fair and sustainable way.  The overall affect of the changes is that the biggest gains are made by the bottom 30% of earners and the smallest gains are made by the top 10%.  Families will particularly benefit.  The child benefit increase of &euro;5 will benefit more than 623,000 families and almost 1.2 million children.  I make no apologies for retaining child benefit as a universal payment because, overwhelmingly, it is paid to mothers whether working in or outside the home.  It is a crucial support.  As a result of the USC and child benefit changes, a family with one parent working and earning a salary of &euro;45,000 per annum will be more than &euro;830 better off next year.  As a female leader, I am particularly pleased that this Government has been able to announce progressive change for mothers working in the home or in the workplace.  I am tired of approaches that seek to pit one woman against the other, as if there is a perfect model that every mother, every family, should adopt, as though there were not times when people want to care at home and other times when people want to be fully involved in a vibrant way in the workforce and labour force.  There are different stages in people's lives within a family situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400013#L00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444821600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400014#M00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1444821600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>It is important to remember that fathers who work in the home, of which there are a growing number, will benefit from the changes in the same way.  I am pleased that we are announcing an increase in the home carer&rsquo;s credit from &euro;810 to &euro;1,000, which will offer better options to families at different stages in their lives.  The days are rightly gone when child-rearing or caring for a relative was considered solely the woman&rsquo;s prerogative.  Many men now take some time off work to help with child-rearing at home.  The time has long since past since this was considered solely a woman's prerogative.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, we are investing heavily in child care to increase options for families where both parents are in the workplace.  This includes the extension of the early childhood care and education scheme, which has been a long-standing priority for me.  In addition, I am allocating &euro;5 million in 2016 for a new paternity benefit scheme.  This will allow fathers in employment, from next September, to take two weeks paternity leave.  This will be paid at the rate of &euro;230 per week, based on the same PRSI contributions as required for maternity benefit.<\/p>  <p>  This budget will raise living standards and improve services for workers, families and children.  It will also increase incomes and provide greater security for retired people.  Throughout the worst of the crisis, we protected the State pension.  I am pleased that in this budget, we are announcing an above-inflation increase of &euro;3 per week for pensioners aged 66 and over.  This was a priority of mine and of the Taoiseach.  This is the first weekly rate increase for pensioners since 2009 and is long overdue.  In the years since, many pensioners have supported their adult children and their families throughout very difficult times.  They deserve to see their income in retirement increase now that we have some room to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  I am glad that pensioners will not only receive a rate increase but will also benefit from the 75% Christmas bonus.  The least well-off pensioners will also benefit from the increase in the fuel allowance.  I am glad to say that this amounts to a solid three-part package for many of our retired citizens.  I make no apologies to those who question the logic of the spend on the Christmas bonus.  As T&aacute;naiste and Labour Party leader, my focus is on ensuring we improve things for every person, not just a few.  Fair dues to Fianna F&aacute;il of former days and the late Mr. Haughey who introduced the Christmas bonus, which as a child I recall was of great importance to my great aunts and uncles and of great significance to people who find Christmas spending a particular challenge.  The people of this country deserve immense credit for ensuring that social solidarity remained intact throughout the crisis, when it fractured in other countries.  This solidarity is based on the simple concept, that age-old Irish tradition of looking out for someone less fortunate than oneself.  The bonus is not just a welcome assistance to retired people at a financially stressful time of year, it also helps a range of other vulnerable people, including lone parents, long-term jobseekers, carers and people with disabilities.  For a single person on disability allowance, this will mean a bonus payment of &euro;141 at Christmas.  For a pensioner couple, both in receipt of the non-contributory State pension, it will mean a bonus payment of &euro;327.50.  As we all know, the bonus is largely spent in local economies countrywide.  It provides a boost not only for the individuals and families who receive it, but also for local businesses and the community.  In other words, it is money well spent in every conceivable way.<\/p>  <p>  While the bonus is an important measure for vulnerable groups it is not the only important measure.  Carers play an incredibly important role in our society.  I am, therefore, pleased to be increasing the respite care grant by &euro;325 to &euro;1,700 per annum.  In addition, people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance will continue to receive their payment for an additional six weeks subsequent to the death of the loved one for whom they were caring.  I am conscious that when the person for whom a carer has been caring dies this can be an enormously traumatic time.  We have been in discussion with the Carer's Association in relation to the provision of options for people following that period.  This will bring the total grace period from six weeks to 12 weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s allowance recipients aged 66 and over will benefit from the &euro;3 per week increase announced for pensioners.<\/p><p>We are also in a position to increase another very important support for vulnerable households, the fuel allowance.  It will be increased by &euro;2.50 a week to &euro;22.50 for the duration of the fuel season.  This means tested payment targets households with the most need for income support.  This increase will benefit almost 381,000 low income households.  There is not a Deputy in the House who does not know some elderly person or some other person living on their own perhaps in rural Ireland.  The fuel allowance is incredibly important for them.  As things improve for us, it is appropriate that the Government has agreed to resource that in a better way.  <br\/><br\/>The social protection system has long ceased to be solely about income supports.  Since 2011, the Department has also become a public employment service offering services to employers to identify and hire the right people.  We have some of the best people who unfortunately are still without employment.  In some cases they have engaged with the networks to find employment having lost their job and not being able to find another..  That is critical because secure and fairly paid work is the single best protection against poverty in the long term.  It is the single best path to financial independence for a person or a family.  The Labour Party has always been the party of work, and the party of workers&rsquo; rights.  This is another pro-work budget, another budget designed to ensure that work pays.  The increase in the minimum wage to &euro;9.15 an hour from January is a hugely important measure for low-paid workers. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I pledged earlier this year that if we increased the minimum wage, we would address any PRSI effect that would arise from such an increase.  We are doing precisely that in this budget.  I am introducing a new tapered PRSI credit for class A PRSI employees earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 in a week.  This will reduce the weekly PRSI bill for over 88,000 employees and will be on top of the gains from the USC changes announced in the budget.  In addition, the lower 8.5% class A rate of employer PRSI will be extended to over 26,000 employers as we increase the employer threshold from &euro;356 to &euro;376.  To further support families in work, the income thresholds for family income supplement will be increased by &euro;5 a week for families with one child and &euro;10 a week for families with two or more children.  This will result in an additional &euro;3 or &euro;6 per  week for low-income working families in receipt of the family income supplement.  This measure will benefit some 60,000 families who, among them, have more than 131,000 children.  In addition, lone parent families who transitioned from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance transitional arrangements will benefit from changes to the latter, increasing the disregards and lowering the calculation of the means.  Put simply, these measures will ensure additional income for lone parents in the workforce and help them build towards financial independence over time.  Both the family income supplement and the changes in regard to the lone parent transitional payment are particularly designed to improve the situation for low income households and to encourage them in a situation where no one in the household is working to get at least one of the people in the household out working for a significant amount of time.<br\/><br\/>Coupled with all these measures are very significant investments in our schools, in health care, in housing and in other essential public services.  For example, since the beginning of 2012, we have invested more than &euro;1.25 billion in school buildings.  We have built 102 new schools and completed 71 large-scale school extensions.  Our primary schools have achieved the best reading and mathematics results in 30 years, thanks to the great work done by the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400014#M00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444822200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400015#N00200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1444822200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>-----and now his successor the Minister, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, is equipping primary and post-primary schools for the next wave of improvement.<\/p>  <p>  This budget will deliver more than 2,200 new teachers and reduce the pupil-teacher ratio by one point at both levels.  This is something that people involved in teaching have strongly recommended.  We agreed with the recommendation but we did not have the resources to implement it.  I am delighted to say that we do have them now.  Again, this is about both progress and opportunity, the progress in making our schools better, and the enhanced opportunity that this provides in turn for our children.  In all of this, we are investing in our future, investing in Ireland's potential, and we are doing it in a responsible and sustainable way.  Our deficit will fall to just 1.2% of GDP and our debt-to-GDP ratio will fall to 93% next year.  I know those figures do not seem incredibly important but they are.  It means that next year our debt level will have fallen to just slightly below the eurozone average.  People have seen that in recent days we borrowed &euro;1 billion on the debt markets for 15 years, which is very long-term money, at an interest rate of 1.65%.  This budget is firmly based in having the structure that meets the requirements of the EU treaties.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio for 2015 will have fallen to 97% from the high that we inherited of over 120%.  That means that we are bringing down the debt as we grow the economy.  That is precisely the way the Keynesian and social democratic economists approach the business of putting an economy and a society back on its feet.  We are doing this.<\/p>  <p>  The difference could not be clearer.  The single most striking thing about the Opposition's response to this budget has been the sense of absence and the sense of confusion.  By \"absence\" I mean the absence of any serious idea to address the hard issues of the debt and deficit, which we have to do, in order to be able to borrow money at cheap rates.  At the same time we have to be ambitious, to improve both the tax situation in terms of people at work and the provision of vital services for everybody in our country as well as providing solid income supports for people like pensioners who rely on social welfare in retirement.  When I took over from the previous Minister for Social Protection, I faced a deficit, or a hole, in the Social Insurance Fund that was rapidly approaching &euro;2 billion.

It is not a budget to shape Ireland&rsquo;s future but one to help two parties get through an election campaign.  Instead of a plan to address deep problems which have developed in recent years, what we have is a series of policy soundbites.  This, fundamentally, is why Fine Gael's and the Labour Party&rsquo;s last throw of the dice will fail.  This Government has debased the budget process through its extreme manipulation of figures and its policy of always hiding the negatives.<\/p>  <p>  This year the Government has set a new standard of cynicism in seeking credit for partly restoring cuts which it promised the people it would never make in the first place.  Every little did hurt.  No matter how successful the Government is at getting its lines covered, the legacy of broken promises and unfair decisions remains.  People have had enough of the constant overspinning by the Government.  They are sick of the never-ending abuse of language where there is no relationship between what is announced and what is actually provided for on the ground.  They have had enough of a Government which has failed to anticipate or address any of the major crises which have arisen in recent years.  Most of all, they have come to understand that one can trust almost nothing this Government says.<\/p>  <p>  After six months of hype and stories planted daily in our newspapers, the sum of what was announced yesterday is a cynical budget, full of inflated claims which are already unravelling.  It is clear now why Fine Gael was so eager to run to the country in four weeks' time.  Its Ministers know the impact of this budget will disappear as soon as people see how many problems are not being addressed, how they have no plans to tackle them and how many of their regressive policies will remain in place.<\/p>  <p>  The budget fails to provide a credible long-term approach to any major problem.  For child care, support for the elderly, health, homelessness, education, employment conditions, community development, drugs, rural crime, disability supports or any other important societal issue, the very most that has been announced is a token provision.  The shambles and waste of Irish Water did not even merit a passing reference.  The horizon is purely to get through election day while all other considerations have been pushed aside.<\/p>  <p>  To listen to the Ministers' speeches yesterday, one would have imagined that everything is fine.  The scale and impact of crises which are hurting hundreds of thousands was completely ignored.  There was not even a token acknowledgement of the health service shambles, the acute pressures felt by the elderly or the mounting evidence of a two-tiered recovery where some get ahead but too many are being left behind.<\/p>  <p>  The growing cynicism of Fine Gael's and the Labour Party&rsquo;s budgets is well beyond a joke.  They have radically reduced the amount of information available to assess the impact of the announcements.  In presenting figures, even the reduction or maintenance of current funding is claimed as an increase.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, went as far as to refuse to produce core data on the income distribution effects of budget measures.  This information was a basic part of budget documentation for 20 years until they decided it might get in the way of their political claims.  All that we get now is their info-graphics showing a part-picture of what happens for a small selection of households.  Even including the increase in the minimum wage as a budget measure when employers will pay it, was a claim too far.<\/p>  <p>  The Ministers have done everything possible to hide the true impact of their budgets because their record is one of actively increasing inequality.  In every single one of their budgets, the highest benefit has gone to the highest earners.  This is particularly true when one factors in the significant impact cuts targeted against the weaker sections of society have.  Up to 60% of income earners get below &euro;30,000.  That is why this budget is fundamentally lacking in equality.<\/p>  <p>  The speeches of the Minister for Public Expenditure, Deputy Brendan Howlin, are always masterclasses in how to hide reality in a cloud of smoke.  Yesterday&rsquo;s performance was among his most brazen.  Clearly, the Labour Party has been hurting from the claim it has supported deeply regressive policies in government.  The Minister decided to claim that the Labour Party had, in fact, been incredibly fair.  The proof of this is, he claimed, the fact that Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax regimes in Europe.  What he did not say is that 100% of this is accountable to budgets introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il but voted against by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.<\/p>  <p>  Every single independent study of budget policy from 2007 onwards has stated Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s budgets made the wealthiest pay the most, while Fine Gael's and the Labour Party&rsquo;s have given them the most.  The studies also stated the clear majority of budget corrections were implemented before Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office.  It takes a peculiar brand of political cynicism to attack people at the same time as trying to claim credit for their policies.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party will never get out of the hole it has dug for itself until it is willing to accept the evidence, understood by everyone in this country, that this has been an unfair and divisive Government, obsessed with politics and oblivious to the damage caused by it policies.  Every one of the past four budgets was announced with a claim that it was fair.  Looking back at some of the claims made, however, one will see Ministers living in a parallel universe where they imagined that nobody would notice the reality of tax after tax levied with no concern for ability to pay.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s obsession with pretending not to have increased tax has been central to this crude, right-wing approach to tax.<\/p>  <p>  This year yet again, the highest benefit has been felt by the highest earners.  The tax changes result in a gain of 1.9% for an earner on &euro;75,000 but only 0.8% for someone on &euro;20,000.  The Minister did not even try to defend that yesterday.  Dress it up any way one wants, but this is not a progressive tax policy.  There is still no direct tax relief for parents to help with the huge cost of child care.<\/p>  <p>  One of the innovations this year is for Ministers to claim the minimum wage increase in its budget giveaway figures for households.  It is now the official policy of the Labour Party and Fine Gael to balance wage increases paid by employers to the low paid with tax reductions for the highest paid.  It was an extraordinarily cynical act.  The Government does not pay the minimum wage; the private sector does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400016#O00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444822800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il cut the minimum wage by &euro;1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400016#O00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1444822800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Yes, that was Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s bright idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400016#O00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1444822800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>With the greatest respect, we increased it to the highest level in Europe prior to the crash.<\/p><p>The clawing back of &euro;300 million through the failure to index tax bands is a significant policy decision.  This was not announced yesterday; it is buried in the documentation.  The obvious purpose of this was to give space for changes which might win a few more headlines.<\/p><p>At the conclusion of five budgets, the net impact of the income policies of this Government is entirely clear.  It has significantly increased inequality.  It squeezed the middle further and then failed to relieve it in spite of endless stories promising action.<\/p><p>The Government has put political positioning ahead of everything else during its term.  It entered office with the objective of claiming credit for the recovery which it knew would come.  Selling the fairy tale of a decisive Government coming into office and turning things around quickly, no matter what the impact, was its single guiding obsession.  It did not seek to shape a recovery which would benefit all parts of our society.  It merely wanted to play politics with recovery.  <\/p> <p> To the mounting fury of many Government members and backbenchers, the public have been reluctant to shower them with laurels and re-elect them by acclamation.  The problem is that everyone knows that the Government did not deliver this recovery.  The economy is growing today at roughly the long-term trend rate predicted by all major research bodies.  This is growth built on the foundation of skills and enterprise developed by the people over decades.  Ireland is recovering because of its core strengths, not because of a politically obsessed Government which has no interest in long-term issues.  The Government did not deliver recovery, but it did make it unfair and divisive.  It also allowed crisis after crisis to develop because of a refusal to engage in even basic planning on fundamental issues and its addiction to short-term action.<\/p> <p> One of the major problems for the Government is that it is trying to claim credit for growth it does not understand and did not predict.  For the first half of its term, growth was lower than it had predicted and now it is higher.  The majority of measures to fix the structural deficit were in place before the Government took office.  That is a fact which cannot be disputed.  If it wants to claim that fiscal retrenchment delivered recovery, the Government has an enormous problem of having campaigned and voted against it budget after budget.  <\/p> <p> Ireland has a great economic story to tell the world of a dedicated and skilled people and solid foundations, but the Government is refusing to tell it because it gets in the way of its political strategy.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, was absolutely right when he said those who promised to simply throw out tough policies were making promises which were both unrealistic and foolish.  It does, however, take some neck for the Government to attack the policies of the far left here and say, \"Who speaks of Syriza now?&rdquo;  It was the Labour Party and Fine Gael who were promising the radical alternative in 2011.\u00a0 It was they who promised &ldquo;not a red cent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Labour&rsquo;s way or Frankfurt&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;\u00a0 They were the Syriza of 2011-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400016#O00600","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444823400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>They were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400017#P00400","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1444823400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>-----but with one major difference - the Labour Party and Fine Gael did not even try to implement their promises.

All that the parties on the left are doing today is copying the Kenny-Gilmore model; therefore, a little less of the smug sanctimony would be in order.<\/p>  <p>  As it comes to the end of a five-year term, the Government is distinguished by the fact that it has never produced a long-term statement of economic policy.\u00a0 It has maintained a fiscal plan it once attacked as unacceptable and has produced a mountain of self-serving economic commentary, but it has never set out a vision for the future of the economy and the society we want it to support.

Fine Gael&rsquo;s decade old commitment to compulsory health insurance is a shambles which the party&rsquo;s Ministers and backbenchers are now too embarrassed to talk about.  The Government is even trying to change the language around it.  Other than that, all we have seen is public relations initiatives.\u00a0 Many publicly funded bodies have been closed down in order to be reopened and renamed by Ministers.  Basic everyday activities have been rebranded and public servants put under orders not to allow anything to happen without a Minister present to announce it.\u00a0 In fact, the entire machinery of government which should be focused on anticipating and addressing real problems has become dominated by ministerial obsessions with public relations.  This has shown itself particularly strongly in the enterprise sector, where announcements which used to be seen as run-of-the-mill are now held up until the right branding is produced and half the Cabinet can attend.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest components of the Government&rsquo;s economic fairy tale is that it claims to have \"delivered\" or \"created\" tens of thousands of jobs.\u00a0 In the first weeks of his Administration, the Taoiseach signalled his intention in this regard by demanding that salary caps be lifted in order that Fine Gael&rsquo;s most senior press officer could be placed in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a special brief to relentlessly sell the Action Plan for Jobs as the source of all new jobs.  The fact is that the OECD reviewed the Action Plan for Jobs and stated it was impossible to show that it had created extra employment and that the bulk of employment growth was, undoubtedly, down to other economic fundamentals.\u00a0 In fact, there are elements of the action plan which actually represent reduced activity and, therefore, lost jobs.\u00a0 This is, for example, the position in the case of research, where a major exodus of scientists has been under way, although it has not stopped the Action Plan for Jobs road show.<\/p>  <p>  In IDA Ireland&rsquo;s 66 years, it has never had such a clamour from the Government to make a media event out of every announcement.\u00a0 Once again, the core long-term strength of a State agency and policy is undermined by the focus of political spin.\u00a0 Even during the worst years of the crisis, inward investment continued and was resilient.\u00a0 The export sector performed strongly and led the return to growth to the point where Government policies were suppressing domestic demand.<\/p>  <p>  The action plan also introduced a policy now common in all Government actions of renaming existing activity in order to claim something new.\u00a0 The most cynical example of this was the closing of the county enterprise boards and their rapid reopening with a new name.  Job growth has been and will remain strong in the medium term.  However, this is where the real force of the two-tiered recovery is being felt.\u00a0 A drift towards almost separate labour forces is under way, where one has access to highly paid, secure jobs, while the other is caught in low-paid and insecure jobs.  It took three years before the Government even admitted this was happening.\u00a0 In spite of lots of inflated claims, yesterday there was no indication of a genuine commitment to address it.  In addition to the banning of exploitative contracts, we need an all-out effort to stop people from getting caught in low-paid, low-security jobs.<\/p>  <p>  We can talk about talent and having to reduce the marginal tax rate.

Every single target to make credit available to SMEs has been missed.  They continue to be squeezed by State-owned banks which are being fattened for a rapid sale.  If Ireland is to have a long-term balance and sustainability in its economy, it needs to have a vibrant and innovative SME sector.\u00a0 This work has barely started.  In addition, the Government's capital gains tax moves are too little, too late and in no way make us competitive in terms of what is happening to new companies and the CGT treatment they receive in the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  One of the striking things about current industrial and employment policy is how little it has changed.\u00a0 The core strategies of the main agencies are largely those which were put in place a decade ago.\u00a0 They target the same general activities and have evolved rather than reinvented supports.\u00a0 Given just how much has changed in this period, this suggests we need more innovation in policy and less innovation in publicity.  A long-term policy which has unequivocally worked for Ireland is the decision to invest heavily in advanced research.\u00a0 When the last Fine Gael-Labour Party Government left office, the entire dedicated budget for basic research in the education sector was zero.<\/p><p>In the following decade this area was transformed.  It dramatically improved the work of our universities and provided the foundation for the huge expansion in research activity in business.  The budget documents talk solely about activities already in place, so we must assume that this Government&rsquo;s policy of drift and damage to our research base is going to continue.  In an unprecedented petition signed by 800 scientists earlier this year the Government was warned that some of the best scientists who have ever worked on this island are leaving because of a short-sighted and damaging set of policies implemented by the Government.  The so-called new world class research centres are anything but new.  Most of them were established 12 years ago and all are funded under a competition launched over five years ago.<\/p> <p> Basic research, which is funded in every country that has a high standard of living, is being undermined.  One research centre which is ranked first in the world in the critical area of immunology was refused funding because of this Government&rsquo;s policy.  Professor Bill Campbell is the first Irishman to win a Nobel Prize in a science area for 64 years.  This Government&rsquo;s policy means that his studies could not be funded in Ireland.  Clearly, the Government decided that there were not enough votes to be bought in committing to long-term industrial and research policies, and our country will suffer as a result.<\/p> <p> Before she became leader of the Labour Party, the T&aacute;naiste went to great lengths to present herself as a radical alternative to Deputy Gilmore.  However, beyond this rhetoric was the reality of a Minister implementing cuts which were almost designed to maximise the hurt which they caused.  After this budget, 38 of the 40 major cuts implemented in social protection schemes will remain in place.

She had to leave the workforce to look after her elderly mother and aunt for a number of years.  In previous years she would have been eligible for a pension as her contributions would have been up to the criterion.  However, she could not believe it when she discovered that she was no longer entitled, because of the sneaky change introduced by the Labour Party and Fine Gael in 2012.  That is the reason older people among the public are angry.  They can see through all the fog and spin in their daily lives.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, announced the end of the private pensions levy as if it were some major concession.  It has been both socially and economically damaging.  It was morally wrong.  Many people with pension funds outside the public service are very angry about what was done.  Their pensions were raided, with no planning put in place for the pensions crisis that is about to hit us.  It was a bad policy which probably cost the State more than it collected due to reduced investment.  It should never have been introduced in the first place.  Overall, no significant improvements or reforms have been proposed for social protection, which is an appropriate symbol of five years of neglect and regressive cuts by this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Child care is another area where the Government continues to make it up as it goes along.  It clearly decided that it had to announce something on child care but it was unable or unwilling to do it comprehensively.  The announced scheme is a mess which does not extend child care in a sustainable way.  Three hours of care for 38 weeks a year means that working parents will still have to put in place almost full-time arrangements paid for from their own pockets.  A comprehensive child care system is urgently needed and it is affordable.  That is the reason Fianna F&aacute;il gave priority to child care in its budget proposals.  I have no doubt that this will be a major issue during the coming election campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael and the Labour Party spent four years sitting on their hands as an entirely avoidable housing emergency developed.  As soon as public outrage reached boiling point they started announcing emergency measures.  Yesterday, we had the sixth housing announcement of 2015.  It is still too little and too late.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, made the entirely false claim last night that, &ldquo;there was not a single social housing unit built under Fianna F&aacute;il&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400018#Q02600","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444824000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Untrue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400018#Q02700","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1444824000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>In fact, in every year under Fianna F&aacute;il the funding and output of social housing was higher than in any year of this Government's term.  This year, with a housing and homelessness emergency under way, the allocation is less than one third of the allocation in 2010.<\/p><p>The Government is the sole author of the housing emergency.  The T&aacute;naiste instituted cuts and denied any change to the rent supplement scheme, which directly drove, and is still driving, people out of homes.  The Government had projections of housing demand but did nothing.  It failed even to plan, let alone fund, urgently needed housing units.  Ten local authorities have not built a single house this year.  There are 1,500 children in emergency accommodation.  This is a national disgrace.<\/p><p>The failures of the Government on housing have been so complete that it has resorted to fixing the figures.  There are 130,000 households on the social housing list, 40% higher than the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, will admit.  Did the sixth housing announcement of the year provide a route to meeting the social housing need or making home ownership affordable for the squeezed middle?  No, it did not.  It was another policy soundbite designed to get through a tricky period.<\/p><p>The Government ends its term with a full-scale crisis in the health system and no idea how to deal with it.  First, it said it had the answer to everything and the Taoiseach claimed that everything was heading in the right direction.  Last year, he made a scapegoat of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and installed a new tough-talking Minister who said he would quickly get things under control as he had a better bedside manner.  There have been two massive supplementary budgets, trolley crises in emergency departments, waiting times and waiting lists exploding even after they have been manipulated downwards and chaos in recruitment to vital jobs.  This is what the new broom has delivered.  In fact, he has seen a 550% increase in inpatient day cases which are waiting for over a year.  Today, his principal policy appears to be, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to deal with it but heads will roll if you embarrass me this winter.&rdquo;  That is his new policy.  Clearly, this is the reason he was a leading member of the November election caucus.<\/p><p>The budget provides for no significant new activity in health next year.  Simply put, the rate of decline is being managed.  A few million euro is being thrown at a GP card initiative which will almost inevitably not be delivered next year.  Other than that, nothing new is promised.  The size of the supplementary budgets is not due to a failure by professionals in the system, but to political decisions.  For three years Ministers have demanded that the HSE promise certain levels of service but have refused to provide the required funds.  That is the reason the funding runs out early and there is growing inefficiency in the planning of services.  There has been dishonesty and fraudulent behaviour at the heart of health budgets over the last three years.  That is why the discretionary medical card debacle occurred, and the distress it caused thousands of families.  It is a shame on the Taoiseach that young children lost their discretionary medical cards because he did not provide money for them in the budget that year.  Like the housing emergency, it is a crisis caused directly by Ministers.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Fine Gael has committed itself to running the most negative re-election campaign of any Irish Government.  As part of this, it has apparently produced a booklet and memorandum outlining attacks which should be made on me for my time as Minister for Health.  One of these attacks is that I supposedly was not able to control spending.  The Taoiseach might wish to update that given that this year&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate is ten times the size of the one in my last full year in that Department, and that came from increased demand not unplanned services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400018#Q02800","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444824600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Bring it on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400019#R00100","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1444824600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The House should also remember that two years ago, the Taoiseach told us he was taking personal charge of ensuring that health stayed within budget and that there would be no more supplementaries.\u00a0  Some &euro;1.2 billion later, he has some explaining to do.

For all the posters promising no more trolleys and instant access for everyone, its health policies have been a shambles.  I look forward to this being a core issue in the general election.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has introduced the tactic of announcing allocations which are automatic due to demographic changes as being \"new\" or \"extra\".  The great bulk of the additional allocation to education is to cater for growth in pupil numbers, what we once called the \"demographic dividend\" and which was not even fought for between Ministers.  For other improvements, the fact that only a third of a year needs to be shown in the 2016 figures has allowed Ministers to try and take the bare look off what has been a consistent targeting of education for disproportionate cuts.  The bulk of the most regressive cuts, such as to guidance counsellors for disadvantaged schools and the abolition of postgraduate grants for poorer students, remains fully in place and part of a legacy on education of neglect and drift.<\/p>  <p>  It was a brave decision of the Government to send its Ministers into the House to speak for over an hour but not once mention the biggest political and budgetary fiasco of many years.

They are also about the interests that a government seeks to represent.  Budget 2016 shows once again that Fine Gael and, to its very great shame, the Labour Party, represent the interests of the privileged few in Irish society.  Following the calamity of the economic crash under the last Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, Fine Gael and Labour assumed office with a huge mandate for political change.  However, as citizens have learned to their cost, nothing has changed.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in yesterday's budget.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2016 is an election budget, focused entirely on the short term, without strategic considerations for the longer term or for the public good.  In its budget, the Government mimics exactly the boom-bust approach of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is as brazen in playing for electoral advantage as any Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Its budget is a cynical ploy to throw crumbs to specific interest groups in an effort to secure re-election in the months ahead.  Sin &eacute;.  Ach n&iacute;l muintir na t&iacute;re seo chomh d&uacute;r sin.  C&eacute; go s&iacute;leann an Rialtas seo gur amad&aacute;in iad, le blianta beaga anuas t&aacute; ciall cheannaithe ag go leor saor&aacute;nach.<\/p>  <p>  Since entering Government, Fine Gael and Labour have picked up where Fianna F&aacute;il left off, targeting average families and vulnerable citizens for cruel cuts and unfair taxes like water charges and the family home tax.  The Government likes to talk about a recovery but average families have not seen much evidence of this recovery.  It is true that things have got better for some but, for the vast majority, little has changed.  T&aacute; an t&eacute;arnamh seo, mar dhea, m&iacute;-ch&oacute;ir agus m&iacute;-chothrom.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has unnecessarily prolonged the recession for the vast majority of our people.  It has also caused huge damage to our public services and local communities, and its budget does not wipe that slate clean.  The adverse social consequences of eight years of austerity budgets, first by Fianna F&aacute;il and subsequently by Fine Gael and Labour, will take years to resolve.  In successive budgets, Fine Gael and Labour have attacked the most vulnerable.  I will give a snapshot of their high achievement.  They indiscriminately imposed a blanket water tax and family home tax and they abolished the &euro;300 cost of education allowance.   They cut jobseeker's allowance and were only short of packing the bags of young people and driving them to the airport to encourage them to leave.  They cut child benefit despite promises to the contrary, cut the back to school allowance, cut the fuel allowance by six weeks, or &euro;120, and cut the respite care grant by &euro;325.  They introduced a tax on maternity benefit and abolished the bereavement grant.  They cut invalidity pension for 65 year olds by &euro;36.80 per week, cut rent supplement and cut the household benefits package.  In total, in its first three budgets the Government slashed the education budget by &euro;500 million and the health budget by &euro;2.5 billion.  That is some record.<\/p>  <p>   Budget 2016 is a progression of the Government's socially delinquent approach, this time motivated by electoral considerations rather than done under the cover of the troika.  It introduced more tax cuts that favour higher earners, and there has been more starving of public services and badly needed investment.  The current crises in health and housing are not accidental but are a direct result of the policies of Fine Gael and Labour in government.  Let us not forget that those people who lie on trolleys in accident and emergency wards are our own family members, our neighbours and our friends.  They did not drop from outer space - they are us.  Those households in mortgage distress and the citizens who find themselves homeless - they too are us.  So too the 500,000 citizens scattered across the globe as a result of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour emigration policy.  The Government has a duty to protect and defend the rights and entitlements of citizens; that is its first call.  Instead, the Government has repeatedly attacked those rights and entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of five years of Fine Gael-Labour Government, our society has become ever more polarised and unequal.  This should be a matter of deep shame for the T&aacute;naiste and the Labour Party.  Budget 2016 again sees Fine Gael and Labour perpetuating a lie that it is possible to reduce the overall tax take, possible to stand off high earners and wealth, while at the same time maintaining and building front-line services.  It is a lie.<\/p><p> Budget 2016 makes high earners the winners while average families and those citizens most dependent on public services lose out yet again.  For all of the Government's fine talk, here are the figures.  The budget gives to a person earning &euro;25,000, in or around the norm in the economy, &euro;227 per annum, just over &euro;4 a week.  However, for individuals earning over &euro;70,000, it puts over &euro;900 back into their pockets, three times more.  Yet the Government talks about fairness and equity.  By reducing capital gains tax by 13% and reducing tax on wealth, the Government is again dismantling the tax base.  Its tax reduction measures will reduce the money available to the State by &euro;882 million.  At the same time, it puts &euro;181.9 million of tax back into the pockets of the top 14% of earners and talks about equity and recovery. <\/p> <p> How does any of this help the average family, the people who have borne the brunt of the economic and financial crash?  Income inequality has deepened on the Government's watch, under the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.  The Labour Party has shamelessly abandoned average workers and the vulnerable.  It has refused to take action on low hour contracts or on the unacceptably high levels of low paid and insecure jobs.  We now live in an increasingly low pay and poverty wage economy.  The Labour Party leader and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has cruelly targeted lone parents and unemployed young people for vicious cuts.  She seems to hold a special kind of disdain for those particular groups of citizens.<\/p> <p> This State's taxation system is deeply inequitable.  We speak about progressivity in income tax, but taken in the round, the system is inequitable.  Budget 2016 benefits the top 14% of earners.  The Government cannot say that is equitable.  For the low paid, budget 2016 gives a meagre increase of 50 cent in the national minimum wage.  This will come not from Government coffers, but from employers.  The Government will not lead as it should and has nothing to say about the need for a living wage.  In real terms, there has been no increase in the minimum wage since 2007.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed to increase the minimum wage by &euro;1 per hour, bringing a full-time minimum wage up to &euro;19,572 a year.  We would increase employee and employer PRSI bands in line with this increase.  We support the introduction of the living wage and believe that as the largest employer, the State should lead the way on this.<\/p> <p> I am sorry the T&aacute;naiste has left the Chamber.  It may come as news to her that contrary to her assertion earlier, the emergency is not over.  The Government has presided over chaos in the health system.  Some 7,775 citizens lay on trolleys in our accident and emergency departments last June, the highest recorded level of overcrowding in the month of June since the trolley watch count began 12 years ago.  This is shocking.  In July, we witnessed a 94% increase in trolley numbers in emergency departments since 2006.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, in Drogheda, with 769 patients on trolleys, had the highest levels of overcrowding in the State.  Yesterday, as the Budget Statement was announced here, there were 469 citizens on hospital trolleys.  There were 47 patients on trolleys in Beaumont and 16 in the Mater in my neighbourhood.  This chaos is not accidental but is a result of Government policy and is an indictment of its term in office and of those policies.  Budget 2016 does nothing to address the crisis.  Listening to both Ministers yesterday, one would never imagine there was an issue of resources or fadhb ar bith in the health service.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in's budget proposals, which I am sorry to hear the T&aacute;naiste had difficulty reading, set out an additional &euro;383 million in health funding.  This would provide for additional nursing staff, consultants, dentists, orthodontists, speech therapists and occupational therapists.  It would allow increases in funding to disability and mental health services and would increase essential ambulance cover.  What did the Government propose?  When we go through the data and cut through the spin, we see it has allocated &euro;18 million, a paltry sum, of an additional spend for health.  Within that, it proposes to extend free GP cover to children under 12, those between six and 11.  This is the most cynical of election stunts.<\/p> <p> Many seriously sick and vulnerable citizens, including children and young adults, continue to go without medical cards.  As the Taoiseach may recall, we had the unedifying episodes of discretionary medical cards being taken from seriously ill and disabled children.  Under the Government's new scheme, very sick children of all ages and their families will still be forced to beg and plead for a full medical card.  How revealing is this?  How revealing it is that the Government favours a headline grabbing announcement over an initiative that would give cover and care to seriously sick children and children with severe disabilities.  So much for this budget being child friendly.<\/p> <p> In regard to cost, the budget allocates &euro;10 million to the GP initiative.  This is odd, because the costing available to Sinn F&eacute;in for such an initiative amounted to &euro;39 million.  Riddle us that.  I believe that is further evidence of the fact that this is a stunt.  It has nothing to do with assisting children who need their medical needs addressed.  It has nothing to do with assisting families who go through the horror of caring for a very sick child.  Perhaps we should not be surprised, because the Government has previous form in this regard.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach had a lot to say earlier, as did the T&aacute;naiste, about older citizens.  They seem to regard themselves as knights riding to the assistance of senior citizens, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Yesterday, the Government did nothing in the budget regarding prescription charges.  If there is one issue consistently raised by older citizens, it is the issue of prescription charges.  Elderly citizens are now being forced to decide which medicines to take because the prescription charge is so high, at &euro;2.50 per item.  Where now stands the 2012 promise to abolish prescription charges?  Far from abolishing them, the Government has presided over a 400% increase in the charge.  This has caused serious hardship and is jeopardising people's health and well-being.<\/p> <p> The Government made a drama last week of its plans for capital spending of &euro;27 billion over six years.  However, let it be recorded here again that next year, the Government will cut capital spending by more than &euro;50 million.  What is the logic for that?<\/p><p>The mind boggles.  I suppose the Taoiseach had his outing in the media so now he will go about his actual intentions.<\/p> <p> Faoin Rialtas seo, chuaigh g&eacute;arch&eacute;im na tith&iacute;ochta in olcas go m&oacute;r.  Fine Gael and Labour have abandoned the provision of social housing to the private sector and we can see the disastrous results.  We have 130,000 families in need of housing and on social housing lists.  Nearly 1,500 children are in emergency accommodation.  No matter how often that is said, it is still so shocking.<\/p> <p> Rents have gone up by 35% since 2011, outstripping Celtic tiger levels.  We need a level of investment to which this Government is simply unwilling to commit, so the crisis will continue.  That is the prognosis.  From any reading of its announcements yesterday one could arrive at no other conclusion.<\/p> <p> The additional &euro;69 million announced by the Government yesterday is less than a quarter of what it cut from the housing budget in 2012.  Was the Taoiseach aware of that?  Again in 2013 the Government halved funding to local authority housing, and cut another 10% in 2014.  We wonder why we have an emergency now.  With homeless citizens dying on the streets very close to the D&aacute;il, I really wonder what it will take before this Government acknowledges the scale of this catastrophe.  Sinn F&eacute;in has provided for an extra &euro;300 million investment for 2016 in social housing delivering almost 1,700 units in addition to existing Government plans.<\/p> <p> The Government will not do that because it chooses not to.  It also failed to announce rent certainty as part of the budget.  Meanwhile many landlords have seen an opportunity in the current crisis and have hiked up rents.  As a direct result of their actions and, more importantly, the Government's inaction, children and their families are now homeless.<\/p> <p> The Government did nothing about the bank levy, despite all its previous tough talking and shape throwing.  There will be no legislation to let the Central Bank set a cap on rip-off mortgage rates.  The 300,000 mortgage holders with standard variable rate mortgages have been abandoned by this Government.  We see again that this is a Government of the banks and for the banks.<\/p> <p> The Government tells us that NAMA will build houses.  Many in Sinn F&eacute;in have been calling on NAMA to activate and honour its social obligations for many years.  Those pleas fell on deaf ears.  Let it be said that, if delivered, only a tiny proportion of those houses will come back in the form of social or affordable housing.  Again, the Government is relying on private developers making a buck in respect of housing provision.<\/p> <p> I would like to know what the Government proposes to do around the funding of Tusla in general, and specifically in respect of the fact that 80% of women fleeing domestic violence were turned away from Dublin refuges in the first three months of this year.  Many of those women have children and they were turned away.  I want to know where the money is for that, and where the Taoiseach's commitment is.  There was no mention of it yesterday although many of these refuge facilities are in imminent danger of closure.  It was not worthy of mention in the budget.  We know that without these services many women and children will be forced into homelessness or, heaven forbid, worse.<\/p> <p> The Government's announcement on child care falls very short of the Scandinavian model benchmark so beloved by the T&aacute;naiste.  It is proposed to provide an additional 50 weeks in respect of any individual child between the ages of three and five and a half.  Although any advance in child care is welcome, let us be clear that the system as it exists is sessional and therefore very part-time.  The capitation rates afforded for the scheme are absolutely inadequate and are causing huge difficulties in terms of staffing.  The experience of children with special needs and disabilities has been in many cases one of exclusion from this scheme.  The Government has now committed to remedying that position and I hope that it will be true to that commitment when we see the details.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in's budget proposals also provided for an additional six weeks maternity benefit that can be taken by either parent in addition to paternity leave.  I am very disappointed that the Government did not do something in that regard.<\/p> <p> The only positive move regarding education in the budget is the decrease to the pupil teacher ratio.  There was no increase in school capitation grants, which leaves schools in very great difficulties.  I heard no mention of increasing funds for DEIS schools or, importantly, of reducing the student contribution fee.  The cut of 15% to resource hours across the system has been devastating.  The Government's partial announcement does not come close to reversing that cut.<\/p> <p> Rural Ireland has been under sustained attack over the past number of years.  Fine Gael and Labour have presided over the closure of Garda stations, schools and post offices, the shutting down of hospitals and of other local services.  The budget does nothing to reverse this attack on rural Ireland.  Our pre-budget submission proposed that farm assist be restored to pre-2013 levels in terms of assessment of means and income deductions in respect of children.  We also proposed additional places in the rural social scheme by 20%.  None of these measures was introduced by the Government.  While some of the measures announced, such as capital gains tax and stamp duty exemptions for young farmers being extended beyond next year, are to be welcomed there is nothing from this Government for struggling small farmers.  The USC reduction of 0.5% will apply to most small farmers who earn less than the lower limit, while the bigger farmers will benefit to the tune of 2.5% on incomes up to &euro;70,044.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400019#R00500","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444825800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>What about the genomics and GLAS schemes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400021#T00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444825800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Not a single new garda was trained between 2010 and 2013.

That leaves a net gain of 200, far short of the announcement.<\/p>  <p>  Since entering Government, Fine Gael and Labour have cut the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by nearly 10%.  That is a truly shocking statistic, especially given the sustained attacks in rural Ireland by organised criminal gangs.

Those being forced to pay the price for the Government's policies are families on low and middle incomes.  Those paying the price are families put to the pin of their collar by the family home tax and water charges.  They are the 500,000 people who have emigrated since 2008.  Young people are continuing to leave in their droves because of poor opportunities, low wages and a lack of access to housing and child care.<\/p>  <p>  Those paying for the Government's austerity policies include lone parents.<\/p><p>They are the thousands of seriously ill and disabled children and adults who have had their discretionary medical cards withdrawn.  Those paying are sick people forced to go without medicine because of the introduction of prescription charges.  The price is being paid by those who use our public hospitals where one in eight patients on a waiting list is in the queue for over a year.  Some people are waiting up to four years to see a consultant.  That is some record.  The price is being paid by the 130,000 families on the social housing waiting lists and the 100,000 households in mortgage arrears.  Legal proceedings to repossess homes have increased tenfold.  Rents are still increasing and the number of homeless children continues to rise.<\/p> <p> While all these people have paid the price of Government policies, who did Fine Gael and the Labour Party protect?  They certainly protected the property developers.  NAMA has been allowed to pay developers salaries of &euro;200,000 a year while medical cards were being stripped from children.  The Government protected the bondholders.  Billions of euro have been paid to international junior and senior bondholders who gambled on unstable banks while the Government broke its social contract with Irish citizens.  The Government also protected the vulture capitalists.  Billions of euro worth of Irish assets are being subjected to a fire sale while the citizen picks up the losses.<\/p> <p> The Government protected the tiny wealthy elite in this State.  Wealth tax and tax relief loopholes have been allowed to continue.  It protected the banks.  A total of &euro;64 billion of public money was pumped into the banks and then bank CEOs were allowed to pay themselves salaries of &euro;800,000 a year while threatening families with eviction.  The Government abjectly refused to get a resolution to the problem of legacy debt.  That is its legacy.  It protected the golden circle.  Just like Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party continued political appointments to State boards and failed to act on high salaries for politicians and those in banking and State bodies.  <\/p> <p> Meanwhile, the Government has ignored the demands of hundreds of thousands of citizens who have taken to the streets again and again to demand it scraps domestic water charges.  It should have done so yesterday.  The water charges issue has not gone away, you know.  It has become a catalyst for popular discontent against the Government.  The community mobilisations have been extraordinary and a real example of genuine, active citizenship.  Those who have been politicised will not now meekly back down in the face of Government bribes, slander or intimidation.  The major mobilisations we have seen are not just against water charges.  They are against the blind, relentless pursuit of a failed austerity agenda.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has characterised the forthcoming election as a choice between stability and chaos but there is no stability for low-paid workers or those on zero-hour contracts.  There is no stability for those patients and front-line workers facing chaos in our hospital accident and emergency departments.  There is no stability for those families facing the prospect of losing their home.  This Government's idea of stability is very different to that held by most citizens.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste's notion of stability is the maintenance of a deeply unequal and dysfunctional status quo.  That is not the stability our people need or want.  This Government has used its huge D&aacute;il majority to attack the rights and welfare of struggling families and vulnerable citizens in complete contradiction of its 2011 election promises.  <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach should think of this phrase \"fool me once-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400021#T00300","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444826400,"counter":340,"content":"<p>&quot;Shame on you&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400022#U00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444826400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>&quot;Fool me twice, shame on me&quot;.

Since I have been in the D&aacute;il and since the Government took office, it has been the tradition to introduce a range of measures that will cumulatively advance us even further towards an Irish society of two very distinct halves - the rich and the poor or the haves and the have-nots.  There was the usual attempt to portray a fair and balanced fiscal outlook but there has been nothing fair about the austerity foisted upon the Irish people through what I would call a bad political decision and bad political decisions in recent years.  Yesterday's poor attempt to buy back votes with scraps was a further insult to the intelligence of very many people.  Does the Government honestly believe people's memories are that short and that they can be dazzled by a couple of euro a week when their children are still living in exile in forced emigration, when their friends are losing the roof over their heads and when their neighbours are lying in pain on a hospital trolley waiting for a bed?<\/p>  <p>  The big fanfare in the budget surrounded the USC \"bonanza\", as one newspaper called it and as the Government would like to portray it, and how it will give back squeezed middle-income earners around &euro;10 a week.  If one thinks of that, it is a princely sum of their own hard-earned money that will be quickly soaked up and taken away by water charges, household charges and, of course, all the other indirect taxes.  It is a case of fingers crossed on the part of the Government that these people will be so overwhelmed with paying a percentage less that they will forget this tax was only intended to be a temporary measure in the first place.<\/p>  <p>   Speaking of the squeezed middle, I am very disappointed at the Government's attempt to portray this budget as the antidote that hard-pressed working families have been waiting for.  Granted, the additional 23 weeks of free preschool will benefit a significant number of families but what about those working parents whose children have already turned three years of age, many of whom have been speaking on the radio this morning?  It is too late for these people to benefit from this measure.  Ireland is now the most expensive country in the world for child care yet, astonishingly, there was no attempt in this budget to introduce measures aimed at universally affordable and accessible child care for middle-income earners who are currently forking out approximately &euro;1,000 per month.  There is a wholly inadequate &euro;3-million allocation to support after-school services which I cannot see stretching very far.  The school year only runs for 37 or so weeks of the year so what are working parents supposed to do outside term time?  Young working parents have borne the brunt of the recession and they have been left hanging by this budget.  It is not good enough.  We have again turned our backs on even adequate child care services in this country.  <\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that the Minister for Finance said yesterday that the cost of renting accommodation was not a budgetary matter.  This was an astounding statement to make.  His reasoning behind not addressing rent controls or the price of rent was that he did not want to interfere and make matters worse than they already were.  This is exactly what he said.  One wonders just how much worse things will get before the Government faces up to the homelessness crisis.  There are thousands of young adults over the age of 18 who are living with their parents and sleeping in sitting rooms and kitchens who consider themselves homeless so there are far more homeless people than those we define as being homeless.  It is widely documented that the substantial gap between rent supplement and the famous housing assistance payment, HAP, and the actual rents being sought is causing homelessness and will continue to do so.  I do not understand why the Government has not taken up the results of a survey carried out earlier this year that showed that only 12% of rental properties were available within rent supplement or HAP limits.<\/p><p>It is not working.  The HAP is a complete failure and people in housing offices all over the country are saying the same thing.  They may not say it publicly because it is not advisable to do so, but they tell me it is an absolute failure. <\/p> <p> Threshold's Dublin tenancy protection service states the additional annual cost of providing 744 households in the capital with an increased rent supplement payment, to prevent them from becoming homeless, was, amazingly, &euro;800,000.  By comparison, &euro;1.6 million was spent in providing emergency hotel accommodation for 361 homeless families in the Dublin region in July 2015 alone.  Who balanced the books?  Who came up with this in the budget?  It is absolutely outrageous.  If this is not a budgetary issue, as the Minister for Finance said yesterday, I do not know where he is going.  I could not believe he had said it.  <\/p> <p> Another supposed \"giveaway\" yesterday that voters were quick to see through was the &euro;3 per week increase for pensioners.  The Government will hand pensioners three coins.  That increase is negated immediately by failing to restore the lifeline that was the telephone allowance.  Irish telephone costs are the sixth highest in Europe.  The prescription charge has not been touched, which means that &euro;1.50 is already gone because the charge rose over two years, while the meagre increase in the fuel allowance does not even restore the allowance to 2009 levels.  In 1994, 5.9% of people in the country aged 65 years or older were at risk of poverty.  Today the figure stands at 9.7% and this number will continue to increase, unless the Government rethinks its policy towards the elderly.  It is not enough to throw an extra few euro at pensioners when a general election is looming.  A person living on the State pension - all the statistics show this - is down &euro;700 since 2008 in allowances and benefits and that is without taking into account the rising costs of living and increases in charges and taxes.  Neither was any attempt made to replace the 2.34 million home help hours lost since 2008, on which elderly people are so reliant.<\/p> <p> We need to move towards a progressive model that will tackle income inequality among the elderly such as a universal State pension, about which the Labour Party and other groups, including Social Justice Ireland, have spoken.  Such a system would be financed not by increasing tax rates but by adjusting the current system, principally by making tax breaks for pension contributions available to everyone at the standard rate of rate and curbing tax benefits on private pensions that favour higher earners.  This model has been costed by accountants in recent years and I am taken aback that the Government has not considered doing this. <\/p> <p> There is an error in the budget submission on health.  The Minister said the &euro;13.5 billion allocated to the health service this year had brought it back to crisis levels.  He obviously did not get his facts and figures correct because I checked back and in 2008 the Government allocated &euro;15.5 billion.  That was when the crisis was beginning and the health service was in crisis in 2008.  Even now it cannot get a consultant to work 24 hours or in a hospital at weekends.  Waterford General Hospital cannot get one to work at weekends.  How can we deal with a health service which cannot provide rudimentary services?  Young workers are forced to work for the minimum wage and if they do not do this and work terrible hours, their social welfare payments are cut off.  Consultants on big earnings say they will not work beyond 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. on a Friday.  They said it to the previous Government, too.  Patients can forget about seeing a cardiac consultant after 5 p.m. in some hospitals.  If he or she is on call somewhere, the hospital may or may not be able to get him or her to come back if a patient has a heart attack.  <\/p> <p> The Budget Statement refers to a spend of &euro;13.5 billion, but it is not all a question of money.  Medicines here are the most expensive in Europe and this has been said for 20 or 30 years.  The Minister was completely wrong when he said yesterday that &euro;13.5 billion was a huge sum that had never been given before.  The previous Government invested &euro;15.5 billion in 2008 when the health service started to go into absolute decline; therefore, it is not a question of money.  The Government cannot deal with the essentials in the health service, providing care and making those paid to provide it such as the consultants do so.  It cannot force pharmacists to bring down the price of prescription medications.  Pharmacists are supposed to tell the customer about the generic brand available, but three quarters of them do not do so.  We are at nothing in the health service when the Government is afraid to deal with the consultants and the cost of running the service.<\/p> <p> I agree with the Labour Party that we should be aiming towards providing free health care.  We should allocate &euro;10 million, but all of this is subject to negotiation with the doctors' representatives, which means that the parents of a 12 year old child had better not hold their breath.  When the Government tries to negotiate with doctors on this issue, the first thing they will want to know is how they will make or lose money.  The Government should not have proposed this measure.  It was economical with the truth to the electorate.  It should have sorted out this issue.  It would have meant a lot to people if it had been able to say \"we have already concluded the negotiations and can do this now.\"  It gives people the impression that if they have a 12 year old child, he or she can have free GP care, but that will not happen within two or three years, as the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, knows as well as I do.  The Government will not do this next year or even the year after that.<\/p> <p> I do not like to be personal and critical of the budget.  There are some good things in it, but an opportunity has been missed again.  It gave back &euro;1.5 billion, but &euro;30 billion has been taken out of people's pay packets and through cuts in welfare services and so on over five years and it is not an awful lot to give back.  A country is judged on how it treats the most vulnerable in its society, not those who have sufficient money to get by, but its most vulnerable.  There are between 130,000 and 150,000 people on housing lists and people have been waiting four and five years for a medical procedure.  It might be eight or nine months before they get to see a consultant.  One in ten children goes to school impoverished.  The Government has spent four years firing all hell on austerity.  It has an opportunity to give back &euro;1.5 billion, but it has not done that; it has not dealt with the people who need money.  People come into my office every day of the week distressed because they cannot pay their mortgages.  There were 800 facing eviction in the past two weeks.  That is not the way it was supposed to be when the Government took office.  It was supposed to deal with that issue and to protect people who, through no fault of their own, were losing their houses, but that has all gone by the wayside.  They cannot now be protected.  They are at the behest of a judge who will decide whether they should be evicted or be given a stay of execution.  <\/p> <p> The Government has underestimated the people if it thinks they will be bought by the budget.  A conservative elderly lady said to me last week that the budget would not be like the last five or six when things were good and we were bought and sold.  She said people were going to be analytical and examine this budget, what they would lose and what they should have got back.  I understand the Government could not have given back &euro;30 billion, but the redistribution of the money is unfair.  This will come to pass in the next couple of months or shortly when people in the next few days analyse exactly what they have been given and what they should have received.  It will not be seen as a favourable budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400022#U00400","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444827600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The main function of a budget is to create an environment for job creation and the retention of jobs.  It is also to have a balanced and equitable regional spread of jobs and job incentivisation measures.  We have failed in this budget as these issues have not been addressed.  Giving people their dignity is pivotal in life, to which a job is essential.  I do not mean Mickey Mouse stuff such as zero hour contracts - we should strive at all times to give sustainable work and put a roof over people's heads.  People need sustenance for themselves and their families.<\/p>  <p>  There is a gradual recovery, but it is still fragile.  Full-time sustainable jobs are paramount to the needs of our abundant workforce, but many people are in long-term unemployment and in a situation which seems to be endless and with very few, if any, possibilities of finding something satisfactory.  They are demoralised and this has a general effect on their well-being, health and status within their communities.  Graduates are faced with a lack of suitable opportunities to participate in the recovery of the country.  <\/p>  <p>  Some of our emigrants may wish to return, but they are still sceptical about it and the prospects of eking out a viable livelihood in this country.  Vital infrastructure is important, but there is a lack of quality broadband.  Whether one is in Toronto, Sydney or Birmingham, a person can at least access Internet services at the press of a button, but people here are bewildered at the state of this vital necessity.  It is a major disincentive to return when we should be incentivising them.  People see broadband as an entitlement which they have other countries; therefore, the standard of the service here does not entice them to come back in great numbers.  We need them to build on the recovery in the short term.  Otherwise, we will restrict their options to come back and eke out a living here.  Their exodus was followed by a decline in rural Ireland and the entire rural fabric was affected.  <\/p>  <p>  There is an urgent need to send the right message to the youth of the country by reinstating the social welfare rate that was payable previously.  It was reduced to &euro;100 and needed to be corrected.  It is a huge blow to unemployed youth who are a very disaffected cohort.  Many of them are well educated and qualified, yet they are forced to live at home for prolonged periods, which is not very desirable.  It is not acceptable and leads to internal problems within households when a young person is not independent and cannot make a living on his or her own.  It is wrong of the Government not to recognise this and correct it.  I plead with the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste to reconsider bringing the rate back to the normal figure to give the young people concerned an adequate opportunity.  Those on &euro;100 a week cannot afford to send all of the documentation they are required to send because of the cost of stamping envelopes or getting a taxi to seek work in the next town 15 miles away.  Public transport is not available in some places and young people cannot afford to pay for their own transport, unless they use a bicycle to travel the 20 miles they may need to travel to attend a job interview.<\/p>  <p>  Action needs to be taken on the regional property programme and regional action plans.  My own peripheral county in the south west has been deprived and neglected for too long.  We listen to announcements every day for the large centres of Dublin and Cork city.  It is very fortunate for us that Cork city is benefiting from measures and we also gain when Limerick benefits, but we still feel we are the forgotten people and I cannot see anything tangible in the budget to make our situation any better.  Lip-service is paid to regional property programmes and action plans and there is a lack of specifics.  It would be great if some specific measures were outlined in the budget to target the south west, including County Kerry, or County Donegal or County Waterford with action plans, but it is just smoke and mirrors and will eventually all be forgotten about.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to set out a decisive action programme.  I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of trips the Minister has organised to County Kerry for investors in the past five years.  There may have been one or two, but it would be interesting to know what the purpose of the visits was, or if the people involved stayed for a whole day or just two or three hours, following which they left the county again, making it no more than an excuse of a trip.<\/p>  <p>  We need a regional spread of jobs.  We are fortunate in having good SMEs in the county, some of which started with five, six or ten jobs, but they now have 100 or more.  We have some wonderful examples of firms which have been highly successful because they have a diligent, well qualified workforce.  There is an institute of technology in Tralee, with a huge number of graduates coming out every year into the catchment area.  We also have students who attend Cork Institute of Technology and Limerick Institute of Technology and they want to come back to their own county and communities.  Companies such as Killarney Plastics, Fexco, Munster Joinery and Harty's in Causeway are all flagship projects and successful employers.<\/p><p>I am glad to see the self-employed, the smaller outlets, are being given a bit of a break in badly needed tax breaks.  Farmers, who form the backbone of rural Ireland, will also avail of some positivity in the budget in that respect, which is a start anyway.<\/p> <p> However, those self-employed people are still being discriminated against in social welfare benefits and they have been badly let down again.  I thought this issue would have been addressed.  Many people who have to close up their shops have no income.  People have suffered in the crash over the past six or seven years, in particular.  They have been the lifeblood of their communities, keeping great life in small towns and villages.  They were family businesses as well and it is sad to see these people out on the street.  The fate of some of them was worse in that they lost their homes as well as losing their businesses.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health called for &euro;1 billion to give an immediate injection - pardon the pun - into the health service.  I believe he was quite right.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is doing her utmost for disability services, for instance, but she is battling against the tide.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is faced with shortages in acute beds with the domino effect of shortages down the line in community hospitals.  The lack of step-down beds is resulting in trolleys in the corridors, which is unacceptable.  There are long waiting lists for various procedures, diagnostics, etc.<\/p> <p> Earlier I mentioned how essential jobs are, but health is a priority for everybody, including a six-day old baby or a 99-year old person.  The least we can do is to look after people properly in a timely fashion, but that is not happening.  The Minister for Health called for &euro;1 billion to wipe the slate clean.  I believe it could be done over six months if it happened.  When we had surplus funding, we certainly could have gone 80% of the way anyway.  There is a lot of wastage and that will need to be addressed in tandem with the provision of more money.  This was a call from the Minister and I think it could have been achieved but unfortunately, it has not been addressed in this budget.<\/p> <p> On community care services, we need to get back to basics regarding our elderly population.  The gain in the budget is welcome and they appreciate it very much.  The Christmas bonus is something for people.  After seven or eight hard budgets, it gives them a bit of hope and will give them a bit of comfort coming up to Christmas.<\/p> <p> Respite is very welcome, of course.  People providing respite care selflessly are really the heroes.  What I will say about the &euro;3 is that the carbon tax has affected many people in terms of their fuel needs in recent years and this is a bit of a return.  We cannot forget family resource centres.  They are certainly in need of a bit of extra funding in the budget and the same applies to all the disability services.  The upkeep of the home help service is crucial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400024#W00100","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1444828200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.15 p.m. and resumed at 3.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1444828500,"counter":347,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Finance said yesterday, the previous few budgets have been hard, but they have made it possible for Ireland to exit the bailout programme, move the economy and society into a real recovery and to get our country to a point where we are reducing the amount of debt and the need for us to borrow year after year.<\/p>  <p>  The overwhelming priority of this year&rsquo;s budget, which is ambitious but is also sensible, is to sustain the recovery and keep things going in such a way that more communities and people across the country can participate in it and benefit from it.  That is the reason for the introduction of measures such as the reduction in the universal social charge, investment in important public services such as the employment of more nurses and doctors and more staff in classrooms.  One important measure in particular that was taken yesterday was to provide further support for one of the backbones of the economy, namely, the self employed.  All of the measures are sensible, affordable and will sustain the recovery that is under way and give more people the ability and opportunity to benefit from it.<\/p>  <p>  Just as was the case with the recent capital plan published by my Department, the budget contained many measures people supported but there were many more things absent from it that people wanted.  The Government was not in a position to meet all expectations.  The reason for that is we can only spend the money we have at the moment or the money we sensibly expect to have in the future.  We cannot spend money that we do not or will not have.  If we do so, we will end up in the kind of difficulty we are all working to get away from.  It is clear that we can only spend in line with our capacity to pay for the spending.  I am still conscious that while our borrowing requirements are reducing, we are still borrowing.  That is the reason the Government's target to balance our books by 2018 is such an important objective.<\/p>  <p>  My Department seeks to make a further contribution to the positive change under way in the country.  The budget for 2016 will allow for a total expenditure by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of &euro;1.74 billion.  That is an increase of 8%, or &euro;125 million on 2015.  It marks the first year the allocation for capital spending for my Department has exceeded &euro;1 billion.  That is important progress as it allows us to make more of a contribution to the maintenance of existing roads and railways while beginning work on the kind of projects we know are vital to sustain future recovery.<\/p><p>There will be an increase of &euro;47 million in current funding to bring the total current spend to just under &euro;722 million.  This increase in funding includes an additional &euro;28 million or a 14% increase in public service obligation, PSO, subvention.  This is being provided to support increased and improved public transport services, including those operated under the rural transport programme.  The priorities for this funding will be to reduce congestion by responding to passenger demand on key Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann services, the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel next summer and improving the services currently available on the DART.  As a result of this extra funding the National Transport Authority, NTA, will now finalise its plans for 2016.  An additional &euro;2 million will be provided to support co-operative overseas marketing to support important initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and the work pertaining to the Rugby World Cup 2023 bid.  An additional &euro;3 million also will be made available to support important sporting and physical activity initiatives, such as the new national physical activity action plan, and to help the sporting bodies and national governing bodies, NGBs, of sport to continue in their important work in preparing for the Olympic and Paralympic Games at the end of next year.<\/p> <p> As for capital expenditure, there will be an increase of &euro;78 million to provide funding for the maintenance of the existing road and rail network and to allow for an increase in capital funding to deliver the construction of the national indoor arena, which is to open by the end of 2016.  This will be an incredibly important and positive development for Irish sport in that it will provide an indoor facility in which up to 20 different disciplines will be able to participate, as well as an arena that will further allow Ireland to compete for major international sporting events that currently are being held elsewhere.<\/p> <p> On taxation, yesterday the Minister for Finance announced a &euro;43 million plan with regard to the commercial motor tax system for heavy goods vehicles.  This will reduce, and have a positive effect on, motor tax levels for 29,000 goods vehicles.  I wish to acknowledge in the Chamber that the work this sector performs for the economy is vital to its effective performance.  Earlier today, while preparing for work in respect of this sector, I was struck by how, due to the fact we have an island economy, transport costs absorb an extremely high portion of the total cost base a company must face when it is selling its goods and services abroad or when it seeks to sell its goods and services into Ireland.  Consequently, while this measure is important for the sector and is a recognition of the vital work it does to allow the economy to perform and to allow goods and services to circulate, even more importantly this measure seeks to contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the economy and to the competitiveness of manufacturing, in particular.  I look forward to continuing to work with the sector to support it in its measures to employ more people and to allow others to employ more people as a result of this measure.  Of itself, this measure is an interim one put in place pending the replacement of the current commercial motor tax regime with a fairer basis for calculating motor tax, which will be based on the design gross vehicle weight of goods vehicles and will promote more efficient and less polluting vehicles.  In addition to the importance of that measure, other plans confirmed in the capital plan also will allow the haulage sector to do its work in a more efficient way by upgrading important roads it requires, as well as investing in connectivity and access into important ports.<\/p> <p> Yesterday's budget also included a freeze in the special tourism-related VAT rate of 9%.  As with previous years, this will be subject to review to ensure that visitors to Ireland continue to benefit in terms of value for money from this lower rate.  I recognise this is an important measure that has played an important role in the creation or retention of 30,000 jobs nationwide.  However, I also emphasise this measure is conditional on not witnessing a return to the kind of pricing that caused such damage to Irish tourism in the past.  In particular, I recognise that outside Dublin and some of the larger cities, the hotel sector continues to grapple with legacy debt issues and is working hard to get back on its own feet.  It is in particular recognition of the speed of that recovery across many parts of Ireland that the Government has decided to maintain the rate at this level for next year.<\/p> <p> Turning to spending, I will outline a few important priorities.  I already have outlined the increase of &euro;28 million to support increased public transport services.  This is a significant development in the funding of public transport within Ireland.  It represents the restoration of approximately 25% of the total cuts since 2008 and comes after many years of decline.  When I took office more than a year ago, I indicated that an important priority for me was to stabilise the level of PSO funding and to ensure it was not cut further.  I did so in recognition of the fact that for the first time in a number of years, the number of journeys on the public transport network increased after many years of decline.  If one considers the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann alone, last year that company carried almost 1 million additional passengers.  It now is important to begin the work to invest further to allow more services to be provided.  However, I emphasise this cannot be at the expense of losing the efficiency gains generated by the public transport companies because such further investment should have a tangible and noticeable effect for commuters who need better trains and a more reliable service and who, in many cases, experience bus services that do not meet their needs.  This is why I am making this investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400026#Y00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444828800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Is the Minister sharing time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400027#Z00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444828800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I was not aware of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400027#Z00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1444828800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is not on the list I have to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400027#Z00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444828800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I certainly can wrap up quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise one other important priority in respect of sport, which is to recognise that for 2016, there now is an overall sports allocation, in current terms alone, of &euro;47 million for Sport Ireland and that the overall sports programme allocation has been increased by 40% from last year's allocation.

It also is right that the people start to see the tangible benefits of the recovery.  It is with these twin priorities in mind that the Government has framed its budgetary choices this year.  In so doing, it remains acutely aware of the need to walk a narrow path between the benefits arising from a fledgling recovery and the danger of overplaying our hand and finding ourselves back in troubled waters.<\/p><p>The 2016 Estimate for my Department once again demonstrates that this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reform and service developments to support Ireland's children and families.  I remain fully committed to ensuring real reform of child welfare and protection services and making this country a better and safer place to be a child or young person.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to announce the allocation of significant additional funding for children and young people's services under budget 2016.  The gross amount of funding for my Department in 2016 will be &euro;1.137 billion, which is an increase of &euro;117.4 million, or 11.4%, over the allocation for 2015.  There are two major elements to the additional resources in my Department's Vote for 2016, including an &euro;85 million package of investment in child care and substantially increased resources for Tusla to place it on a firm financial footing and enable it to meet its obligations to children.<br\/><br\/>The first step child care package announced in the budget is a significant step towards more affordable, accessible and higher quality child care in Ireland.  It is based closely on the approach proposed in the interdepartmental group report which I published in July.  Affordability, accessibility and quality are the holy trinity of good child care provision, and each are at the heart of this &euro;85 million child care package.  The suite of measures included in this package are in line with the recommendations of the interdepartmental group on future investment in child care, informed by research and evidence of best practice and reflect the general view of key stakeholders, including parents and child care providers.  The measures provided include an expansion of free preschool provision by extension of the age range for children accessing the scheme.  The maximum number of weeks of free preschool education to which a child will be entitled will increase.  The precise period of this extension will vary for each child depending on his or her month of birth and the age at which he or she makes the transition to primary school.  For example, a January born child who starts primary school at four years of age will be entitled to up to 50 weeks of free preschool provision.  If this child starts primary school at five years of age, he or she will be entitled to up to 88 weeks provision.  It is estimated that on average children will avail of up to 23 additional weeks of free preschool provision under this budget measure.<br\/><br\/>This measure will not only support better outcomes for children by extending the duration of preschool education and encouraging later school starts but it also makes an important contribution to reducing child care costs for parents.  This extended free preschool provision will increase current investment of &euro;172.4 million in the ECCE programme by &euro;47 million in 2016.  These costs include full restoration to capitation payments to providers to pre-2012 levels from September 2016.  The child care package also provides greater guarantees that free preschool provision can be accessed by all.<br\/><br\/>Prior to budget 2016 various practical efforts were made to support children with a disability in accessing the ECCE programme.  These include more flexible rules regarding access to the free preschool year; the provision on a limited <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis by the HSE of funding towards the cost of preschool support assistants in some areas; elective modules on special needs in mandatory courses for early years practitioners; and various initiatives by city and county child care committees.  Despite these efforts, it is accepted that ECCE supports for children with a disability could be further improved.  Under budget 2016, a suite of supports to help children with a disability to participate fully in, and reap the benefits of, preschool education under the ECCE programme are being introduced.  These include a number of universal supports for all children with a disability, including funding towards the ongoing professional development of early years practitioners and a number of more targeted supports such as grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations and access to therapeutic intervention for children with complex needs arising from a disability.  These supports, which will be phased in from next year, will cost &euro;15 million in 2016.  Full year cost from 2017 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;33 million.<br\/><br\/>The package also provides for additional community child care subvention, CCS, programme places and a move towards consolidating all targeted child care support programmes.  The CCS programme traditionally provided funding to community child care services to enable them to provide quality child care at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements.  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for child care in the participating child care facility.  Prior to budget 2016, approximately 25,000 children were catered for under the CCS programme each year in almost 900 community child care services.  The programme had an annual budget of &euro;45 million.<br\/><br\/>Under budget 2016, an additional 3,200 full-time equivalent places, or up to 8,000 children based on average uptake, will be made available from early 2016.  Critically, for the first time, these places will be made available through community and, where demand exists, private child care services.  These additional CCS places will cost approximately &euro;16 million in 2016.  In addition to this, I have secured a small resource of &euro;800,000 to allow important work to commence on consolidating existing targeted child care support programmes, including the CCS programme.  It is envisaged that, in line with recommendations set out in the interdepartmental report on future investment in child care, a new simplified targeted child care support programme will be available through community and private child care providers from 2017.<br\/><br\/>After-school services have developed in a very <i>ad hoc<\/i>fashion and it is acknowledged that a more standardised approach suitable for school-going children is necessary.  Parents working full-time need the confidence that there is a reliable, quality and affordable place for their children after school.  This child care package includes funding to administer a programme of capital grants, undertake research with children on after-school child care, which is critically important, and develop quality standards for after-school child care.  It is vitally important that we continue to work in partnership with the child care sector to constantly enhance the quality of child care provision.  Deliverance of the child care reforms proposed will require a programme of concerted action and investment over a number of years.  The investment required is considerable.  The OECD reports that Ireland's investment in this area currently represents 0.5% of GDP.  This compares to an average across the OECD of 0.8% and UNICEF's international benchmark of 1% of GDP.  Based on current GDP, every 0.1% increase in public expenditure on child care requires additional investment of over &euro;180 million.  The measures announced in this budget alone will increase public expenditure on child care by almost 0.1% of GDP.  This is a solid start and a direction of travel I think most Deputies would agree is appropriate.<br\/><br\/>I have been able to increase the allocation to Tusla by &euro;38 million to allow it address unallocated cases in respect of children in need of a social worker.  A further &euro;27 million is being provided by way of Supplementary Estimate to allow Tusla clear the decks in terms of legacy issues and over-runs from this year.  Funding is also being provided for a national out-of-hours social service to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a dedicated intervention team for urgent situations and improvements to Tusla's organisational structure.<br\/><br\/>I am also pleased that we are providing an additional &euro;1.1 million in current funding and an additional &euro;2.250 million in capital funding for youth organisations.  This additional funding will support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people.  Youth work programmes and services are delivered to some 380,000 young people by 30 national youth organisations and other local youth services supported by 40,000 volunteers in communities throughout the country.  On my behalf and on behalf of the Government, I thank those organisations and, in particular, the volunteers without whom we could not achieve and progress our goals.  <br\/><br\/>Additional funding of &euro;1.6 million is also being provided to the Irish Youth Justice Services in respect of the running costs of the new national children's detention facility in Oberstown.  This funding will also support a bail support scheme designed to provide therapy services in the community to assist children in adhering to bail conditions.  The overall objective of this scheme is to reduce demand for detention school places where possible and minimise as far as possible the remand of children in custody.  Additional resources are also being provided for the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  <br\/><br\/>There is no doubt but that 2016 will be another busy year for my Department and its agencies.  I believe that the significant additional resources I have secured for 2016 will allow us to build on the hard work and effort by all involved in working with children and families, both State and voluntary organisations, to deliver on this Government's commitment to reform fundamentally the delivery of child and family services and secure better outcomes and brighter futures for our children. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400027#Z01100","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444830000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I will not take from the fact that this budget has spread funding across various Departments and agencies and there will be a benefit from that throughout the country in the context of the manner in which the Government has approached the budget.<\/p><p>I take the opportunity while the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is in the Chamber, to raise with him the issue of the child care package.  I draw his attention to a submission that was made to him from a group in Carlow on the issue of commercial rates to be paid by the private operators.  They are extremely concerned about it and find the rate burden very difficult to meet and they believe an effort should be made by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to reduce that burden.  Those operators are providing a direct service to the Minister's Department.  They are fully reliant on any funding they get from the Department and they could be classified as an educational establishment rather than what they are, and that would assist them.<\/p><p>I respect the job the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who has just contributed, is doing and I acknowledge what has been done for the transport sector with which I am familiar.  The initiative the Minister has taken in regard to road tax is significant for that sector directly and it will also have an impact on those who use the sector extensively.  It will improve the cost base for hauliers who travel from here to the UK and to Europe to service our export market, which is essential to ensure an upturn in the economy.<\/p><p>I wish to return to what was said at the time of the 2011 election.  At that time we had come forward from a period where old tribalisms were well established in politics and there was a need for a shift in how we did our political business, accounted for ourselves in this House and the way the system accounted for itself in terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General and so on.  Reforms were absolutely necessary.  The Government parties have fallen way short of the mark with respect to the promises made by the then Government parties to the electorate, the reform package they put to it and their discussion about a democratic revolution.  The Government parties have disappointed a great number of people throughout Ireland in that they have not used the large numbers they have in terms of Government support to bring about the reforms that are absolutely necessary.  I saw the need for those reforms in politics.  I have been a Member since 1997 and those reforms are still needed in the context of how we do our business in this House and how politics is managed generally.  The way we are perceived outside this House requires a great deal of attention because that results in the reform-driven agenda that is so necessary in the context of managing budget figures and auditing those figures over the years.<\/p><p>This budget is a nickel and dime approach to a whole sector of Departments and agencies.  The only real big message that came out of it was the road tax agenda of the Minister, Deputy O'Donohoe, and the effect it will have on the haulage industry.  The rest of what is in it is spread too thinly across society and the sectors within it to have any real impact.  The changes that were necessary in terms of the reform I mentioned did not come about.  As a result of that, we have the same type of budget process, we have the same tribalism within the political parties that existed in this House and we have the same approach to protecting the <i>status quo<\/i>.  That nickel and dime approach will not buy the next election for the Government parties.  Members of the public are of the same mind as they were in 2011 in regard to change and reform.  They want their lives to be considered in this House.  They want to know that the problems they face are concerns of ours and they want to know that we understand those concerns.<\/p><p>There is very little in terms of social welfare provision for people who are on that level of income.  I will cite an example given to me by Michael, a man from Kilkenny.  He left me a note at my constituency clinic last Saturday.  He states that his household benefit was thrashed, six weeks of fuel allowance is gone, 100 units of ESB have been cut and there has been a cut in his fuel allowance, from &euro;23 down to &euro;20.  He has his household charge, his septic tank charge and his property tax.  He has to pay his car tax and his petrol costs have risen.  He has to pay &euro;280 to a school for his child starting there without any regard to the cost of a uniform, shoes or anything else.  He has suffered a cut in the back to the school allowance and a cut in his child benefit, although I know that will be increased marginally in this budget.  He is getting &euro;29 a week to look after a 13 year old girl and he is on a contributory pension.  He also has all of the usual household bills, be it refuse, heating in term of gas or coal, or lighting.  He has to pay &euro;350 for the bus to take his child to school and he has home insurance of &euro;310.  The increase he will experience after this budget is nothing in the context of the real figures that he has to deliver on in terms of his household income and the draw on that income which is substantial.  His quality of life and that of his family will not be improved by this budget.  That is a tangible example of spreading provision too thinly across all various sectors.  This man's boat has not risen.<\/p><p>Another issue I have with the budget is with respect to the provision for entrepreneurs, of which great play was made.  I will define that group.  The entrepreneurs to whom I refer are the men, women and families in this country who have created 750,000 to 800,000 jobs and have sustained themselves through thick and thin in this economic downturn.  The entrepreneurs who are still in business are anxious to participate in the creation of jobs.  They want to be successful in their businesses.  The biggest single drawback for them is the Government's attitude towards the small and medium enterprise sector.  What the Minister has done in terms of examining the tax with respect to an employer versus an employee is marginal.  It is nothing.  It acknowledges their position, after years of turning a blind eye to it, but it does not help them in the course of this recession.<\/p><p>I will relay what a man texted to me about the budget yesterday.  I agree with the minimum wage, with improving people's lives and with helping people but Government intervention can often negatively distort what is happening in a small business and most small businesses today, the ones that are successful, the ones that have come through the difficulties and that are still with us, have bank debt, legacy debt and, presumably, a small debt to tide them over and keep them competitive and active in the marketplace.  That man texted that the Minister's 50 cent per hour increase in the minimum wage adds &euro;15,600 to his wage bill at a time when he cannot afford it.  He stated that he sometimes takes home less than what his employees take home.  He added that costs in the insurance industry are so out of control that this year alone added to his expense is &euro;6,000 for insurances for his business.  That is what is happening on the ground.  The Government has failed in any significant way to address that.  Small businesses on high streets throughout the country are under pressure and closing and nothing was offered to them by the Government.  I noticed in the comment that was made about consultation that not one word was said about commercial rates.  The commercial rate is the most unfair tax that could be levied on a small business.  It is talked about most times in budgets.  It is talked about inside and outside this House, but we have not given the political leadership that is necessary to reduce those rates and to bring in an ability-to-pay clause or and an ability-to-pay-on-profit clause.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400029#BB00100","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1444830000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>The Deputy should get his party's councillors to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400029#BB00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1444830000,"counter":362,"content":"<p>That is not good enough.

Of these, 90% will be in Dublin with 400 units for the rest of the country.  Kilkenny alone has 3,500 people on its housing waiting list.  These figures are massaged because those on the housing assistance payment and other schemes are considered to be adequately housed and, therefore, not on the housing list.  No account is taken of those in hotels or sleeping on our streets.  Every county has that problem.  The Minister, however, decides that 90% of the houses NAMA will provide will be located in Dublin.<\/p> <p> NAMA offered 6,569 housing units but only 2,500 units were taken up from that offer.  What is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, doing about this?  A significant number of small builders who, if given the proper opportunity with the support of each and every local authority, would help to deliver houses on the ground.

It will take a strong intervention from the Government to make those banks come to heel.  They are not assisting those families in question and have no respect for them or the Government.  As soon as the bottom-lines of those banks become better off they will ignore the Government and the citizen and get back on to the same game they were on before.  Where then will stand the Government's 2011 democratic revolution where the people were front and centre to everything?<\/p>  <p>  Another issue this budget never touched was the health service.  I asked the Taoiseach a question about hospital waiting lists but the Ceann Comhairle suggested I put down a parliamentary question on it.  I will ask it now.  I have the case of a person on a waiting list for a procedure at Waterford Regional Hospital who was then sent to Cappagh hospital.  That hospital could not deal with the procedure, so the patient was then to be sent to Altnagelvin Area Hospital.  To this day, it is hard to find out the patient&rsquo;s position on this waiting list.  That is unforgivable of any government.  These people are waiting in pain to get their procedures or operations carried out.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has allocated &euro;13.5 billion to the health services.  I suggested to the HSE chief executive officer, Mr. Tony O'Brien, that he was not up to the job and maybe the Minister should get somebody else.  He accused me of making a political statement.  It was not.  It was an honest-to-God statement regarding the fear and frustration I have for the management of the health services which I believe is out of control.  Middle to senior management in the health services has no real direction.  The system is held together by the nurses and doctors, the Band-Aid of the system, who work tirelessly day and night to keep it together.  They will not see much from this budget but the senior management and upwards will.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, the Comptroller and Auditor General had to tell the health services that they owed small businesses &euro;9 million in compensation because they did not pay them in time.  The health services tried to wriggle their way out of that.  In 2013, 2014 and again this year, the Comptroller and Auditor General has had to draw attention to the fact that the procurement rules are, by and large, ignored by the HSE and that there are issues for it to address.  There was a further issue with the settlement of tax, which involves some &euro;4 million.  Compliance performance with procurement rules is in significant difficulty.  Hospital managers have failed to get consultants to sign off on operations, so they can claim for them from private health insurance.  Those outstanding claims come to &euro;290 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na noted its failure to comply with computer procurement rules.  The report highlighted taxpayers&rsquo; money was not applied to the projects for which it was intended, some &euro;691,000, in Vote 25, community and local government.  The postal code system was originally meant to cost &euro;18 million but will now cost &euro;38 million.  The Revenue Commissioners have said they will not use it.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General do not audit the significant moneys that go to the local government system.  Will the Government bring forward the necessary appropriate reforms to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out his duties to audit local government?  Will the Government give him the powers, and indeed the funding, to ensure that forensic examinations can be undertaken of the expenditure of this Government or any government?  This is not a political point but about the administration of the State, which is failing this Government and the taxpayers, who contribute &euro;50 billion a year in taxes.  We are not getting value for money.  It is simple.  Will the Government amalgamate the local government audit system and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, give them all the appropriate powers they need to conduct their inquiries across Government agencies and Departments, fund them properly and ensure they follow the taxpayers&rsquo; money to the point at which it is spent?  That is all I am asking for.  It is not for me.  It is for the Government and for the proper management of the State to ensure we can get some closure on the inefficiencies and failures of the State.  If those failures were corrected, it would force the Government to collect more taxes than what it might need.<\/p>  <p>  What is wrong with that?  The former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, suggested many of these actions when he was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first action I took when I entered the House was to introduce a Bill that might enable that to happen.  The Government, however, refused to support it.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  When he was Chairman, every week he would lead the committee to the audio-visual room to give a press conference on the extreme waste and inefficiencies in the system.  These are, however, still going on.  I am a taxpayer and used to be a small business person.  They look aghast at the fact that we do not address these issues.  It might make the Government&rsquo;s budget figures a lot easier but that does not happen.  Will the Government consider bringing forward legislative proposals to ensure these changes take place?<\/p>  <p>  There are many examples and these are but a few.  It is simple to capture them in an independent way.  The Minister should look into the marine section in his Department at leases which were never signed, moneys never collected and the way people were treated.  It tells its own story.<\/p><p>Finally, there are times when the State wrongs an individual and instead of owning up to it, it will head for the <i>status quo<\/i>and the safety and comfort of hiding behind the system.  The devastation that attitude has brought to individual people and families in the country is nothing short of shocking and a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400030#CC00300","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444831200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Is the Minister, Deputy Coveney, sharing time or will he be taking the 20 minutes for himself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400031#DD00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444831200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I will be sharing the time with myself because I have two portfolios I wish to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400031#DD00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1444831200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I wanted to check because a previous Minister was unaware he could share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400031#DD00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444831200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am okay, unless the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, is due to speak.  I will take on board some of the issues raised by Deputy McGuinness although I do take issue with some of the generalised comments on the marine element of my portfolios.  The complexity of leasing arrangements in some of our fisheries harbours are not as straightforward as Deputy McGuinness makes out and some of the people who are asking for leases to be signed have issues they need to deal with in respect of those harbours.  However, I take the point in general and some of the points are fair.<\/p><p>As a Government and as a country, we have dealt with a number of difficult budgets.  The difficult decisions taken during that time have made it possible for Ireland to exit a bailout, reduce debt levels and move towards real recovery.  During that time, the agrifood sector has continued to prove its fundamental importance as a cornerstone of the economy and rural life in general.  I am pleased to say that the 2016 budget reflects a significant Exchequer recognition of that position and demonstrates a further commitment of support for the agrifood sector as a whole.  The Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1.351 billion in 2016, which is &euro;1.134 billion in current expenditure and &euro;217 million in capital expenditure.  This represents an overall increase of &euro;109 million over this year&rsquo;s Estimate and takes account of new priorities including, in particular, the rural development programme and the seafood development programme.  The agrifood sector  continues to play a significant role in our economic recovery, accounting for in excess of 169,000 jobs, and total agrifood exports amount to just under &euro;11.3 billion as of last year, which is an increase of 29% since 2010. <\/p><p>In addition to the Department's Vote, in 2016 Ireland will receive some &euro;1.2 billion in direct funding from the EU for our basic payment scheme.  I am pleased to announce that advance payments of 70% will be issued to farmers next week, which is the equivalent of about &euro;750 million.  I welcome the taxation measures introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, which demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the agrifood sector.  Last year we successfully collaborated on an agritaxation review, the most substantial package of its kind ever introduced in a single budget and worth about &euro;300 million to farmers.  <\/p><p>Additional measures have been announced in budget 2016, including a major new initiative on family transfer partnerships to assist succession, which I will deal with later, the removal of forestry income from the high earners restriction for active foresters and farmers and, of course, the inclusion of farmers under the self-employed tax credit of &euro;550 announced yesterday.<\/p><p>In order to build on the progress achieved in recent years, the following measures have been prioritised for funding over the coming year.  The rural development programme will see an investment of &euro;4 billion in agriculture between the years 2014 to 2020 and is a key support in rural areas.The rural development programme schemes provide vital investment capital in the rural economy, prioritise agri-environmental protection and support the incomes of family farms.  Overall, for 2016 I have secured almost &euro;500 million for investment in the rural development programme, which is up from &euro;439 million in 2015 and an increase of over 12.5%. <\/p><p>In terms of the agri-environment scheme, which is the biggest of these schemes, &euro;203 million will be made available for the agri-environmental schemes AEOS, GLAS and Organics.  At least 35,000, and up to 40,000, farmers will benefit under the new green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, known to farmers as GLAS, which encourages farmers to farm in an environmentally sustainable manner and pays them for specific actions they will take.  Of course, this scheme will ultimately support up to 50,000 farmers and require funding of &euro;250 million per annum in future years.  However, we are getting there faster than had been promised and predicted. <\/p><p>I am allocating &euro;195 million to areas of natural constraint, continuing strong support for farmers farming in disadvantaged areas, and this will continue to generate an important multiplier effect in these local economies.  I have also allocated funding amounting to almost &euro;36 million to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, for 2016.  This will provide funding for<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>the young farmer capital investment scheme as well as dairy equipment, organic capital investments, sheep fencing, pig and poultry investments, the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme and the low emission slurry spreading scheme.  All of these are strategic schemes which seek to change and modernise farming through innovation and better ways of doing things.<\/p><p>I am also seeking approval from Cabinet for a scheme to specifically target the tillage sector with support for appropriate investments and I will also reintroduce support for sheep fencing.  The beef data and genomics scheme is a big area under the rural development programme.  This innovative scheme is now almost fully subscribed with 29,000 applicants and will be further resourced to the tune of &euro;52 million in 2016. <\/p><p>In terms of the marine and seafood area, in anticipation of the approval of the seafood development programme I am providing some &euro;36 million to my Department, the Marine Institute and BIM to fund the roll-out of capital investment schemes.  In 2016, this is expected to include the launch of a new capital investment scheme, including supports for the discards ban, aquaculture development, seafood processing, fisheries local action groups, decommissioning of vessels innovation, new product development in the processing sector, stock conservation and sustainability in the inshore fisheries sector and training and advisory services for fishermen and aquaculture enterprises.  In addition, significant investments will be made in enhancing control and enforcement of the common fisheries policy.  <\/p><p>It is worth noting that the seafood development programme that is going to be rolled out in the next five years is more than twice the size of the value of the fund of any previous seafood development programme introduced in Ireland.  I also welcome the publication of the marine taxation review, which recommends potential areas for support through the taxation system and I look forward to further engagement on the specific recommendations.  It is hoped that those recommendations will be factored into the finance Bill in the days to come.  <\/p><p>Food Wise 2025 emphasises the need to attract new talent to the sector and increase land mobility to ensure the productive use of land.  In negotiating the last CAP reform, I was concerned to provide additional support for young trained farmers.  These priorities were reflected in the new tax measures last year.  We can already see these changes are driving real structural change in Irish agriculture right now.  We have more young farmers in agricultural colleges than we have ever had before and we need to ensure they are not disappointed when they go back home to farm with a view to taking ownership and control of the management of their enterprises.  <\/p><p>Four existing tax measures on stock relief and stamp duty relief which are vitally important to young farmers and partnerships, in particular, have been renewed for a further three years.  These measures are the 25% general stock relief on income tax, the 100% stock relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers, the 50% stock relief on income tax for registered farm partnerships and the stamp duty exemption on transfers of land to young trained farmers.  The retention of the valuable 90% agricultural relief on capital acquisitions tax is also essential to facilitate inter-generational farm transfers.  <\/p><p>The area that is getting the most headlines today from an agricultural point of view is the new family transfer partnership introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, yesterday.  I am particularly pleased with the development.  This incentive will encourage important conversations within farm families about succession planning at an earlier stage and will facilitate earlier inter-generational transfer of family farms.  There is a significant tax credit of up to &euro;5,000 a year for five years to encourage them in this regard.  That is &euro;25,000 to incentivise the orderly and managed transfer of the family farm from one generation to the next, which is what we are trying to achieve.<\/p><p>On environmental sustainability, almost &euro;114 million will be made available under the forestry programme in 2016.  The removal of forestry income from the high earners restriction for active foresters and farmers<b><\/b>is a significant measure in support of national forestry policy.  This is something for which the forestry sector has been campaigning for the last three years and we are delivering more than it was seeking.  What was being sought was income averaging over a certain number of years.  Instead, we have decided to exempt income in its entirety.  That will allow much more efficient and commercial afforestation and clear felling in Ireland, which makes a great deal of sense for a sector that has tight margins and is very competitive.<br\/><br\/>In terms of research and development, I am fully committed to research and innovation which drive competitiveness, profitability and sustainable economic growth.  I am continuing to prioritise innovation by allocating over &euro;31 million for research, development and training to be delivered mainly through the Department&rsquo;s competitive food institutional research measure, FIRM, stimulus and forestry research funding programmes and Teagasc training.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to announce an increase of &euro;6 million in the 2016 allocation for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This is an increase of<b><\/b>almost 9% and brings the total fund to &euro;74 million.  It is almost back to the level it was at during the boom.  This is a sector with a turnover of approximately &euro;1.2 billion and which employs approximately 17,000 people; therefore, it will give a great deal more back than we are putting into it.  The Government's commitment to the racing and greyhound industries has been extraordinary in recent years, given the financial pressures we have endured.  I hope the increase will be welcomed and put to good use.<br\/><br\/>I continue to be very concerned about farm safety.  The number of fatalities in the farming sector is unacceptable.  Last year the figures were horrific and many families are still in mourning as a result.  This year the numbers are not quite as high, but they are still far too high.  We have again prioritised farm safety as a critical component of the TAMS and I have also made it a mandatory requirement for all applicants to have completed a minimum of a half day farm safety course before they can claim grant-in-aid in any of the new schemes we are opening.<br\/><br\/>Animal welfare is an issue on which I am anxious to have made a definite change by the time I leave office.  I feel very strongly about animal welfare.  I am, therefore, pleased to be in a position to provide some additional funding in this area.  I will increase funding by &euro;600,000 in 2016 to &euro;2.7 million to support animal welfare organisations.  Five years ago the figure was a fraction of this.  My Department has a responsibility for welfare issues and we are delivering from a funding perspective.  I am maintaining the funding of &euro;2.8 million to assist local authorities in reducing instances of horse abandonment and advancing horse projects for urban and Traveller horse owners.  We are anxious to build specific horse welfare projects in and around some of our towns and cities and are providing capital funding to do this.<br\/><br\/>This has been a good budget for farmers, as it should be.  Agriculture, farmers and the food industry are the most important parts of Ireland's indigenous economy.  They must be supported by the Government and are being supported by it.  That will continue.<br\/><br\/>My other responsibility is the Department of Defence.  I am pleased to be able to signal an increase in the defence 2016 allocation to allow the first step towards the implementation of the recently published White Paper on defence and continue the Defence Forces' delivery of operational outputs, both at home and overseas.  This is the first increase in the defence budget since 2008.  Although some opposition parties would like us to reduce defence expenditure, I do not agree with that position.  Our troops, sailors and members of the Air Corps need modern equipment to be safe and do an efficient and safe job, both at home and abroad in their peacekeeping role.<br\/><br\/>The combined defence 2016 allocation of some &euro;904 million, comprising &euro;224 million for Vote 35 for Army pensions and &euro;680 million for Vote 36, is a significant level of funding and shows an increase of &euro;6 million on the corresponding 2015 allocation.  The White Paper on defence sets out the roles the Government has assigned to the Defence Forces and looks at associated capability requirements.  It sets out proposals on the replacement of major equipment platforms for the next decade and other priorities for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The White Paper has a crucial role to play in determining our financial strategies and spending plans in the next decade.  The improving public finances will allow further scope for investment in the replacement of major equipment and ongoing recruitment.<br\/><br\/>It is in this context that I have made a commitment to maintaining Permanent Defence Force, PDF, numbers at 9,500.  The Permanent Defence Force is conducting a very active recruitment campaign to ensure we stay at that number.  In parallel with the ongoing recruitment campaign, I am pleased to announce that there have been over 500 promotions across all ranks of the Permanent Defence Force to date in 2015.  The White Paper on defence also outlined a range of measures that would be progressed during the next few years to develop further the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, which plays an important strategic role and will do so in the future.<br\/><br\/>Capital expenditure accounts for a sizeable element of the defence Vote and the increased allocation for defence under the recently announced 2016-21 capital investment programme is highly significant.  In total, &euro;437 million is provided for defence capital investment over that period and this allocation will be expended on replacement programmes for defensive equipment across the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service, as well as on an infrastructure works programme within barracks.  The naval vessel replacement programme has seen the <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>added to the Naval Service fleet in 2015, joining the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>which was delivered in April 2014.  A third ship purchased under this programme, the future <i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>, is scheduled for delivery in July 2016.  The progressive and prudent approach taken to these purchases is testament to the value for money ethos prevailing within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.<br\/><br\/>The capital funding envelope provides for the development of a key proposal under the White Paper, the new institute for peace support and leadership training, building on the UN Training School in the Curragh.  The institute is intended to provide a new international resource in the area of conflict resolution, conflict prevention and peace building.  The capital allocation will also provide for the ongoing refurbishment of a diverse defence property portfolio and the provision of replacement or additional facilities, where required.  I will provide more details on the peace and leadership institute in the weeks ahead.<br\/><br\/>I take the opportunity to pay tribute to Defence Forces personnel serving overseas in very important and often challenging situations.  Ireland is contributing 494 Defence Forces personnel to 12 overseas missions.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to international peace and security.  The numbers will increase.  We are committed to providing at least another 170 personnel for UNIFIL next year.  In addition, there will possibly be another 175 committed in connection with the German battle group, should it be called upon for a peacekeeping mission somewhere in the world.  Our role overseas is one that makes Irish people very proud.  It is also really testing for the Defence Forces.  It is what they train for and what they do, but it is a significant and sometimes very dangerous job, be it in southern Lebanon, on the Golan Heights, in north Africa, eastern Europe, Afghanistan or in the Mediterranean where our sailors, with the support of some of our soldiers and medical staff, have saved almost 8,000 people during the summer months.<br\/><br\/>Domestic security remains primarily the role of the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the Defence Forces will continue to provide essential support for the civil power throughout 2016, whenever requested to do so.  I take the opportunity to express my deep condolences to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the families who are mourning as a result of the tragedies that have occurred in recent days.<\/p><p>Following a Government decision to establish the emergency aeromedical support service on a permanent basis, I am pleased to announce that an additional allocation of &euro;2.2 million was provided in the defence Vote for reimbursement of Air Corps costs incurred in the provision of this service.  This is now a permanent service, in partnership with the HSE and the Department of Health.<\/p> <p> With the onset of winter, it is important to also highlight the assistance provided by the Defence Forces for the civil authorities.  Apart from weather emergency responses, the Defence Forces have the training, equipment, skills and expertise to assist the civil authorities to deal with a range of diverse events, ranging from fire fighting, maritime patrols, air ambulance duties to missing person searches.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the vital contribution Civil Defence volunteers make to the State.  The Department of Defence provides support for local Civil Defence units, including central training, as well as supplying vehicles, boats, uniforms and personal protective equipment for volunteers.<\/p> <p> The Defence Forces as a whole are opening a new chapter in their development and modernisation and the asks being made of them by the Government, to which they will have to respond.  We now have a White Paper that charts a very exciting future in which the Government will give strong support through a clear policy and appropriate levels of funding.  The Defence Forces will respond in the way they respond to every challenge - by delivering on the asks made of them by the State.

If I am to be honest, it did not make for great reading.  The group referred to the budget as a &quot;let down for poor one-parent families&quot;.  Contained within the letter was the following:<\/p><blockquote>...this government has heaped cuts on those one-parent families who rely on social welfare in the past four budgets.  Child poverty rates have rocketed.  [I]f Government really wants to be family-friendly to all families then more needs to be done to be aware of the reality of the diversity of families in Ireland and what they need.<\/blockquote><p>The budget, when looked at proportionately, will do very little to protect and fails the most vulnerable.  For the Government, there seems to be a disconnect when it comes to a realisation of the realities.  It had the opportunity yesterday to make the lives of vulnerable people more secure, yet it introduced another budget that, once again, favoured those most well-off in our society.<\/p><p>I welcome the additional allocation being made available to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, as it was an issue I brought up just last week.  However, I repeat what I said then.  Serious investment is required in the social work sector to allow ratios to be brought down to more workable levels in the hope of producing a more efficient service and allowing those children most at risk to be protected in so far as is humanly possible.  Family resource centres also require adequate investment, at both national and local level, to facilitate their work, given the ever-rising number of vulnerable children and families presenting to their services.  Prevention is better than emergency firefighting.<\/p><p>Some 1,496 children are still living in emergency accommodation and judging by trends in the housing sector and ever-increasing rents in the private sector, this number will continue to rise.  Yesterday the Government could have attempted to tackle this crisis but instead decided against it.  The introduction of rent caps in the private sector would give struggling families some sense of security, but this opportunity was ignored.  It could also have looked at the possibility of increasing rent supplement limits.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>just last week it was highlighted that over 90% of available properties were out of reach of someone who received rent allowance.  Does the Government fail to hear the voices of those who need help most or does it deliberately turn a deaf ear?  When looked at objectively, one can only derive that, with thousands of people in need of rent support and less accommodation available, this will result in more people being subjected to homelessness and becoming part of a crisis that has already reached astronomical levels.  All it requires is a basic analysis and the application of a minimal amount of logic, but, not surprisingly, this has evaded the Government yet again.<\/p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said yesterday that child care was a key priority for the Government.  He said the increased allocation would allow him to bring forward a package of measures to ease the burden on working families.  I welcome the extension of the free preschool year, but what about those children ranging from zero to three years of age?  There is very little in the budget that will be of benefit to them.  It is virtually impossible to expect someone to go back to work on a full-time basis when so much of their wages would be spent on child care.  Take, for example, a family on the minimum wage and lucky enough to be given full-time hours.  They must seek child care, which would account for a huge proportion of their income.  The Government speaks about getting people to return to employment, but the policies it implements make this very difficult.  The additional funding allocated to the ECCE programme is welcome, but it is still a far cry from the 0.8% of GDP which is the average figure across OECD countries.<\/p><p>It is welcome that Sinn F&eacute;in's lead on the introduction of two weeks paternity leave was followed by the Government, although it is very unfortunate that it does not plan to implement this legislation until September 2016.  It seems to be based on the premise that the coalition will still be in power this time next year, about which I would not be so sure.  We had suggested there was space to go further and extend maternity leave, allowing for another six weeks to be afforded to either parent, but, unfortunately, this was not taken on board.  If the Government is really committed to child care and the aspiration to follow a Scandinavian model, it needs to address the gaping holes and the many questions that arise from the double-speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400033#FF00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1444832400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>There is precious little for struggling farmers in the budget.  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, has repeatedly called for the restoration of the farm assist payments to their 2013 level.  The Government's refusal to respond to that call which is echoed by farming organisations shows a disconnect from the realities of life for those who are struggling in rural Ireland.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton's claim that farm assist could be replaced by jobseeker's allowance shows how little she and the Government care if they end up destroying rural life as we know and cherish it.<\/p>  <p>  There is a definite trend in all of the new measures which shows that the future of the family farm and the rural way of life, from which most of us come, are not a concern for this or the past Government.  This is despite all of the promises and spin in which the Government has been engaged for the past few months.  In the case of farmers, it started with the abolition last March of milk quotas.  One would think they were after winning the lotto the way this was heralded, but many small dairy farmers are now in trouble, yet the Government sits back, as the Taoiseach did this morning on the issue of homelessness, and tells us the market will resolve everything.  The banks are chasing small dairy farmers and the market price of milk is too low, but the worship of market forces and the disregard for the vulnerable, not just in farming or rural areas but all over the State, mean that in everything the Government does, including the budget, the vulnerable are on their own.<\/p>  <p>  Has nothing been learned from what happened in phe last few years?  Is the Government so insulated from the real world that a return to boom and bust politics is acceptable?  It is trumpeting the fact that it has made taxation changes to help the less well-off when it is clear from the figures that the cuts to the universal social charge and the changes to PRSI will put triple the amount in the pocket of someone on &euro;70,000 per year compared to the average worker.  The person earning &euro;70,000 will benefit to the tune of &euro;886 per year, while a person on &euro;25,000 will receive less than &euro;230 per year.<\/p>  <p>  The way the Government is handing out lollipops might win it a few votes in the general election, but it is damaging the tax base in the long term.  Reducing taxation income in such a way can only mean more damage to public services in the future and the Government is doing this in a totally dishonest way.  Saving up trouble for the future is the way boom and bust politics work, but the Government does not give a damn about the suffering this will mean down the line for the most vulnerable, as long as it can cynically pull the wool over people's eyes until the general election.  It does not even pretend that it is working towards a meaningful long-term investment in infrastructure and front-line services.<\/p><p>The media talk about the emergency in the health service and the homelessness crisis, but when the Government laid out its plans for these services yesterday, its policy was to make them do with what they had.  It has turned what those dependent on the services call a crisis into a policy of \"making do\".  We can now truly say it is the Government's policy to leave health, education and housing services in the state they are in, with the suffering that implies.<\/p> <p> The Government was crowing about NAMA building 20,000 homes in the next five years.  Even if that was enough, what has the Government been doing in the past five years since building stopped and suffering and stress for thousands of people followed?  I hope it will get its comeuppance before the anniversary of the Easter Rising as it has made a mockery of the 1916 Proclamation.  This is not the future the men and women of 1916 envisaged for the country, for which they fought and were prepared to die.  The Government has made a mockery of the aspirations for a equality of rights and opportunities for the people.  It has looked after the top 14%, giving them &euro;180 million in a reduction of the universal social charge alone, with giving relief for the lower paid.<\/p> <p> The Government has shown itself to be cynical in the extreme.  Ministers stand and talk about recovery, but it is not a fair recovery.  They look after the well heeled, but the rest can continue to suffer the consequences.  The Government has made no meaningful attempt to tackle child poverty or homelessness.  It has engineered the closure of a refuge for victims of domestic violence.  Thousands are homeless; people are dying on the streets; the health service is collapsing, and inequality is increasing on all sides.  Sinn F&eacute;in has set out a political alternative that puts investment centre stage - investment in services, infrastructure and small businesses.  All of this can be delivered through fair and sustainable taxation.  The Government calls this fantasy, while visiting a nightmare on the people we represent.  Shame on Ministers and the Government.<\/p> <p> I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and offer my sympathy on the murder of Garda Golden and the deaths of the Traveller families who died the other day.  I also offer my sympathy on the death of the homeless person who died on the streets and the death of Fr. Gear&oacute;id O'Donoghue, a priest in my parish who burned to death in a house fire on Monday morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400033#FF00400","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444833000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Traveller community.<\/p>  <p>  In my brief contribution I wish to focus on education.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party came to office in 2011 and between then and yesterday's budget announcement some &euro;500 million had been taken out of the education budget.  We saw capitation grants slashed, increased class sizes, cuts to summer works schemes and minor works grants and Traveller resources.  Overall, &euro;500 million has been taken from the budget.  Now, with the first budget that, according to the Government, gives us the opportunity to improve public services, one would think education would be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister know how much was included in the education budget yesterday?  The answer is &euro;24 million.  The Department will spin and state an extra &euro;170 million was included in the education budget.  While that is correct on paper, some &euro;154 million of it is earmarked to meet the rise in demographics and the terms of the pay agreement.  We were running to stand still in that regard.  Therefore, we have just &euro;24 million available, of which we are using &euro;18 million to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio - a welcome initiative - and &euro;6 million to implement junior cycle reform which has not yet been agreed to by one of the main trade unions.  There is no doubt, therefore, that the education sector was not a priority yesterday for the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The same goes for the health service.  Members on the Government side may shake their heads, but apart from the investment to provide for the rise in demographics, the additional spend in this area is just &euro;18 million for new initiatives.  I do not know how the Government can try to explain this.  There is no increase for young jobseekers under 25 years, although their income was cut to &euro;100.  The opportunity was not taken yesterday to increase this figure.  If we look at what the Government has done in regard to the tax base, there is no doubt that it has been completely hollowed out.  This will have a detrimental impact on future budgets.  Rather than expand the tax base in a fair and equitable manner, the Government has put &euro;180 million back into the pockets of the top 14% of wealthiest earners.  Meanwhile, a young jobseeker under 25 years who has received no increase is expected to survive on &euro;100 a week.<\/p>  <p>  The Government massaged the figures for housing.  It talks about NAMA delivering 20,000 houses, but the bulk of them are to be built in Dublin, with only 2,000 to be built in the other 25 counties.  This will not go far to address the housing crisis.  The majority of the houses that will come on line will be affordable and commercial units, not social units.  The Government talks about the local authorities and states it has provided them with money and that they should get on with addressing the issues, but it is not as simple as that.  It sat on its hands for four and a half years and cut funding to local authorities.  Therefore, they did not have the ability to plan the building of houses.  Some did not even have architects and some do not even have a plumber.  The Government cannot just wave a magic wand and state it has now provided the money and let the local authorities get on with the job.  A long-term strategy is required.<\/p>  <p>  Homelessness is on the rise.  Despite all the announcements made on housing in 2015 alone - five - we have more people homeless now than when these initiatives were announced.  Clearly, the strategies are not working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400034#GG00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1444833000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach stated this morning that the main thrust of the budget was to keep the recovery moving, yet much of the analysis of the budget shows that it will reward the small minority at the top the most.  This is the fifth budget the Government has introduced and it has followed the same trend.  The analysis of the trade union think thank, TASC, of last year's triple effect of changes to tax bands, tax rates and USC rates found that budget 2015 had given the biggest cash return, in absolute and relative terms, to those earning &euro;70,000 or over.  This budget will do the same.  It is clear that higher earners are experiencing recovery and that the Government wants to continue to reward them with more and more money, while public services that hold our society together crumble.  The budget will put &euro;181.9 million into the pockets of the top 14% of earners by way of tax cuts but spend a miserly &euro;18 million extra on health services and &euro;24 million on the resource-starved education system.<\/p>  <p>  When will the homeless have a voice in this Chamber?  When will those faced with losing their home have a sympathetic ear?  More importantly, when will they have a champion for their cause in Government Buildings?  When, if ever, will the Government wake up to the crisis facing more and more families?  How many more homeless people will have to die and how many more families will have to endure raising their children in a hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation with just a kettle?  The number of children living in homeless facilities has grown during the Government's enlightened term.  Rents and social housing lists have grown during its term.  When will it declare an emergency and address the issue of rent regulation?  The answer is perhaps never.<\/p>  <p>  The hopes and aspirations of citizens have not grown during the Government's term, but the number of citizens at risk of poverty has.  Income inequality has grown during the Government's term.  Mickey Mouse job activation schemes have grown during its term, while the idea of a fair society has been hammered under its watch.  The number of people working on low wages has grown during the Government's term, while the number of patients on trolleys has increased.  Is it any wonder that Irish citizens, especially young people, have continued to leave the State in increasing numbers since the Government began its term of office?  Over 500,000 have left since 2008.  Will this be the Government's legacy?<\/p><p> Government speakers are also hyping up the decision to extend free GP care to all children under 12.  When will the Government extend the medical card to the seriously ill or those with terminal illnesses, a topic which has been discussed many times in this House?  Ministers have focused on the announcement of 1,000 extra nurses to be hired this year, which seems welcome.  None of them seems to remember that in February, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch said 1,500 would retire from mental health services this year alone.  We are losing front-line staff in our health service and are not gaining any.<\/p> <p> Another much-heralded element of the budget was the minimum wage rise of 50 cent to &euro;9.15, but speakers failed to mention that the HSE will not pay minimum wage to fourth year student nurses, who are currently working 39-hour weeks for 9 months on &euro;6.95 a hour.  Surely this anomaly needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that overseas development assistance, ODA, has increased by &euro;40 million.  ODA must play a fundamental role in our foreign affairs and Ireland must prioritise international assistance on efforts to end poverty and inequality around the world, especially as the world is currently suffering an unprecedented number of simultaneous conflicts and humanitarian crises.  I again challenge the Government to fully document how it plans to reach the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income for aid spending as the current allocation represents just 0.36% of Ireland's current GNI.  In the interest of accountability and transparency I, along with others, have consistently asked the Government to do this and I reiterate those calls today.  I also welcome the allocation of &euro;25 million for the refugee resettlement and relocation programme.  However, we lack accurate and up-to-date information on this initiative.<\/p> <p> Overall, this budget has failed to deliver.  Sadly, the recovery is for the few, not for the many.  It is another missed opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400034#GG00300","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444833600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, are sharing time and have ten minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400035#HH00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1444833600,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Tired old cliches like \"helping the well heeled\" and \"small minority at the top\" are no substitute for analysis.

The only way to be credible is to base what one says on the facts, not to recycle speeches from last year and the year before.  Some of the speakers from Fianna F&aacute;il were doing the same.  Deputy Michael McGrath, who led for Fianna F&aacute;il yesterday, spent a great deal of his speech criticising cuts and measures that occurred in previous budgets.  Legitimate criticism, perhaps, but not relevant to this budget.  I ask colleagues opposite to read these speeches and read the materials that are put before them in the House.<\/p>  <p>  This is a prudent budget which balances the twin objectives of safeguarding the recovery and raising living standards.  By any reasonable view, that is what it sets out to do.  It will see the continued reduction of the debt and deficit, which is the borrowing the State has to undertake.  Those realities were inherited from the catastrophic policies of the previous Government.  The budget also sees us investing in the essential public services which were devastated by those policies, including education as the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan will no doubt address.  It sees us increasing the incomes of families left to pay the price of the disastrous policies of the previous Government.  The incomes and living standards of individual citizens and families will increase as a result of this budget.  That has become manifest.  There is no point in my colleagues opposite denying it if they want to be taken seriously.  <\/p>  <p>  I say it is a fair budget and I do not accept the suggestion that it is not fair.  I will come back to that in a moment.  It is a budget that unashamedly distributes the early returns of our recovery to our citizens, families and communities across all sectors.  It is a progressive budget that increases the take-home pay of middle income earners as well as those on lower incomes.  The greatest impact of the tax measures will be on people who are on average and low incomes.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  The distortion in which Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and others have sought to engage in the last 24 hours is not being bought by the public.  Low or middle income earners up to &euro;70,000 know they will see a gain, albeit a modest one, in this budget.  All the talk by Deputy Crowe and his colleagues about the well heeled, the higher paid and so on is given the lie when we look at the measures.  No income above &euro;70,000 will benefit disproportionately from the tax measures.  Someone earning &euro;40,000 will benefit to a certain degree, someone earning &euro;50,000 will benefit a little more and someone earning &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 will benefit a little more again.  However, once we hit &euro;80,000 or &euro;87,000 - the salary my colleagues opposite enjoy along with all of us in this House - the benefit goes.  The cut-off is &euro;70,000.<\/p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies should face the facts.  They should find other things to criticise, by all means, and propose alternatives if they can.  They should stop trying to deny the facts of the matter.  The tax measures are progressive because there is no added benefit to somebody earning over &euro;70,000.  My colleagues should try to tell me if I am wrong.  Clearly, that is what the budget provides.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to Deputy McLellan, the budget places the family at the centre of our recovery by increasing child benefit and family income supplement, and by introducing paid paternity leave for the first time.  She can say it does not go far enough and there are comparators in Europe that do more.  She is right, I agree with her.  Here, we can get into having a realistic debate where people are saying we could and should do more.  However, Deputy McLellan should at least face the fact that for the first time ever we have introduced paid paternity leave in this country, a very short time after coming out of the worst recession and economic crisis we have ever had.  She should give some credit where it is due.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly pleased to see further progress towards universal health care through the extension of free GP visits to all children under 12.  This is a programme I had the privilege to instigate when I was Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.  Deputy Crowe made reference to it and I am not sure whether he was criticising it.  He was making a point about medical cards generally, I think.  Regarding free GP care, it is a progressive measure to introduce universal access to primary care, GP services.  It will be transformative for our health system.  I hope it has the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p><p>In fairness to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, when I was in the Department of Health, he always expressed to me his support for this measure.

He told me that he needed me to tell him that it was not just a measure up to age six and that we should go up to 12 and onwards.  I used to tell him that was our intention.  Here we are being true to the commitment we gave, and the commitment I gave to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in from Sinn F&eacute;in, that we were serious about extending free GP care from the under-sixes to the under-12s.  I expect it to be extended further to the entire community so that we can transform our health services by moving resources into primary care and where people have universal access to GP services irrespective of their income.  That is what we have done and we are sticking to our word and delivering that in this budget as well.<\/p>  <p>  It is also a budget that recognises and values our older citizens with increases in the weekly pension, the fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus.  Above all, this is a budget for continued employment growth, building on the efforts and policies that have seen over 130,000 jobs created since 2012.  I have just come back from an announcement by Sage that it is creating 300 new jobs at its headquarters in Sandyford.  These are quality jobs in Dublin, and there are examples elsewhere in the country.  This is further evidence that Ireland's sustainable, jobs-led recovery is bringing real benefits to our communities across Dublin and the whole country.  <\/p>  <p>  The budget will deliver progress on my priorities as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It will enhance and expand existing programmes to help our citizens, communities and small businesses to benefit from the many opportunities presented by our transition to a digital society and economy.  One of the things I most regret about the recession and the economic crisis, and there are many things to regret, is the gap in investment that grew up.  We redressed that in the capital plan and are now looking to invest seriously in transport and education, including building new schools.  Most important for me is investing in the digital economy and having the national broadband plan to ensure that every home and business in Ireland is served by high-speed broadband.  There is precious little about broadband in the Sinn F&eacute;in so-called pre-budget statement.  I can see no apparent allocation.

Those people deserve to get the benefits of a recovering economy, which is what this budget is essentially about.<\/p>  <p>  The economy is not an end in itself.  We also need to repair the social fabric of our country.  The budget does a lot to realise that.  Essentially, the era of cuts is over and we can look forward to investment in social services in areas like education.  It is not just investing in what was done before.  We also need to accompany that with reform of the way we do things.  This is very much part of what my predecessor and I have been doing in the area of education.  I have always believed, and have often argued, that investment in education is an economic, social and moral imperative.  When I was appointed Minister for Education and Skills, we faced a potential reduction in our budget in 2015 of &euro;39 million but working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, we managed to get an increase of &euro;60 million last year.  That allowed us to invest in some of the reforms that are necessary to deliver a modern, fit-for-purpose education for every child.  Over the past 12 months, I have been determined to build on that first increase in education spending in recent years.  The budget yesterday succeeded in that ambition.  In 2016, an additional &euro;144 million will be invested in education.  The figure quoted by Deputy O'Brien related to the new proposals regarding the pupil-teacher ratio and one other, but he did not include the ongoing reforms.  For example, he did not include the extra funding for junior cycle reform, the school book rental scheme, literacy and numeracy reform, the new apprenticeships we announced and the technological universities.  These are just some of them.  I will go into the detail of some of those later on.  That is why Deputy O'Brien's figure differs from our figure.  The additional investment in education is actually &euro;144 million this year.  <\/p>  <p>  My priority for additional investment has been to see smaller classes introduced at primary level.  Budget 2016 will deliver this important measure.  We have reduced class size back to the smallest class size we have ever had.  This is the start of our ambition and a new push to bring class sizes down over a number of years.  It is worth noting that even in the most difficult budgets of recent years, this Government protected class size.  The only recent cut was done by those on the Opposition benches.  I think Deputy Mattie McGrath might have been supporting Fianna F&aacute;il at the time.  The measures introduced in this budget will bring down average class sizes from 28 to 27.  It will begin the process of putting an end to classes of over 30 children.  <\/p>  <p>  I have said previously that no class should contain more than 30 children and that average class sizes should fall below 25 over the coming years.  The move in this direction this year will require approximately 300 additional teaching posts.  Additional teachers will also be provided at post-primary level.  A total of 550 new teaching posts will be provided and I expect more than half of these will be used to improve guidance counselling support in schools.  This will be done by reducing the pupil-teacher ratio from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for most schools and from 18.25:1 to 17.95.1 for disadvantaged schools.  While schools will have the autonomy to use this additional staffing in accordance with their needs, we are very conscious of the need for appropriate guidance counselling to be available to every student.  In fairness, I know that the Opposition is in agreement with that.  A new circular on guidance will issue in the spring and this will underpin the responsibility of every school to make sure it uses this additional staffing to meet their obligations to provide guidance counselling support to all students.  As Members will know, the Institute of Guidance Counsellors has been a very effective advocate for increased guidance resources and I welcome its support for this measure.  <\/p>  <p>  A total of 250 of these additional post-primary posts will also be used to enhance the role of deputy principals in schools with less than 500 students.  Strengthening leadership is schools is an important agenda.  It might not grab the headlines.  Indeed, additional resources in this regard often go unnoticed outside the school community but supporting leadership in schools has many positive benefits for students, teachers and other school staff.  Part of the allocation will allow deputy principals to reduce their teaching time and focus on leadership and management.  It will also provide additional release days to teaching principals in primary schools.  This is positive news for school leaders and school leadership and it builds on the work already done this year in establishing the Centre for School Leadership, which I announced earlier in the year.  These changes build upon the significant investment required to meet demographic growth in schools.  Next year alone, almost 14,000 additional students will be enrolled in our schools.  A total of 810 additional teachers are being provided to meet this additional number of children and young people.  Similarly, a further 600 additional resource teachers have been provided to support additional children with special education needs.  <\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, investment must go hand-in-hand with reform.  One area where the Government has driven reform is the area of apprenticeships.  Ireland has a world-class reputation in terms of our skilled craftspeople.  We regularly win top international competitions and did so very recently.  I congratulate those students.  Unfortunately, this national talent is often overlooked and does not receive the attention and celebration it deserves.  I want to see that change.  I will ensure that the apprenticeship model is extended to growing sectors of the economy.  We expect at least 4,000 additional apprentices to begin training next year.  Apprenticeships offer a high-quality career path for young people leaving school.  The apprenticeship model, which up until now was largely focused on the construction trades, is now being expanded into new career sectors such as financial services, travel, tourism and hospitality and other areas, such as HGV drivers.  <\/p><p>These apprenticeships will come on stream in 2016 and will be supported by more than &euro;10 million in funding.<\/p> <p> This is an important reform that the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and I worked hard to deliver.  I received support for this initiative from Members across the floor of this House, including Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, who is here today.  Technological universities will bring industry-connected university level education to regions around Ireland.  Three consortia have reached the final phase of moving to become technological universities in the south, south east and the Dublin area.  These consortia will next year benefit from additional funding.  A total of &euro;2 million is being made available to develop technological universities in Dublin, Munster and the south east.  A further &euro;3 million is being made available to invest in the student assistance fund and more generally for supporting disadvantaged students.  More funding will be needed for the higher and further education and training sectors over the coming years.  The expert group, chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells, will report at the end of the year.  That report will outline options for funding higher education in the future and I will publish it as soon as it becomes available.<\/p> <p> SOLAS, the Further Education and Training Authority, has begun reviewing the opportunities available in the further education and training sector.  This sector has been neglected but I want to ensure that we shine more light on it in the future because it really does provide opportunities for people to get meaningful, strong careers.  I have met many people in the further education colleges around the country who are benefitting from those opportunities.  SOLAS will complete a review of post-leaving certificate courses next spring and then move on to examine other opportunities in further education and training.  As it carries out that work I will support it, just as I have by prioritising investment in apprenticeships today.<\/p> <p> We have achieved a great deal in reforming education in recent years.  Budget 2016 will ensure that we can continue this important work.  This year we saw the first improvement in reading and mathematics in a generation, results due in part at least to our successful literacy and numeracy strategy.  I am delighted to continue funding the implementation of that strategy with an allocation of &euro;17 million, an increase of &euro;3 million compared with this year.  Reform of junior cycle will also continue with an &euro;8 million increase in funding of this reform bringing the total allocation up to &euro;17 million.  This funding will be used for teacher training, giving teachers professional time to engage with the reforms and for curriculum development.  I am pleased to inform the House that continuing professional development for junior cycle will begin in the coming weeks.  The first phase will focus on the education and training board, ETB, sector where the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI represents most teachers. <\/p> <p> I have provided &euro;2.5 million in funding in 2016 to replace the philanthropic funding which has been raised to promote music to children through Music Generation.  We are investing &euro;9 million to ensure the high-speed broadband, which has been installed in all post-primary schools, thanks to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, is available to them free of charge.<\/p> <p> On top of these important areas this year I have secured &euro;2 million in funding to support new curriculums, which includes the revised primary languages curriculum and the roll-out of politics and society as a new leaving certificate subject.  It will also support the revised curriculums for art, design and communications for leaving certificate.  I am also providing the final tranche of &euro;5 million in a three-year additional investment in the school books fund which does relieve some of the pressure on parents with regard to the cost of education.<\/p> <p> A minor works grant will issue to all primary and special schools in November, totalling &euro;28.5 million.  There will also be a summer works scheme over 2016 and 2017, for which funding of &euro;80 million has been allowed.<\/p> <p> I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, for what has been achieved in early years education.  We have been working closely with him on this issue and I commend him particularly for his support for children with special needs.  We see education as a continuum and early years are extremely important.  I am delighted we have been able to achieve significant progress in the education budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400036#JJ00800","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444834800,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I am involved in a national school and welcome the reduction of numbers for a three teacher school from 56 to 55.

Some Ministers have stepped up to the mark and delivered certain things.  We would have liked more, as everyone would.  I thank the Minister for Education and Skills for those grants because I haunt her now and again about them.<\/p>  <p>  Road tax for hauliers is a vital issue.  I have been dealing with it for the past year.  It cost &euro;4,500 to tax a lorry in Southern Ireland.  It cost &pound;900 to tax the same vehicle in the North.  Irish hauliers were at a distinct disadvantage when they went to the North .  They were being crucified by having to pay &pound;10 a day while there, as a penalty for driving on the roads there.  I made submissions on it to see if there was any way we could hit drivers coming down here to alleviate the &euro;4,500 tax for the articulated lorries.  The haulage industry has been forgotten for many a year and it is welcome that it has received some recognition.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of money working parents must pay out for child care is a nightmare and a headache.  It is a welcome step in the right direction that this goes to age five or five and a half now.  There are working families who must pay to have their children looked after from 12 p.m.  The child care package covers care only from 9 a.m. to 12 or 12.30 p.m.  After that someone else has to step in and pay.  I know there is not enough money to throw around but that would have helped middle Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Brussels yesterday with Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony and Senator Paschal Mooney, from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  While there, we monitored what was being said here.  I noted the Minister said the reduced VAT rate is coming to an end because Dublin hotels are booming.  He needs, however, to understand that there are hotels in the country that will need this rate for a few more years to lift them off the ground.  If the Department of Finance is thinking of increasing the VAT rate in Dublin it needs to make sure that something is there for the hotels in the country.<\/p>  <p>  I do not see much in this budget for the development of rural Ireland.  We heard the announcement of a &euro;30 million programme at the National Ploughing Championship, which is welcome.  We need enhancements, be it rates in small towns, or giving credit unions the environment to trade and compete.  They are the new banks in rural parts of Ireland.  They want a fair chance to clear their money at the same price as a bank.  They want the facilities to issue a card and get direct debits up and running.  That is crucial and will be one of the pillars of the revival of rural Ireland.  That will not take money.  It will take an announcement and probably legislation to make sure it is done.<\/p>  <p>  Everything the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced today was there already, bar the partnership.  While he is singing and dancing about the partnership he must remember it is not for a 20, 30 or 40 acre farm.  That will not keep the youngster at home.  That could be done by making GLAS simpler by having two farmers with the same terms and conditions.  He is not doing that, rather he is making it more complicated.  The beef genomics scheme is complicated.  Sad to say, the Minister does not understand what a small farm is because everything is aimed at the big farm.  That is not how things will work.<\/p><p> I welcome the relief for microbreweries because this is an avenue by which we can create employment.  It is a forward step and we should encourage young entrepreneurs.  I also welcome the capital gains relief.  These are the kinds of thing that help a society.<\/p> <p> The air ambulance service has been announced two or three times this year in connection with Roscommon County Hospital, but, whether a sum of &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million is announced, the air ambulance does not fly at night.  That is what we have to conquer.  To provide the service in the region, never mind one area, we have to make sure it flies at night.  It is possible to get helicopters that can be flown at night and we have to make sure we have them for those who need them.<\/p> <p> I hope NAMA is watched when it comes to housing.  Nobody argues that we do not need housing - we need it urgently - but I am not in favour of modular housing because we will make people from other countries rich while we have all the material, all the know-how and all the skills we need to build houses.  If we are facing an obstacle and need to bring in every Member rapidly to pass emergency legislation to ensure houses are built on a greenfield site and without having to import them, we should do it.  If we import a house that costs &euro;100, it is money that is going out of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400037#KK00200","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444835400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>They are made in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400038#LL00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1444835400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Some are but most are imported.

I was in Brussels yesterday and we need to explore every avenue such as TEN-T funding which is available in adjoining two countries such as Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

If we do not create the environment, it will not happen.<\/p>  <p>  There are some good things in the budget.  While I would like more of some things, I would not slate every aspect of it.

Deputy Brendan Howlin holds a prestigious position among the big four in the Government, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach, but 100,000 older people are living in deprivation.  They are not my words but those of respected organisations and the likes of Fr. Peter McVerry.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, could not deliver a house yesterday, not even a prefab.  He would not deliver a hen house and has been a shambles.  There is a housing and homelessness crisis in which people are dying on the streets day after day.  Some 2,000 family units were approved in Tipperary, the Minister's own county, where 5,600 people are on the waiting list, but he has not delivered a dozen houses in his term as Minister.  He talks a load of codswallop about the delivery of this and that, but not even a hen house or a tree house has been delivered.  His Department and the local authorities will not deliver houses either.  The people who can build them are in the voluntary housing sector, but they are being overlooked because there is no profit to be made and none of them is involved in a big company.  Somebody else is going to come in and supply prefab houses and they will make profits.  As my colleague said, it is not a good idea to create fat cats elsewhere.<\/p><p>NAMA should never have been set up as it does not act in the interests of ordinary people, yet the Minister for Finance is depending on it to deliver 90,000 houses, some 90% of which will be in Dublin and to hell with the rest of the country - anyone outside the Pale does not matter.  I am surprised at him, but that is the way the Government has acted.  They will probably deliver no more than 90 for their friends who will not sell houses to people.  I have a book in my hand entitled, <i>Waiting for the Sheriff.  <\/i>That is what hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for.  I know a man in Tipperary who was given an eviction letter yesterday during the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>What will he do given that he will be out of his house?  He is in a very serious and perilous situation, as are many others throughout the country.<\/p> <p> The Government Members have lost sight of the ordinary people and they are in a cocoon.  I saw some Government Members last night who were ecstatic with the budget.  They must think the people are wicked fools altogether if they are going to believe this.  I recognise the effort the Government has made in some areas.  I welcome it and give credit where credit is due.  However, we need to remember the torture, the inhumanity.<\/p> <p> This book contains the names of 90 Government Members who voted for the eviction Bill - the so-called Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act.  It is eviction legislation to make sheriffs and receivers richer and fatter through their disgusting charges.  The way they are treating the people is inappropriate by putting members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na out there, if they have not enough to do, to defend the sheriffs and receivers.  It is a low-grade industry that is paralysing people and has no interest in anybody.  They are only interested in how much money they can make.<\/p> <p> In some cases the wives or partners of the sheriffs are already the highest court officers in the land.  It is despicable and disgusting, but it is all fine because they are all friends of Government Members.  It is all friends of Government Members who are appointed to the Judiciary.  They promised us new politics and a new era of transparency.  This is the most non-transparent Government.<\/p> <p> When I first became a Member of this House eight years ago we had a budget day and we had everything in the budget.  It started to change shortly after I arrived, but now we get the budget the week before.  Last Friday night in the middle of a terrible tragedy in Dublin, the Government was able to announce &euro;1.5 billion, a massive Supplementary Estimate, for health.  Why can the Minister not be honest with the people who are waiting for four years for an operation in pain and agony?  Why can he not put the money into the hospitals?  Why can he not support the front-line nurses and doctors?  He comes out with his codswallop about having a free GP-visit card for under 12s, without any consultation with the AGP or IMO.  He promised to renegotiate a 40 year old contract.  He can run but he cannot hide.  He cannot bully the people.  Thankfully, young children are normally the healthiest people, except for the ones with special needs and serious illnesses.<\/p> <p> The Government has savagely taken medical cards from older people and left them to die in agony.  We also have the issue with the trolley count.  Why will the Minister not deal with those people and give them medical cards when they need them without any duress and trauma?  The same applies with special needs assistants in schools.<\/p> <p> The Government parties want to look after the rich, the people who fill their coffers, who go to their breakfast mornings and dinners to support them.  The Labour Party Members should be ashamed of themselves.  They came to Clonmel to hold a conference two years ago and they could not even hold it.  That is a sad state of affairs from what used to be an honourable party.  Someone said the Labour Party Deputies would come back here after the general election in a minibus.  I think they will come back in a hybrid car, which might only be a two-seater, possibly a four-seater or at most a seven-seater.  The people are furious with Labour because it has abandoned them.  It has abandoned them in the countryside, in the streets of Dublin and everywhere else.<\/p> <p> The Government will not pass legislation.  On three occasions I introduced a Bill, the Scrap and Precious Metal Dealers Bill, to protect people in their homes.  It will not look at the bail laws.  It has too many friends who are solicitors and there are too many Cabinet members who are solicitors and barristers.  It will not look at free legal aid because it has too many people making too much money out of it.  However, it will allow people to be persecuted in their homes in County Tipperary and everywhere else without giving them any protection.  It can pass law after law on gay marriage and abortion - anything bar legislation to protect and support the citizens of the country who go out and work every day.  They are the entrepreneurs in business who give employment and want to give employment.  However, the Government wants to stick to its fancy work in legislation - nothing that would put bread and butter on the table.  That would not matter to the Labour Party anymore.  It is the modern liberal party.  It wants to make its dent in government and it has made a fair dent in it, but, by God, it will not be able to make much of a dent after the general election.<\/p> <p> As for the Taoiseach, it is enough for me to say Castlebar is closed down.  It is a sad town.  People are telling me that the gates are locked on the one business and industrial estate, which is a sad indictment.  This morning a man told Deputy Fitzmaurice that people cannot walk on the bogs the Government is trying to close down.  People have been cutting turf for hundreds of years.  We want someone to vindicate our rights and not to be dictated to by Europe and worse still dictated to by officials here in Ireland.  Let the people live.  They will live if they are let live and not persecuted with taxes after taxes, while big business is being supported.  On NAMA, I could think of another acronym to describe it better.  I said on the night it was established it was like a wild animal being released in the woods; no one would know where it would end up.<\/p> <p> The Government thinks it will deliver 90,000 houses; it will not deliver 90 and they will be for its friends.  They will not sell the houses.  I spoke about a man being evicted today.  It will not sell the house to his brother-in-law because it wants to sell it to its friends.  This is disgusting corruption that is going on in this country and the Government should be ashamed of itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400038#LL01200","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444836000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>When is the Deputy rejoining Fianna F&aacute;il?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400039#MM00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1444836000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, proposes to share time with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.

This is my second year as Minister for Health to address the House on this matter and, as was the case last year, I am pleased to be here to talk about a budget that provides additional funding for public services such as health, education and child care.<\/p>  <p>  The budget will assist in continuing the improvement of the economy.  It will create an environment to sustain more jobs, more investment in public services, health, child care, education and more housing, in particular, social housing.<\/p>  <p>  Last year we were able to achieve the first modest budget increase in health service funding in seven years.  Additional funding was provided during the course of 2015 to address delayed discharges from acute hospitals, waiting lists and emergency department overcrowding.  I am pleased to announce that the Government is asking the Oireachtas to allocate additional Exchequer funding for the health sector for 2016.  The gross current budget for the health sector for 2016 is &euro;13.175 billion.  This is equivalent to an increase of &euro;880 million compared with the 2015 allocation of &euro;12.295 billion voted through last year.  This represents a 7% increase on the budget for 2015 and a 12% increase on the voted budget for 2014.  It is an indication of the Government's commitment to addressing the reductions experienced by the health sector arising from the economic downturn.<\/p>  <p>  Our spending ceiling continues to rise and once again, all savings and efficiencies achieved will be available to reinvest in improving health services.  Some &euro;817 million will be available to address service pressures.  Funding to cover the full-year cost of a number of initiatives commenced in 2015 - commitments under the Lansdowne Road agreement and the programme for Government.  The remaining &euro;63 million goes to meet the residual cost of once-off measures introduced in 2015.  In addition, savings and efficiencies of &euro;125 million have been identified in the areas of procurement, prescribing and drug costs, bringing the total available to support existing levels of service and new developments to &euro;942 million.<\/p>  <p>  The funding secured will ease the pressure on the health service to continue providing the optimum level of safe services for patients within the budgetary limits.  However, it is essential that we continue to focus on cost containment and cost avoidance as there continue to be major cost pressures on the health service.  We have an increased and aging population, an increase in chronic conditions, and new expensive medicines and technologies that we must fund.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that there will be no change to hospital or prescription charges, the monthly DPS threshold, or income thresholds for eligibility for medical or GP-visit cards.  Funding for the fair deal will be maintained at a level to keep waiting times at a maximum of four weeks.  I believe this shows the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to stabilising the direct cost of health services for citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful to my colleagues, the Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin, for their support and understanding in dealing with the challenges faced by the health sector.<\/p>  <p>  The level of health services to be provided within the available funding will be set out in the HSE&rsquo;s 2016 national service plan which is being prepared by the executive.  I want to take the opportunity to outline some of the issues which will be more extensively covered in the service plan.  Funding is being provided to reduce delayed discharges from our hospitals and emergency department overcrowding and to provide for ongoing implications of winter capacity planning.<\/p>  <p>  I have taken a personal interest in emergency department overcrowding and have secured &euro;74 million in additional funding this year to alleviate the problem.  This funding came on top of measures already taken in budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressure on, acute hospitals.  This has allowed the waiting time for the nursing home support scheme to be reduced from 15 weeks to four, which in turn has reduced delayed discharges in hospitals from 850 to under 600 - it is actually down to 560 today - freeing up 250 acute beds in hospitals.  It has also allowed us to open another 150 district hospital beds, including at Mount Carmel community hospital, formerly a private hospital.<\/p>  <p>  More community beds will be opened before the end of the year.  It has also allowed us to increase investment in health services and keep patients out of hospital altogether, or allow them to get home earlier, thanks to community intervention teams, day hospitals and acute medical admission units.  This funding rolls into the budget for 2016 in order to continue this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  While we have seen an improvement in patient experience times in our emergency departments, and a fall in numbers of people waiting on a trolley for more than nine hours, morning peak overcrowding has not improved and is still worse than the same point last year.  I understand the distress and hardship that all of this is causing to patients and their families and, of course, staff.  Further additional funding of &euro;18 million was provided in July for a winter initiative, which starts in a few weeks time.  This includes the provision of approximately 30 additional beds in hospitals across the country in November and December.<\/p><p>The director general and his team are visiting the worst affected hospitals to see what can be done to address other blockages such as diagnostics and rapid access to outpatient services.  It is also clear that we need more weekend discharges, more evening ward rounds to reduce length of stay and for senior decision-makers to review patients shortly after or before admission in order to reduce unnecessary admissions and length of stay.  The full year cost of the winter initiative is being provided to run into 2016, as we will need it for that part of the winter also.<\/p> <p> In 2015 significant investment was made to improve the standard of care in residential services for people with a disability, through providing enhanced staffing levels and improving the quality and standard of their surroundings.  That investment will continue in 2016 to further improve facilities and to advance the policy of de-congregation of institutions and supporting people to live more self-directed lives in the community.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to the negotiation of a comprehensive new GP contract with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  The negotiations have commenced and I look forward to them producing results which we can start to implement in 2016.  In the context of the talks, the Government yesterday signalled that it was providing for the extension, in the latter part of 2016, of GP care without fees to children aged between six and 11 years.  That will be subject to negotiation with the IMO in relation to the scope of the service to be provided and the fee arrangements to apply and will be implemented in the context of overall new arrangements and not as a stand-alone extension or amendment to the current contract.<\/p> <p> As clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to primary care, funding will be provided in the service plan to expand direct access for GPs to ultrasound and X-ray.  It will reduce the need for people to be referred to hospital to access these investigations on an outpatient basis or through the emergency department which currently occurs on occasion.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to the development of a modern, patient-centred, and recovery-orientated mental health service.  We are committed, in particular, to reforming our model of delivery in order that more and better quality mental health care is delivered in the community in line with A Vision for Change.  Since coming into office, the Government has increased funding by &euro;125 million for mental health and suicide prevention and there will be a further increase in funding in 2016.<\/p> <p> I am committed also to improving access to therapy services.  Accordingly, funding is being provided, as announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to expand the provision of speech and language therapy within the primary care setting and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the progressing disability services programme for children and young people.  That will include funding for the development of early intervention services to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream preschool settings, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly.<\/p> <p> The further improvement of maternity services is a priority for me, and I am pleased to confirm that additional funding will be provided in the service plan for further maternity service developments in 2016.  That will include the necessary funding to establish the national women and infants programme, which is intended to drive improvements and standardise care across all 19 maternity units based on the model successfully used previously for the national cancer control programme.  In recognition of the fact that there are staffing deficits in maternity hospitals, and our staffing ratios do not compare well internationally, even if outcomes do, funding will be provided to reduce front-line staff pressures through the appointment of additional midwives, consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists.<\/p> <p> As promised, development funding will also be provided for necessary posts in the Dublin Midlands Maternity Network, the country&rsquo;s first managed clinical maternity network between the Coombe and Portlaoise hospitals.  In addition, resources will be provided to ensure that every maternity unit has a director of midwifery in place, a recommendation of the HIQA report on Portlaoise.  Funding will also be provided to establish bereavement teams in all units and to support the implementation of the maternal neonatal clinical management system which is due to be phased in, initially on a pilot basis early next year.<\/p> <p> Significant advances have been made in the National Ambulance Service in 2015, in particular, with the opening of the new national emergency operations centre in Tallaght and the establishment of a single control and dispatch system.  In 2016, funding will be provided to build on those improvements and, in particular, to address deficits in the provision of services in rural areas as well as the development of community first responder schemes and increasing capacity in intermediate care, critical retrieval and children&rsquo;s ambulance services.<\/p> <p> The recently announced capital envelope provides funding to continue the major programme of investment to replace, upgrade and refurbish health care facilities.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, a capital allocation of more than &euro;3 billion is being provided.  This includes a significant increase in funding of &euro;568 million over the period of the plan.  The increased funding available in the later years provides scope for the commitment of additional investment concentrated towards the end of the programme.<\/p> <p> In addition to the five priority projects and the wider capital programme, the additional funding will enable further progress in delivering accommodation compliance in many areas of social care.  Quality accommodation is important in supporting the needs of older people and people with disabilities who need long-term care.  Additional funding of &euro;300 million over the 2016 to 2021 multi-annual period will enable an expanded programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish long-term care facilities.<\/p> <p> The further enhancement of maternity services through the co-location of maternity hospitals with adult acute hospitals will also be carried forward.  Co-location enables critical care facilities, such as ICU, to be shared, ensures specialists are nearby and that mothers are not separated from their babies if either mother or baby becomes very sick.  The increased funding will enable the development of a wider maternity capital programme towards the later years of the programme.<\/p> <p> Both my Department and the HSE recognise that continually strengthening accountability and good governance within the health service is of critical importance.  For that reason, the HSE&rsquo;s 2015 national service plan included, at my request, an enhanced accountability framework which makes explicit the responsibilities of all managers to reach the targets set out in the service plan across the balanced scorecard of quality and safety, access, finance, and HR.  A key feature of the framework has been the introduction of formal performance agreements at several levels within the HSE and the establishment of a national performance oversight group to serve as the key accountability mechanism for the health service.  The group meets with each national director for services each month and completes a full assessment of all key measures across the divisional balanced scorecards.  Areas of underperformance are identified and explanations and remedial actions are sought.  Where performance does not improve, the matter is escalated according to the escalation and intervention process developed by the HSE, which is up and running since April.  At each level of escalation, there is a clear distinction between supports, interventions and sanctions and there is a menu of options available under each heading.<\/p> <p> While the escalation and intervention process is still in its early stages, a number of significant improvements in performance have been made as a result of the level of focus and scrutiny placed on areas of underperformance.  These include improvements in the number of child and adolescent mental health patients waiting for more than 12 months for a first appointment and a reduction in the number of patients waiting for more than four weeks for an urgent colonoscopy.  Recently, the HSE has begun to take measures against some hospitals that are not meeting their targets in respect of waiting times for inpatient and outpatient treatment.<\/p> <p> The need for ongoing strengthened accountability and good governance within the HSE, voluntary hospitals and other voluntary bodies remains of critical importance in 2016.  The HSE is involved in an ongoing review of the accountability framework, which will focus on its operation, effectiveness and application throughout the organisation to date in 2015.  The review will identify the changes that are required in order to improve the process and will examine, in particular, the intervention and support processes in place to address areas of underperformance.  The outcome will be reflected in the HSE&rsquo;s 2016 national service plan which will detail how the executive intends to develop and build on the framework in 2016 to further enhance and strengthen accountability arrangements next year.<\/p> <p> Before concluding I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of health care staff throughout the country who provide a good service in what can be very challenging circumstances.  There are problems with the health service but there are also many positive elements which too often get overlooked.  We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered and reduce costs in order to minimise any negative effect on service provision.  We have secured an increase in funding for the health service but I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of a safe, efficient health service for Irish patients.  I remain focused on meeting the challenge in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400039#MM00400","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444836600,"counter":415,"content":"<p>The additional funding for the Department of Health this year will ensure services are provided for people on a daily basis.  As the Minister correctly pointed out at the end of his contribution, the majority of people who interact with the health service have a very good experience.  That is because we have an incredibly well qualified and excellent workforce across the range of health services.<\/p>  <p>  The areas for which I have responsibility are mental health, disabilities, older people and primary care, which are an integral part of the health service.  The Minister referred to his commitment to maternity services.  We are now reviewing the implementation of A Vision for Change in order to ensure we do not have the gaps which were there in the past.  A Vision for Change will come to an end next year and we intend to ensure another plan is in place to continue on from where it finishes.<\/p><p>It will not be a completely new plan but it most definitely will build on what already is there.  In this respect, we intend to take a serious look at a perinatal psychiatry service.  It always strikes me that Ireland does not appear to have the same level of postnatal depression as do other countries, which cannot possibly be true.  It simply is because we do not look for it here and the provision of that new service will ensure it will be possible to do so.  As for the additional funding for mental health services in the coming year, substantial changes already have been made.  It is a service in transition and that is changing dramatically from an institution-based service to a community one that sometimes uses an acute unit service when that is necessary.  Next year, the priority will be on primary care and for the first time ever, the primary care and mental health services will be sitting at the same table.  It always has astonished me that this had not been done previously but it will be done now.  Moreover, we will ensure an expansion of the type of services we started to deliver last year in primary care.  I refer to services such as counselling in primary care for the over 18s where people with mild to moderate depression who attend at their GP can be transferred directly into counselling without being obliged to first present to the acute service or the psychiatric services.  This counselling service worked so well it ran out of money and the figures are quite incredible in this regard.  Last year, there were more than 10,000 referrals and more than 31,000 sessions were delivered, albeit not all by people who work for the Health Service Executive, HSE, but by a range of counsellors within the community.  Next year, we intend to expand that service and to ensure people under 18 equally have access to it.  It should not always be the case that people who have difficulty with their emotional or psychological well-being automatically end up in the mental health services as there are other routes and we intend to ensure that such people can take them.<\/p> <p> As for psychology in primary care, there is a shortage and an underdevelopment of psychology services across the country, which has resulted in reduced access to initial assessment.  Better access will help to prevent the escalation of presentation to specialist services.  At a human level, early diagnosis and intervention can lead to better mental health outcomes and a better quality of life and this is something to which all Members can commit.  I am committed to developing a more fit-for-purpose primary care psychology service, which will be a stepped-care model integrated with the specialist service to enhance the service and reduce waiting times.  I have asked the HSE to examine how counselling psychologists and clinical psychologists can contribute to developing the primary care psychology service.  I have been concerned for some time that because the only psychologists mentioned in A Vision for Change are clinical psychologists, they appear to be the only people we are intent on employing, even though the HSE always has employed counselling psychologists and they work extraordinarily well.  We seriously examined the waiting list for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and discovered there were ways to reduce that list and lessen the amount of time people will spend on it.  Sometimes it is not all about resources but thankfully, significant resources are available in respect of mental health.<\/p> <p> As for speech and language therapies, the Government has committed an additional &euro;8 million to provide therapeutic services for children.  This will be targeted at young children with a disability to enable them to go to preschool.  It also will address a more general need of those under 18 who need speech and language occupational therapy and psychotherapy.  Speech and language therapy interventions can make the difference between a child integrating in social and educational settings and that child remaining isolated.<\/p> <p> I always have maintained that one solution to overcrowded hospitals is within the community.  While it is not the entire solution, it most definitely is part of it.  I intend to continue to ensure that all departments with responsibility in the primary care setting come together, such as primary care in respect of mental health, as they must be at the same table.  It is a service that must be delivered in primary care but by the mental health service.  Moreover, when it comes to children and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, again this sort of interaction and integration must happen.  We have made incredible strides in ensuring that older people who need long-term care will have that more readily and I intend to ensure this continues as it is.  The Government is making progress but people must accept the progress it is making is about changing a system fundamentally, which takes time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400040#NN00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444837200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Billy Timmins is sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400041#OO00200","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1444837200,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, Thomas P.

I have made it in the past and it would cost little or no money, namely, a requirement for medical professionals who must deliver bad news to do so in an appropriate manner and in an appropriate location.  I interact repeatedly with people who have received bad news or whose family has received bad news in a corridor in a less than compassionate manner.  In Britain, there is a standard mechanism to do this and while people may be obliged to attend a course or whatever, this is a matter I would like the Minister to take up.<\/p>  <p>  I almost feel as though a campaign slogan or poster slogan is coming over me, that is, \"Make work pay; continue the recovery\".  Between them, the Taoiseach's two speeches mentioned this perhaps ten or 15 times, as did each Minister who spoke.  It is good to see the focus group is alive and well and the Government is adhering to the strict instructions it gets to utter the slogan, \"Make work pay; continue the recovery\" at every hand's turn.  As for budgets, I must be honest and state I am not someone who really buys into the concept of budget day.  Yesterday, for example, Members came into the Chamber to hear the Budget Statement but for several days or weeks beforehand, most of the information was in the media.  It obviously was given out deliberately by handlers to soften up and manipulate the public.  Members of one political party had extensive documentary details of the budget to hand in the Chamber before the speeches actually took place.  Indeed, they had them as they made their way into the Chamber.  <\/p>  <p>  On the expenditure side, it is important to realise that what was under discussion yesterday was &euro;770 million, yet total Government expenditure is approximately &euro;55 billion.  The entire focus is brought to bear on the aforementioned &euro;770 million and the big picture is missed.  I acknowledge there were many things one likes to see, such as the increase in child benefit, the land transfer proposals for farmers, the 2,260 new teachers, the return of the respite grants, the old age pension increase and the preschool measures.  In many respects, these are all welcome in their own right but this misses the bigger picture.<\/p>  <p>  If Members really wish to make work pay, they must consider the tax system.  Renua Ireland has put forward a proposal for a new flat tax system and I urge people to familiarise themselves with it because it will improve access to employment and will make work pay.  It will make employees work more hours and will make employers create more employment because ultimately, before the Government gives money for anything, it must take it away from someone.  I do not believe it is fair that 50% of additional income is being taken away from people and irrespective of what is their income, it must be fair.  As one hears constantly, Ireland has a progressive tax system but it also is a penal tax system.  Renua Ireland proposes a progressive and fair tax system.  While we want to look after vulnerable people, we also want to address why people are in the welfare trap.  I acknowledge the closing of the anomaly at the lower end of the pay scale which has existed for the last couple of years and which prevented people from taking on employment.  However, the only way in which the welfare trap and low pay really can be addressed is through the mechanism of changing fundamentally the tax system.  I would like people to familiarise themselves with the flat tax system.  Renua has brought forward a proposal for a flat tax rate of 23% across the board with a graduated basic income.  Members should check the figures; it does work.  It would leave the Exchequer approximately &euro;3.5 billion short of the intake from income tax at present but based on factors such as tax shelters, increased economic activity and the reduction in the black economy, Renua is more than confident, based on tried and tested models and experience elsewhere, that it would work.<\/p>  <p>  In a nutshell, much was omitted from the budget.<\/p><p>There is nothing in it about mortgage arrears or Irish Water.  In terms of the capital expenditure on health, I would like funding to be made available in the next few weeks for St. Colman's Hospital which is in my constituency.  While the aspirations around housing are fine in theory I am not sure they will work.  I do not believe the Government and NAMA have thought out their proposal for the construction of thousands of additional housing over the next few years.  I do not know if any concrete plan in this regard has been put in place.<\/p> <p> In a nutshell, in putting all the emphasis on delivery of an election budget the Government has missed the bigger picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400041#OO00500","speaker":"1207","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444837800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank Deputy Billy Timmins for sharing time with me.  Having listened to all of the pre-budget hype and all of the speeches made yesterday one gets the strong sense of history repeating itself.  This budget would do Bertie Ahern proud.  It is very much a pre-election budget.  It is a budget aimed at spreading the small amount of jam available as thinly as possible in order to buy different cohorts of voters.  It shows little foresight in terms of the need to tackle some of the key problems in this country and the need to engage in long-term planning.  It is extraordinary that despite all of the awfulness arising out of the recession and all of the talk at the time that these things could never be allowed to happen again we are getting back into the dangerous territory of budgets being used to buy votes, with no consideration of their impact on the country in the long term.  Not only is there no appreciation in this budget of the need for long-term planning, it shows no ambition for the country in terms of reform or vision in relation to the type of country we want Ireland to be.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to split the &euro;1.5 billion available on a 50:50 basis between tax cuts and investment in services was a very serious mistake.  During the recession the split between cuts in services and increases in tax was 2:1, which was an indication that this Government favoured the slashing of public services.  Only one third of the adjustment went towards tax increases.  The money available should not be split in that way.  Given what happened to services during the recession all the available funding should have been invested in restoring our services to an acceptable level.  <\/p>  <p>  The burden of taxation over recent years has been shifted away from the better off to people on low and modest incomes.  With the slashing of services came increases in VAT which made the cost of living much more expensive, the imposition of property tax and water charges and, for many older people, the loss of the waiver in respect of waste charges.  Many of the additional charges imposed on people remain in place.  The Government should have taken this opportunity to re-invest in the types of services that are important to people.  In terms of the shortcomings of those services, according to the statistics there are 500,000 people on waiting lists for hospital services; 130,000 people on local authority housing lists and the number of children living in consistent poverty has doubled over the period of the recession.  There are also lengthy waiting lists for social workers because of the under-funding of Tusla.  There are a vast number of services that need to be reinstated but, unfortunately, the Government has taken a very short term view in that regard.  This budget is all about the upcoming general election.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most stark elements of the budget is the fact that despite the huge problems in our health service, the Government is providing only an additional &euro;18 million in that area.  That the same level of allocation is made in respect of the commemoration programme for next year as is made in the health area says a lot.  Housing is another major area that has been overlooked.  The budget makes no provision in regard to rent certainty and does nothing to bring on-stream vacant properties that could be utilised to help tackle the housing problem.  <\/p>  <p>  This budget is a missed opportunity.  What the Government has done in regard to taxation cuts is regressive.  Yet again we have a budget from the Government that will substantially widen the gap between rich and poor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400042#PP00200","speaker":"1203"},{"type":"speech","time":1444837800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>With the impending general election the long suffering people finally got some respite yesterday from the implacable austerity forced on them since late 2008.  In my own submission a few weeks to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, I called again for many of the positive social expenditure measures that have been included in the Government's final budget in office.  Among these, which it would be churlish not to acknowledge, are the extension of the early childhood care and education scheme from three years and two months to primary school entry, the restoration of the respite care grant to &euro;1,700, the increase in the fuel allowance to &euro;22.50, the partial restoration of child benefit by &euro;5 and the investment in education to slightly reduce the pupil-teacher-ratio from 27:1 for primary schools and 18.7:1 for second level students.<\/p>  <p>  Senior constituents, some of whom I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, met in Dublin Bay North this morning, were not greatly enthused by the &euro;3 per week increase in pensions, even if it is the first rise since 2009.  This partial restoration of levels of benefit and income for the most vulnerable after seven years of brutal austerity cannot undo the damage already done to households and individuals.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest disappointment of budget 2016 is, as my colleague Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall said, the Government's failure, particularly the Labour Party, to declare a housing emergency.  The plan for NAMA to deliver 20,000 housing units by the end of 2020, with 90% to be delivered in Dublin, is simply a re-run of the old failed developer-led system.  Ministers plan to give responsibility for the urgent construction of tens of thousands of homes to developers who built so many substandard fire-traps up to 2009 and have sat on their land banks while they emerged from bankruptcy, supported by us, the taxpayers and NAMA covering up for their reckless failures.  The paltry increase of &euro;20 million to ensure 3,000 social housing units are delivered in 2016 will assist only 3% or less of the citizens and households on housing waiting lists.  The increase of &euro;69 million for social housing is also paltry when the actual housing budget of &euro;414 million remains less than one quarter or one fifth of what is actually needed.  There was nothing announced yesterday in regard to rent certainty, except for the T&aacute;naiste's statement that it has all been decided.  Why was this most critical issue not included in the budget?<\/p>  <p>  One of the most ludicrous announcements yesterday from the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, was that the overall budget for health has been restored to pre-crash levels of over &euro;13 billion.  However, he was contradicted by the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who rightly said that the health budget is at least &euro;1 billion off its pre-crash peak in nominal terms.  The Department of Health budget was decimated during the austerity years and while the spend is &euro;13.2 billion, how much has been lost cumulatively since 2008?  How does one quantify the suffering of patients on waiting lists, in chaotic accident and emergency departments and the desperately hard-pressed staff trying to care for them?  There was no mention in the current or capital budgets about the urgently needed new accident and emergency department for Beaumont Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  As stated by Deputy Billy Timmins, there is nothing in this budget about the elephant in the room, namely, Irish Water.  Citizens want to know how much more of taxpayers' money will be pumped into this direly malfunctioning utility.  The ferocious vice-grip of the EU expenditure rules was again evident in the 2016 budget for the Department of Social Protection in terms of the retention of the cap on social protection spending at under &euro;19 billion.  Increases for this year are based on increases in the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  I put forward options in my own budget submission to gain significant yields for the Exchequer from fair additional taxation, which I am sure, along with other proposals from this side of the House, ended up in the bottom draw of the Minister for Finance.  Among my suggestions was the introduction of a 48% rate of tax on incomes over &euro;100,000; a financial transaction tax , FTT, starting with an increase in stamp duty on shares; a solidarity and reparations tax on financial institutions; and a fully effective 12.5% corporation tax.  A few weeks ago, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall highlighted during parliamentary questions the additional revenue that an effective rate of corporation tax would provide. <\/p>  <p>  In his closing remarks yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, asked, \"Who speaks of Syriza now?\"  This incredible hubris was apparently prompted by the crushing euro restructuring settlement imposed on Alex Tsipras and his Government by Chancellor Merkel and company, but there is a huge difference between Alex Tsipras's Government and the Government of the Taoiseach which the Greek people recently recognised in their recent re-election of Syriza.  Syriza at least tried to renegotiate with the Eurogroup.  This outgoing Government never even tried and its failure to even try will result in a huge loss of seats next spring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400042#PP00300","speaker":"1190"},{"type":"speech","time":1444838400,"counter":424,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Peter Mathews who has four minutes and 40 seconds.

Where is the courage?  It is nowhere to be seen because proper stock has not been taken of the resources, incomes and wealth in this country in setting the scene for the plan for next year.  It has been a failure of the Department of Finance and advisers not to point out that in the past 25 years the returns on wealth and capital have been steady every year, at 6% to 8% without fail.  Where has there been even a timid effort made to ask corporate multinationals to pay their share for the services they enjoy in setting up here?  The wealth of the 300 wealthiest people in the country has grown by &euro;15 billion in one year.  The 6% growth in GDP that the Government vaunts amounts to a figure of &euro;10.8 billion, yet the Government states the taxation system is fair - not a bit of it.<\/p><p>David McWilliams has made a documentary in film form that is easy to follow by anybody who does not have the time or perhaps the ability to read the authoritative books recently produced by Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty such as <i>The Price of Inequality<\/i>.

They are at breaking point in terms of their health and even their very lives.  It is disgraceful that such a Bill is not at the top of the list of legislation.  David McWilliams correctly shows that the top 5% in terms of wealth own half of the wealth of the country and that the top 20% own 80% of it.  The bottom 20% own only 0.26%.  That is the reality.  That is very different from what people think - they think the top 20% own 60%.  The ideal, in a poll of 1,000 people, was that the top 20% should own about 30%.  The Government has done nothing to address these realities.  It is timid.

The fact that a garda has laid down his life while selflessly protecting the community is a cause of great sadness.  I know that all Deputies join me in extending sincere condolences to the family of Garda Anthony Golden, his friends and colleagues in Omeath Garda station and the entire Louth division and all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is a very difficult time for all of the family and his colleagues and I know that the thoughts and prayers of the people of Ireland are with them.  Of course, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all of us will see what lessons can be learned from last Sunday evening&rsquo;s dreadful events in the light of the full Garda investigation into them.  For now one thing is crystal clear: Garda Golden behaved in an exemplary manner in trying to protect the community and the nation mourns him.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday I announced details of the 2016 Estimates for the justice and equality sector, including the provision of an additional &euro;89 million in current expenditure for the sector in budget 2016.  In total, &euro;2.264 billion in current expenditure and &euro;130 million in capital expenditure will be provided in 2016 across the justice group of Votes.  This budget allocation for the justice sector will help garda&iacute; to tackle crime and support vital reforms and development in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and across a range of agencies.<\/p>  <p>  The total allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016 will be &euro;1.5 billion, which includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding.   More importantly, this funding will allow the recruitment of 600 new garda&iacute; in 2016, in addition to the 550 recruited since September 2014.  The ongoing recruitment of new garda&iacute; is crucial for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and also for the safety of communities throughout Ireland.  The Government reopened the Garda College in Templemore in 2014.  It was effectively closed by the previous Government in 2009.  With this budget allocation we are delivering on our promise to ensure it will not close again.  I said there would be ongoing continuous recruitment and the Government has provided the funding to allow that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I point out that the additional recruitment and budget allocation for surveillance and special operations builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles, as well as recent announcements.  It is worth recalling that since 2012 the Government has invested &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles; 370 new vehicles have come on stream since the start of this year; &euro;46 million has been allocated in the Government&rsquo;s capital framework 2016-21 for the provision of new Garda vehicles; and &euro;700,000 was recently allocated for the purchase of specialist vehicles to support garda&iacute; in tackling highly mobile gangs.<\/p><p>Criminal gangs change their methods.  We must ensure we have a police force capable of responding to the new challenge, threats and methods these criminals gangs employ.  Up to &euro;1.75 million was recently allocated for the upgrade of the Garda air surveillance unit, another important tool, to interrupt the work of criminal gangs and deal effectively with them.<\/p> <p> An additional &euro;205 million has been allocated in the Government&rsquo;s capital framework for the development of Garda technology and information and communications technology, ICT, systems.  The Garda Inspectorate's report highlighted the need for this last year and we are now putting in place the type of ICT needed to respond effectively.  I have announced extra funding for additional civilian experts to be recruited to develop and roll out this ICT investment programme.<\/p> <p> I am working with the Garda Commissioner who will be announcing new initiatives to deal with crime and burglaries in urban and rural areas.  Funding has been provided in the budget for these initiatives.  Grants are being doubled for crime prevention measures to support Community Alert and Crimestoppers.  These measures have been effective so far and will have their total allocation doubled to &euro;397,000 in 2016.<\/p> <p> Deputies will welcome the 21% increase in funding to be provided for the Victims of Crime Office, which will bring its total budget to almost &euro;1.5 million in 2016.  Funding for Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, will increase from &euro;1.9 million to &euro;2.4 million.  It will aid Cosc in its efforts to combat domestic violence by reaching out to victims to ensure nobody suffers in silence.  A new national strategy to deal with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be announced shortly.<\/p> <p> The budget includes an additional allocation of &euro;1.3million to recruit additional staff for Forensic Science Ireland to allow for necessary expansion following the forthcoming introduction of the DNA database.<\/p> <p> I welcome the allocation of &euro;109 million for the Courts Service, including an additional provision of over &euro;1.75 million which will allow for additional staffing.  This will support the delivery of an effective courts system and help in reducing court delays which are a current difficulty.<\/p> <p> Legislation is going through the D&aacute;il which will see the establishment of a new independent policing authority, the most radical change in policing since the foundation of the State.  Funding of &euro;2.7 million has been allocated for the establishment of the authority.  I thank Ms Josephine Feehily for agreeing to be the independent chairperson of the new body.  The process of selecting board members is well under way with the Public Appointments Service.<\/p> <p> Over &euro;9 million is being allocated in budget 2016 for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOc, to enable it to deliver its important mandate.  It is important we have an independent complaints mechanism.  GSOC fulfils that role and it is important that it can do so effectively and efficiently.<\/p> <p> The Charities Regulatory Authority will receive an additional allocation of over &euro;1.2 million, bringing its total budget to &euro;2.7 million.  We are in the position to fund these services because we have a stable economy.  If we did not, we would not be able to make the investment in all of these critical and essential areas.  People know that it is important to have an effective functioning Charities Regulatory Authority.  We saw recently, when we had several scandals with charities, how important it was to have that regulatory function.  We now have it and can fund it because we have the stable economy that leads to investment in services.<\/p> <p> Additional staffing for the Probation Service will allow for an increase in its use of supervised community sanctions for first-time and non-violent offenders.  We need to do this to create the places in prison for serious and serial offenders who should be in prison.<\/p> <p> The Legal Aid Board and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will be supported.  Up to &euro;332 million will be available to the Irish Prison Service.  The Department supports the work of the National Women's Council of Ireland which does critical work in the area of equality, reaching out to victims and ensuring the needs of more marginalised groups are addressed.<\/p> <p> Funding needed for the Irish refugee protection programme will be provided.  The Government has been supportive with the initiatives it has taken in this regard.  We will have the Syrian and Eritrean refugees arriving before the end of the year and throughout next year.  Funding has been provided for this purpose.<\/p> <p> The budget delivers on my commitment to ensuring the Garda, as well as the entire justice system, is staffed, supported, resourced and well managed to deliver an effective service for the 21st century and to tackle the realities of crime in communities, both urban and rural.  The budget is important because it points to the recovery that is under way.  While the recovery is fragile, we must ensure it continues through this type of investment.  We know that the best way to ensure it continues is to make work pay and support families.  We have taken many workers out of the universal social charge and minimum wage net.  We are extending free preschool services in order that all children will qualify from the age of three years.  We are introducing a new &euro;550 tax credit for the self-employed, cutting commercial road tax and increasing weekly pension rates by 3%.  This is a good budget for Ireland, all workers, all families and the people.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400043#QQ01400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444839000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>In the past eight years the agrifood sector has been a beacon of light on the dark landscape of recession and crisis.  We are now standing on the crest of enormous new possibilities with the ending of milk quotas.  We can see the bright future this promises in economic growth, the social development of rural areas and jobs for the people.  The beef sector is expanding, with markets opening up all over the world, particularly in China and the United States.  This augurs well for the future of the agriculture industry which will bring enormous benefits to rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Up to &euro;113.8 million will be made available under the forestry programme in 2016.  This will provide for existing premia payments and support the planting of approximately 7,000 ha of new forests.  These new forests, in addition to their eventual value as a raw material for the processing industry, will make an important contribution towards meeting climate emission targets through carbon sequestration and fossil fuel replacement.  The removal of forestry income from the high earners restriction for active foresters and farmers is a significant measure in support of national forestry policy.  This is a progressive move, the benefits of which will be felt long into the future.  Forestry is of major economic importance in rural Ireland, as well as providing social and recreational benefits.  It also plays a significant role environmentally in carbon sequestration, the potential of biomass energy and the preservation of biodiversity and natural habitats.  Up to 12,000 people are employed in the sector which has a significant impact on many areas.  Large areas of marginal land could be used for forestry.  The budget announced yesterday will make it an even more profitable sector in which to be involved.<\/p>  <p>  Food safety is perhaps the most important issue for the sector and a major focus of the work of my Department.<\/p><p>Our high standards provide the platform for all our other opportunities.  An allocation of &euro;83.2 million for food safety and animal and plant health, including &euro;34 million for TB eradication and ongoing brucellosis testing and &euro;5.5 million for animal welfare, is included in the Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2016.<\/p> <p> I am delighted that an additional &euro;1.2 million is being provided in 2016 for the greyhound sector.  This brings total Exchequer funding for greyhound racing to &euro;14.8 million in 2016.  This additional funding should be used to encourage participation in the sport.  I will be asking Bord na gCon to give that money back in prize money to encourage all the small breeders up and down the country to get involved in this business, which has a great future.  It will create approximately 10,000 jobs across rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> The commercial horticulture sector has gained &euro;4.3 million.  This is so important for the development of that sector, which will be able to substitute imports.  Some &euro;12 million has been provided for the organic farming sector.  This sector has enormous growth potential.  On Monday I stood in a supermarket in Germany which wants to get more Irish organic food.  There is huge potential in this area, which is something I welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400044#RR00200","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444839600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The budget announced yesterday represented a key milestone for the country and its citizens.  After many arduous years brought about by the profligacy of the previous Government, the fruits of the hard won economic recovery the Government has delivered have enabled us to plan for the type of social recovery we all want to see so badly.  When I speak of a balanced recovery, I do not speak merely of a recovery spread geographically across the country or one which is merely spread into every economic sector.  I also mean a recovery for every household, cohort and single socioeconomic group.  Yesterday, in that context, I signed an order to increase the rate of the national minimum wage by 50 cent an hour from 1 January.  The Government has accepted the advice of the Low Pay Commission, which I established, and ensured that the employee and employer PRSI issues highlighted by the commission in its report to me in July have been addressed.  By the time this D&aacute;il is dissolved next spring, we will have twice increased the rate of the national minimum wage during the lifetime of the Government, increasing the pay of a full-time worker on the national minimum wage by a cumulative &euro;60 per week or more than &euro;3,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  Job creation continues to be my first priority and that of the Government.  During the crisis, we suffered one of the largest job losses in the advanced industrialised world.  We lost 22% of all full-time jobs over a very short period of time.  However, the creation of 130,000 in just three years and the fall in unemployment to 9.4% from a peak in 2012 of more than 15% really is an incredible turnaround, but that work is far from done and we are committed to reaching full employment by 2018 and to building on that to ensure we have an overall participation rate in the workforce of 70% by 2026.  Alongside this drive towards full employment, I am committed to making work pay.  We have no interest in jobs at any price.  We will not stand over a recovery that is simply a race to the bottom in terms of pay and terms and conditions of employment.<\/p>  <p>  I have reformed industrial relations laws in this country to ensure workers, through their trade unions, have the legal right to collectively bargain with their employers.  Registered employment agreements have been restored and we have introduced a new system of sectoral employment orders.  These systems represent not only an opportunity for the economy to continue to grow at a sustainable rate but also an opportunity to ensure industrial peace and that working people are fairly compensated for their hard work and the contribution they make to their enterprises.  As Minister of State with responsibility for business and employment, I am acutely aware of the need to balance employment protection and job creation, but the bottom line is that workers need and are entitled to decent pay and basic security in their employment.  Neither side wins when employment is insecure and employers are undercut by other firms using exploitative working practices.  That is why the increase in the national minimum wage is such an important expression by the Government of our commitment to low-paid workers.<\/p>  <p>  As a direct result, from 1 January, 120,000 low-paid workers across the economy will see an increase in their pay packets.  For those working full-time, they will see a gross increase of &euro;1,000 a year.  A single person working full-time on the minimum wage will take home an extra &euro;708 per annum, or &euro;14 per week, as a result of the changes announced yesterday to the national minimum wage.  Allied with this introduction on 1 January, we will have adjustments to the universal social charge and PRSI which will ensure they take home that increase.  A married couple with a single income, on the national minimum wage, will see themselves &euro;911 better off per year, which is the equivalent of &euro;18 extra in their pockets every week.  I am very pleased that in budget 2016, we have delivered the increase in the national minimum wage alongside the changes to PRSI and the universal social charge.  We are consistently seeking to make work pay and to ensure work is always a positive option for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400045#SS00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1444839600,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is for a Fianna F&aacute;il Member.

I can tell the Labour Party, in its glorious anonymity, that I remain to this day incredibly embarrassed about my association with it.  I am as embarrassed today as I was the day I quit its ranks.  In December 2012, I voted against budget measures that were nothing less than an attack on those on the lowest incomes in this country.  Families struggling to put food on the table and into the lunch boxes of their children going to school were attacked by the Government in that budget.  The context then was the same as that of today.  I say that because child poverty has increased significantly since the Government entered into office in 2011.  What the Government has done since 2011 is equivalent to the robbing of a woman's umbrella in the midst of a heavy rain shower and then the seeking of credit and gratitude from the public for the sun coming out.  The Government is demanding gratitude from the drenched lady, saying it is sorry for robbing the umbrella.<\/p><p>There have been cuts after cuts, of which only two have been reversed.  Some 40 cuts were initiated by the Labour Party over the course of the period 2011 to 2015 and yet today, we have what constitutes a perverse recollection of the situation over the course of that reference period during which the most draconian attacks took place on the poorest communities in this country.  These attacks have inflicted enormous damage on the social fabric of our society precisely at a time when vulnerable people needed a Government which would protect a threshold of decency and defend them and their views within it. <\/p><p>Yesterday, the Government announced the restoration of the respite care grant.  Fianna F&aacute;il has called for its restoration over the course of the past few years.  However, let us not have Fine Gael or its anonymous colleagues in government crow that this constitutes a reversal of the savage, regressive cuts made in the area of social protection because the vast majority remain untouched.<\/p><p>There were 40 cuts, yet we have members of the anonymous party somersaulting on the plinth saying, &quot;We are back in business.&quot;  It has only reversed two of the 40 cuts.  It is hardly worth the celebration taking place on the plinth.  The statistics do not lie.  CSO figures show that the at-risk-of-poverty rate rose by 14.4% during the reference period of 2009 to 2013.  The level of consistent poverty rose from 4.2% to 8.2%, while the level of deprivation increased in the same reference period from 13% to 31%.  These figures are shocking and a shocking indictment of a Government.  However, instead of feeling any shame, the cause of celebration about being back in business is that the Labour Party has adjusted two of the 40 cuts.  That party now claims to be a social democratic party and is boasting that this is a significant achievement in government.<br\/><br\/>During the general election campaign in 2011 the Taoiseach and the now absent Deputy Eamon Gilmore promised to prioritise disability services.  How hollow that rings when we saw, prior to the recess and a sitting of the D&aacute;il this year, people with profound disabilities camped yet again outside the gates of Leinster House to secure the protection of personal assistants.  They have done it consistently from 2011 through to 2015, yet the Government has repeatedly attacked the capacity of people with disabilities.  It has ensured their participation has been challenged.  I ask it to state why it has failed to advance ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It has failed to advance any human rights cause with respect to the equality of people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>The motto of the Government has been, &quot;yes to equality&quot;, but only for some.  Orwell's <i>Animal Farm<\/i>comes to mind - all are equal but some are more equal than others.  Economic equality or equality that costs the Exchequer a penny will be resisted.  Ultimately, it will be refused and blocked.  Despite the promises made prior to the last general election by the Taoiseach and Deputy Eamon Gilmore, the cause of people with disabilities over the course of the past four years has been horrific.  There is little respite in budget 2016 for people with disabilities.  The &euro;3 increase in pensions does not apply to those in receipt of invalidity pension or blind pension.  People with disabilities saw all of their services eroded in the years from 2011 to 2013.  This is a group that is vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion.  They do not have equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400045#SS00400","speaker":"1188","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444840200,"counter":445,"content":"<p>The Deputy joined the party that cut them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400046#TT00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1444840200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il cut the rate by 8%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400046#TT00300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1444840200,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Why is the Government resisting signing the convention?

We have led in this area and called for its restoration in our pre-budget submission.  There has been no alternative and there is no evidence of one in any line of the proposed budget.  Even the mobility grant has been cut by those on the other side of the Chamber, yet the Government launched an announcement last week on the integration of people into the employment market, without any cognisance being taken of the capacity of somebody to get to work.  It has singled out the most vulnerable people in society, people with disabilities who have been overlooked in the budget.  Much of the infrastructure required by them to lead an independent, equal life and to be brought from the periphery to the centre was dismantled by the Government.  The adaptation grant for people with disabilities to make it possible for them get into a shower was cut by the Minister of State.  That is his legacy.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment of the Government to mental health services is questionable, to say the least.  There has been no mention of mental health services in the budget in the past 48 hours, which is quite telling.  There is no mention of disability or mental health services.  It goes far in telling us what the Government's priorities are and about its type of recovery - leaving people behind.  Its instinct for self-preservation kicks in at the cost of mental health services and the most vulnerable people in society.  The health allocation announced yesterday includes no reference to disability or mental health services.  That is in sharp contrast to the commitments the Government made prior to 2011.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of mental health serices, we have real cause for concern.  Every year since 2011 the Government has broken its commitment to deliver ring-fenced funding of &euro;35 million for the development of a community mental health service, the virtual ward in the community.  It has not happened.  Last year 500 people died by suicide, yet the Government has consistently cut mental health services.  In my home county of Galway there was an underspend of &euro;6 million.  Members opposite smirk at me for raising the cause of disability and mental health services.  How dare they?  They attacked the most vulnerable and the evidence speaks for itself.  In every budget since 2011 and again this year the Government has cut the allocation and underspent.  It failed to recruit 2,500 staff to ensure the transition from acute mental health settings to the community setting would happen.  The crisis is of the Government's making.  There is no mention of mental health services in the documentation produced in the past 48 hours on budget 2016.  That is an indictment of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  At yesterday's press conference there was an exchange between the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and Sara Burke which I wish to read.  Ms Burke said: \"I realise you are kicking to touch a lot on the service plan for details but surely somebody has done the sums ... for example of the &euro;35 million that you have sought but not always gained before, Minister Lynch?\"  The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, the man of the year, intervened and said: \"I don't want to give that yet because it's not decided yet and they are dynamic figures ... we need to actually sit down and work that out.\"  Then the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, interjected to say: \"But it's not that it's not done, it is done.  It's very obviously done; it's just that [we have not done it yet].\"  The Minister said: \"It's within a range.\"  Ms Burke asked, \"Can we get that range?\" and if people could be given it that evening.  He said they could not and that \"We want to make sure they are right.\"  Ms Burke quite frankly asked whether the additional &euro;35 million not spent in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 in current expenditure would be spent on mental health services in 2016.  The Minister of State jumped in to say, \"Yes,\" that there was a commitment to provide &euro;35 million for mental health services.  That was the end of an exchange.  The Minister of State's commitment in her final comment is of little comfort to me because she failed to protect the sum of &euro;35 million in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.<\/p><p>It is the greatest public health crisis of our generation.  More people die by suicide than die on the roads, yet the Minister of State could not give a straight answer.  To be fair to the man of the year, he made a greater attempt to be transparent on the status of the &euro;35 million.  Members opposite can smirk and might think it is funny, but the lack of progress in filling these posts and the lack of transparency on the applications for them point directly to a failure of political will in disability and mental health services.<br\/><br\/>The response to a parliamentary question I put recently in this area demonstrates how poor is the practice and the delivery of services in child and adolescent mental health units.  <br\/><br\/>One mental health issue that has emerged under the Government which overlaps with a core group in society has been the failure to deliver mental health care for people who are homeless.  We all remember Jonathan Corrie, but do we know the name of any of the six people who have died in the meantime?  The Government has successfully managed to normalise the situation because it believes in austerity.  Mental health and homelessness have a very complex relationship in the midst of the housing crisis.  Despite this, we have seen no budgetary provision for mental health or respite care services in the context of what is happening on the streets.  I walked from this Chamber today to the Hibernian Archway and along the way I walked by four homeless people.  I have no doubt that they are not voters and, therefore, do not matter because this is a Government run by focus groups, as we could judge from the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday which stated: &quot;A budget for the voter&quot;.  Mental health and homelessness have a complex, dynamic relationship that seems to have been forgotten by the Government because yesterday's announcement was appalling.  It is appalling to think there was not one provision to deal with homelessness, mental health or disability services.  That will be the legacy of the Government.<br\/><br\/>Alongside that failure, there was no provision made for palliative care for a citizen who knew he or she was going to die.  Where would such a person go to spend his or her last moments?  On what street would he or she choose to die?  In truth, this is a question that bothers me.  It is also bothering all of the homeless agencies, but, nonetheless, there was no provision made in the budget for respite or palliative care services for homeless people.<br\/><br\/>I mention housing and homelessness, great social challenges for this country.  Labour Party Ministers sat at the Cabinet table for four years with the housing portfolio and simply watched this happen, day by painful day.  This crisis has been brewing since 2012, but the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, did nothing about the issue until that man came in.  The Government only finally seemed to notice the problem in our communities and high streets when we stepped over a dead man while walking into work.  His name was Mr. Corrie and he was found 100 m from here.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, took it upon himself to solve this crisis and, at first, it seemed that something might be done, as there were significant announcements.  We were told that the Minister was kicking down and opening doors, that we were going to have a resolution and that no firing pin would be held in.  We were told that the dynamic that would emerge would be unequalled.  Of course, the Minister is not alone in his failure to confront this issue.  His party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, has played her own part.  Despite being advised to do so by organisations such as Threshold and Focus Ireland and by Fr. Peter McVerry, she stubbornly refused to increase rent supplement limits.  The consequences are to be seen in my own home town, where families are sleeping in turf sheds.  That is the result of the Government's policy.  I apologise if I have broken protocol by displaying a photograph, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but it is critically important that we are transparent and close to the truth. The homelessness crisis is not Dublin-centred; it prevails across rural Ireland and is impacting on families.  Children are living in a turf shed for a ninth week.  That is the legacy of the Government.<br\/><br\/>Of course, the Simon Community tells us that we are faced with a situation where 93% of the properties for rent are for figures outside the rent supplement cap.  On the day this was checked, not one property was available to rent in five of the largest cities in the country.  The crisis is quite evident in Dublin and my constituency of Galway East where the Government has abandoned a family to a turf shed.  They have been homeless for nine weeks.  That is what is happening in this country.  Tonight that couple will sleep in a shed and their children will sleep on the floor adjacent to them.  They will sleep there for months while voids are boarded up because the local authorities have been starved of the resources to help the most vulnerable.<br\/><br\/>The budget is final confirmation that the members of the Government have delivered exactly the fabric of what they are - a right-wing Government.  It is long overdue that this has been said to them.  The damage they have done to society, year after year, with budgets that were independently validated as regressive-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400046#TT01400","speaker":"1188","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444840800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>As I remember it, the Deputy voted in favour of a couple of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400047#UU00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1444840800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the truth hurts, which is why Members opposite try to disrupt it.

However, we are determined to give the issue priority.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I already announced a &euro;4 billion social housing strategy earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  Let me provide some of the key figures for the housing spend in the budget.  We have increased the budget by 18%, from &euro;686 million to &euro;811 million.  We are providing an additional &euro;56 million for capital programmes and an increase of &euro;69 million in current spending, a total increase of &euro;125 million.  In addition, &euro;112 million will be provided directly by local authorities.  Some 7,100 housing units will be delivered by 2016 through current and capital spending, including the refurbishment of 1,600 vacant units.  I wish to make it clear that funding is now being provided for the projects submitted by every local authority to the Department.  The funding is available and the challenge now is for local authorities to deliver.  I call on Deputies like Deputy Colm Keaveney and others to ensure local authorities deliver on the projects they have submitted.<\/p>  <p>  Homelessness is a challenge that must be addressed.  An additional &euro;17 million has been included in the budget, giving a total of &euro;70 million, to deal with the homelessness issue.  The Dublin homeless HAP initiative issue is being addressed and interventions are being made to raise the threshold.  This will assist directly those in emergency accommodation.  In order to bridge the supply gap until the sector normalises, we are engaging in a procurement process to deliver 500 modular housing units so as to take people off the streets and out of emergency accommodation.  We will do this until the housing units are built because it takes time for that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  An issue for which I take direct responsibility is that of pyrite, another legacy of the substandard construction sector inherited by the Government in 2011.  I am glad to report that an additional &euro;9 million for pyrite remediation is being provided, bringing the total to &euro;19 million.  This additional funding will afford us the opportunity to ramp up the remediation projects that are under way or in the pipeline.  We will, at last, be able to eradicate the nightmare for those who live in pyrite affected homes.<\/p>  <p>  The budget also provides for an increase for Traveller accommodation.  A provision of &euro;5.5 million in 2016 will support the progression of a range of Traveller specific accommodation schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  A provision of &euro;85 million for regeneration and remedial works demonstrates the Government's continued commitment to target the country's most disadvantaged communities.  <\/p>  <p>  A provision of &euro;17 million will allow for the continued upgrading of social housing stock under the energy efficiency and retrofitting scheme, providing for warmer and more energy efficient homes for thousands of families.  This builds on the progress made in 2014 and 2015.  A further 1,500 vacant units will be refurbished and brought back into productive use.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to private housing grants, funding of &euro;45 million will provide for some 8,500 grants in 2016 which will assist adaptation works to enable older people and people with disabilities to remain living independently in their own homes for longer.  This contradicts directly the contribution made by Deputy Colm Keaveney.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of &euro;17 million for the mortgage to rent scheme will allow for the expansion of the scheme and assist in meeting the Government's commitments on mortgage arrears.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of &euro;76 million for the capital acquisition scheme will ensure a continued focus on meeting the housing needs of vulnerable groups, with some 450 units to be provided for people with specific needs in 2016.  Under the capital scheme for local authority housing, total funding of &euro;180 million for the provision of local authority housing will deliver more than 1,000 new units through a construction and acquisition programme.<\/p>  <p>  Under current programmes, leasing will receive increased funding of &euro;20 million which will allow local authorities to bring approximately 3,000 leased units into operation in 2016.  Under the rental accommodation scheme, funding of &euro;135 million will allow for 1,000 new RAS transfers in 2015.  The funding for the housing assistance payment scheme is being increased by &euro;24.5 million, to a total of &euro;47.7 million, in 2016, in line with the expansion of the scheme.  This will assist an additional 10,000 families to secure suitable accommodation.  The 2016 allocation for the capital loan and subsidy scheme will be used to make loan repayments in respect of projects already delivered or under way.<\/p>  <p>  I have already outlined the allocation of an additional &euro;17 million to address the issue of homelessness.  This will help to ensure the increased demand for homeless services is addressed.  Some &euro;135 million is being provided under the community and rural development programme under the responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Ann Phelan, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP. <\/p>  <p>  All in all, I rebut the contention of those who say the Government is doing nothing about housing.  Substantial funding in the Department's Vote is allocated for housing provision.  The challenge remains, however, and until the private supply increases and until we can address the demand, we need to focus on the gaps and bring local authority projects on side.  In the meantime, the modular housing units will go some way towards addressing the issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that entrepreneurship and the incentive to create jobs is being supported in the budget.  Agriculture, too, is being supported and the transition model for farms will bring new rural economic development.  Many other initiatives such as those on child care are positive.  The budget is positive and will assist the productive sector, working people who have carried the can in the past few years.  It is welcome that they are now being rewarded, albeit in a small way.  The budget builds the pathway to further recovery and sustainable growth.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400048#VV00300","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1444841400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I draw attention to some of the statistics at the time the Government came into office in 2011.  At the time we only had enough money for five months to pay teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; and to try to keep public services on the road.  We had an unemployment rate of 15.5%, which is now down to 9.4%.  The IMF and the troika were here as the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government was walking off the stage, leaving behind it a catastrophe.  We are now creating over 131,000 jobs, which is a remarkable turnaround.  This is a tribute to the resilience of the people.  I thank those Deputies who stayed with us and did not walk away or shirk their responsibility.  They did not shirk the hard work that had to be done to find a solution to help our collapsed economy to recover.  They made the tough decisions and the budget is testament to their hard work and that of the people.  We did not do as the Deputy opposite did.  He ran away and shirked his responsibilities and is now trying to taunt the Government for not delivering on some issues.<\/p>  <p>  In his Budget Statement yesterday afternoon, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, announced &euro;135 million in funding to support the community and rural sector next year.  Some &euro;45 million will be invested in marginalised communities through the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and other supports in 2016.  This is testament to the Government's commitment to this important front-line intervention for those harder to reach in society, including the people mentioned by Deputy Colm Keaveney.  As this new programme continues to develop, the priority will be to focus on ensuring the needs of the most disadvantaged communities are protected through optimising resources at the coalface.  This is in line with a rural economic development zones, REDZ, initiative we launched and to which we committed &euro;4 million.  It forms part of the CEDRA programme for which I have responsibility and which concerns the development of rural economic development zones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015101400048#VV00400","speaker":"964"}]
