Funding was allocated by my Department to Cork local authorities in regard to social housing for the years in question across a range of expenditure subheads.  In some cases, funding was issued on the basis of a distribution of the available national funding across all local authorities.  For example, funding in respect of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability is allocated to all local authorities based on a national budget secured by my Department and drawn down in line with the allocations issued.  In other cases, funding is allocated for a specific project.  For both Cork local authorities, variations in expenditure across the overall capital expenditure programme in 2013 and 2014 range from underexpenditure of 8% to overexpenditure of 42%.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ann Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The overspend was in programmes for upgrading, refurbishment and reinstatement of vacant housing units where both Cork local authorities were in a position to draw down additional funds over and above their allocation in 2014.<\/p><p>There can be a range of issues that give rise either to higher or lower spends against allocations.  My Department officials stay in ongoing contact with their counterparts in the local authorities regarding drawdown levels and may make adjustments where one local authority notifies a potential underspend and another may have capacity and need to spend more.  An underspend in one housing budget line in one particular year does not mean that projects go unfunded.  For example, on social housing construction projects a local authority may anticipate a level of funding drawdown on a project based on anticipated advancement of the project in a particular year.  While funding may be allocated in a particular year for this purpose, it is not unusual, with construction activity, that projects may not progress at the speed anticipated and drawdown may, as a consequence, be less than allocated.  However, as there are contracts to be honoured in respect of construction projects, my Department and the local authorities will provide funding for legitimate construction costs even where they are presented later than anticipated.<\/p><p>Given the variance that can arise with housing spending, the position revealed by the figures does not always tell the full story.  As local authorities are the housing authorities for their areas, however, it is right and proper that responsibility is vested in them to deliver social housing services.  Their performance in that regard is overseen, in the first instance, by the elected members of the respective local authorities.  Social housing is a key priority for this Government and my colleagues, the Minister and Minister of State, Deputies Alan Kelly and Paudie Coffey, both in this House and in the D&aacute;il, regularly address issues relating to the overall national picture for delivery.<\/p><p>Social housing delivery for a particular local authority area should be and is, I have no doubt, a key issue of debate and questioning in the council chambers, in this case in Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  This Government's important local government reform policy, Putting People First - action programme for effective local government, highlighted that a key requirement for an effective and accountable system of local authority governance is the effectiveness of the elected councils in setting policy and rigorously overseeing the performance of their organisations.  For that very good reason, I believe that the possibility of any social housing funding being unspent and returned to the Department should be rigorously overseen by the elected members locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#B00500","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>My question asked for details of what funding was allocated but there were no such details in the Minister of State's reply, with which I am disappointed.

One of these cases involves a woman in her fifties who was resident in council accommodation for over 30 years.  I do not want to identify her due to the very real danger that she may find herself in, and because of the obvious sensitivities.  She found herself in a situation in which she had to leave her home recently after enduring decades of domestic violence.  Due to the impending closure of the emergency accommodation she is now living in, she will find herself homeless two weeks before Christmas.  She will also find herself way down the housing list as a result, even though she has never missed a payment of rent on the council house that she has lived in for more than 30 years.<\/p> <p>Domestic violence affects thousands of people in this country, as the Minister of State will know.  An environment needs to be created to encourage victims to leave the danger they are in.  As many as 207 women have been murdered in Ireland since 1996.  In 2014, Women's Aid heard 595 disclosures of sexual abuse, including 176 disclosures of rape by partners or ex-partners.  Out of all of the contacts to Women's Aid, there were more than 1,600 disclosures of emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse.  It is with this in mind that I ask the Minister of State to outline how cases are prioritised in the system.  I suggest that the Department introduce a verified points-based system to enable those most in need to achieve safe, secure and permanent housing, rather than taking cases by date order, or a separation of lists, which would mean there was a tangible way of measuring need.  Victims deserve protection from domestic violence.  Due to the increasing burden being placed on voluntary organisations, which do a great job in providing emergency accommodation, I ask that the Minister of State consider a new approach to the allocation of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#D00700","speaker":"1208"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Again, I thank the Senator for raising this very serious issue, which unfortunately continues to be a blight on society and has a terrible impact on victims and their families.  It is important to note that housing authorities do not provide or oversee services specifically designed for victims of domestic violence.  Responsibility for the development and provision of services to support victims of domestic abuse rests with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the delivery of such services is managed through the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.<\/p> <p>Victims of domestic violence who seek emergency accommodation from a housing authority are generally placed in temporary accommodation arranged by the council or operated by a voluntary service provider.  It is not necessary for such persons to go on the general housing waiting list to avail of short-term emergency housing.  Such support can be provided where victims of domestic violence meet the homelessness definition set out in the Housing Act 1988, which is not prescriptive and in practice will generally include victims of domestic violence.<\/p> <p>Where victims of domestic violence need continued State support to meet their housing needs, housing authorities are encouraged to work with all service providers to ensure that a victim's housing eligibility and need is assessed in a timely manner.  This assessment is carried out in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, which includes a review of the suitability of the household's current accommodation having regard to a number of considerations, including particular household circumstances or on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.  This provision allows a housing authority to consider victims of domestic violence as having a housing need and allows them to be placed on a housing list where all other criteria are met.<\/p> <p>The allocation of social housing support to qualified households is a matter for individual housing authorities in accordance with their allocation schemes made under section 22 of the 2009 Act.  Each housing authority is required to make an allocation scheme specifying, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households and classes of households on the waiting list.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ann Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Allocation schemes may also contain provisions for exceptional or emergency cases, allowing immediate housing outside of normal waiting list priorities, should circumstances warrant it.<\/p><p>While the allocation of support is a matter for individual local authorities, the 2009 Housing Act provides that the Minister may issue directions to a housing authority regarding the operation of an allocation scheme and the housing authority is required to comply with any such direction.  Using this power, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, issued a direction, which applies until 31 January 2016, to key local authorities requiring them to prioritise homeless and vulnerable households in the allocation of tenancies under their control.  Victims of domestic violence who are considered homeless by the housing authority or who are in accommodation that is considered unsuitable, on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds, and who are qualified for social housing support on or before 1 June 2015 may benefit under this direction.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the current provisions and arrangements provide local authorities with appropriate mechanisms to ensure that sufficient priority is afforded to victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable groups.  In addition to the current provisions, which allow for the adequate prioritisation of victims, my Department is involved in a number of initiatives which support victims.  Under my Department's capital assistance scheme, support may be provided through housing authorities towards approved housing bodies, AHB, costs in providing accommodation for persons that are qualified for social housing supports that may have particular accommodation needs.  There are a number of AHBs which have an emphasis on providing suitable accommodation to victims of domestic violence.  It is a matter for individual housing authorities to prioritise the projects to be advanced under the capital assistance scheme.  Furthermore, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which was established in 2007 as an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality, works to ensure the delivery of a co-ordinated response to issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence across Government.  My Department continues to liaise with Cosc on the development of a second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which should be finalised shortly.  While there is no proposal to redefine victims as a specific category of prioritised housing need, my Department will commit, under this strategy, to develop guidance for housing authorities to ensure effectiveness and consistency in local authority responses for victims of domestic violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#D00800","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

We are not talking about emergency accommodation but about long-term, safe and secure accommodation.  With that in mind and while all of this is welcome, I believe that a national direction should be given in order to have a systematic, joined-up approach.  In addition, some sort of regulated, uniform thinking is required among those allocating housing to assist based solely on need.  This is one category of victims which should absolutely be based on high priority housing need.  Would it be possible, therefore, to get a commitment that there will be some degree of creative thinking nationally, instead of dealing with such problems locally?

In the past year or so we have seen many protests about water charges and so on.  In some cases people were asked to pay an extra &euro;160 when the conservation grant is taken into account.  In some cases the charge was &euro;80.  In many cases there was no charge at all.  Anyway, we have a bigger problem with charges.  The bigger problem is the major increase in car insurance, house insurance and health insurance costs.  This year, many of the costs seem to have gone up by 25%, 30%, 50% or 60% for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  I know of many examples.  I have one example involving house insurance.  A man made a claim for an iPad that broke.  There was an excess on the policy and all he was able to claim was &euro;150, but his insurance policy went up by &euro;300.  When he rang and questioned those responsible, they told him that if he paid back the &euro;150 they would reduce his policy by &euro;300.  They seem to be making it up as they go along.<\/p> <p>This problem arose in 1984 and, as a result, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was set up.  The board last reported in 2004.  At that stage responsibility for those duties was transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Now, it appears nothing is listed on the Department's website indicating that the Department has any responsibility.  There seems to be no monitoring body.  Consequently, these companies are showing no loyalty to their customers.  Although I advise customers to shop around, it seems to be clear that there is a degree of cartelism operating with all the insurance companies.  All of them are guilty of the same thing.<\/p> <p>I am calling on the Minister to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  I will set out two examples for the Minister.  An elderly man telephoned me.  He is 73 years of age and drives a 2003 Ford Fiesta.  The value of the car is &euro;1,000.  He has a 60% no-claims bonus.  He is asked to pay &euro;880 per year.  A lady was on the telephone to me the other day.  Her son drives a small 2002 Audi to bring him to college in Mountbellew every day.  The college is not far enough away for him to get accommodation there.  Last year his insurance policy was &euro;1,400 on the basis of no claims, no penalty points and the car depreciating all the time.  The premium has gone up to &euro;2,648 this year.  That is almost a 90% increase for absolutely no good reason.  I heard from another young person who told me that cars 13 years or older are particularly targeted by the insurance companies.  That is the reason the young man I referred to has had this dramatic increase in his policy.<\/p> <p>We put cars through the national car test.  Either the result of an NCT is of value or it is not.  We have to get clarity on the matter because families are being crippled with these payments.<\/p> <p>There is no evidence to suggest that the reason for these hikes in insurance charges is vast payouts.  In fact, there is &euro;1 billion in the difference between premium income and the published awards.<\/p> <p>My final point relates to the 3% levy that policyholders pay.  It is fine for people who are paying &euro;200 or &euro;300 for car insurance.  They can get away with &euro;6 or &euro;9 per year extra.  However, the young man I made reference to will have to pay an extra &euro;158.88 because of the 3% levy.  As well as re-establishing the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, I call on the Minister to introduce a set fee rather than a set percentage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#F00400","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kelly for raising this matter with me today.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I should clarify that the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, was not originally established by my Department, nor do I have a legal role in that area or the re-establishment of the board.

To that end, I have responsibility for the current agreement with the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  This body was established in 1995, having as its principal role the compensation of victims of road traffic collisions caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  It is regulated under the terms of an agreement with me, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The most recent such agreement is that of 2009.  It is funded by all insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland, which must by law be members of MIBI and contribute to funding the claim in proportion to their market share.<\/p><p>The area for which I have direct responsibility relates to motor insurance costs and the impact they have on road safety, which is my responsibility.  On the broader point the Senator has raised, to which I want to respond, I am aware of the clear trend to which he refers, whereby there have been increases of between one fifth and one third in many premia within the motor insurance market in the last 12 months.  The motor insurance industry itself is pointing to a number of factors that are causing this, such as the frequency and scale of claims and the cost of those claims.  It is also making some observations about the operation of the insurance market and the particular requirement under the solvency II directive from January of next year for insurance companies to increase their capital reserves, which could be a contributory factor in some of the premia to which the Senator refers.<\/p><p>The Central Bank is the regulatory body in respect of all this, but it is only able to issue directions to firms in respect of where they price, how they operate and whether any decisions they make would risk the sustainability of the company as a going concern and then cause further issues for policy-holders.  I have met and engaged with representatives of the insurance industry regarding this matter and I believe the Department of Finance, along with the Central Bank, will be reviewing the circumstances that led up to the issues with Setanta Insurance, which have also been a contributory factor in this matter.  They will then report back to the Minister for Finance to see what can be learned from this and whether anything can be implemented to deal with the matters the Senator is referring to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#F00500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>When I looked for this Commencement debate, I was looking for the re-establishment of the MIAB.

When the new hospital groups were being established - it was not under Deputy Varadkar's leadership but under the leadership of a previous Minister for Health - Waterford was grouped with Cork in a new hospital grouping and we were promised 24-7 cardiology care for the south east to be provided in University Hospital Waterford as part of that new hospital grouping.<\/p><p>We have one catheterisation laboratory, cath lab, which is open five days a week from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. and three interventional cardiologists.  Patients may be treated in emergency circumstances from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., but outside of these hours, if somebody presents as an emergency, although we have 24-7 consultant cover, we do not have the primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, cover and patients are transferred to hospitals in the south and south west for emergency treatment outside of those hours.  On the previous occasion I raised this as a motion in the Seanad, I was told that an extension to the service would require three additional interventional cardiologists or consultant cardiologists, extra support staff and a second cath lab, involving a capital cost of &euro;1.9 million and a revenue cost of approximately &euro;2.7 million.  The Government tells us constantly that the economy is recovering, there is more money and the Exchequer figures are up.  If that is to mean anything to citizens, these are the types of services which should be provided.<\/p><p>Figures reported in the <i>Waterford News and Star<\/i>last week show that Waterford was the sixth busiest cardiology service in the State.  St. James's Hospital in Dublin was the busiest, followed by Cork, the Mater in Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  A number of hospitals see fewer patients but yet have 24-7 emergency cardiology cover and two cath labs.  It is the same old story for Waterford and the south east.  While we have the population of 500,000 and there is clear demand given that it is the sixth busiest cardiology service, we do not have the 24-7 cardiology cover that people feel they deserve and need and which was promised by the previous Minister for Health.<\/p><p>In light of the response I received in August which referred to the cost and the resources that needed to be put in place to have 24-7 cardiology, what is Government policy?

The cath lab at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, performs approximately 40 invasive cardiovascular procedures each week and offers a comprehensive range of invasive and non-invasive diagnostic services.  This includes the insertion of stents, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.  PPCI is undertaken on patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI, heart attacks, which account for approximately 20% of all heart attacks.  It is done in a cath lab by an experienced cardiologist.  The cath lab at UHW is open five days per week from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Patients who require PPCI outside these hours are transferred to Cork University Hospital or to a Dublin hospital.  However, 24-hour, seven-days-a-week consultant medical cover for cardiac patients, and all medical patients, is provided at UHW.<\/p><p>The acute coronary syndrome programme was established in order to standardise the treatment of patients.  The model of care produced by the programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24-7 requirements of the service.  UHW is committed to the progressive extension of the current PPCI service.  Any extension to the service will require significant investment, both capital and revenue.<\/p><p>To provide 24-hour emergency PPCI cover requires, at a minimum, two cath labs on site and a minimum of six interventional cardiologists.  As for any complex acute hospital service, a key criterion for deciding if a 24-hour PPCI service should be provided is whether there is a sufficient volume of appropriate patient activity to ensure the safe provision of the service.  Without sufficient volume of patients or caseload, staff will not be in a position to maintain their skills, and in those circumstances it will not be possible to ensure a safe service with good patient outcomes.  Given that funding for new developments is very limited, it is critically important that the available funds be targeted appropriately.  UHW is a constituent hospital of the south-south west hospital group.  The priority to be afforded to the expansion of the PPCI service in Waterford must first be considered from a hospital group perspective and in respect of the planning for the cardiology needs of the group population.  The development must then be considered in a national context and in light of competing demands for scarce resources.  The issue remains to be considered and prioritised by the HSE, in the development of the strategic plan for the south-south west hospital group.  It is expected that the groups will develop and complete their strategic plans in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#H00400","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The Minister's answer seems to be different from the one I received in May, which seemed to be an outright \"No\".

It is concerning that the Minister said the priority to be afforded must be in the context of the needs and population of the group of which the hospital is a member.  This will worry many people.  One of the concerns the people of Waterford had when we joined the south-south west hospital group with Cork was that what is now UHW was a regional hospital servicing the population of the south east.  If we are now ignoring this population base, we are ignoring the fact that Waterford is the capital, if you like, of the south east, and facility services patients in Wexford, Tipperary, Carlow and Kilkenny, but is seen solely in the context of the population of the hospital group.  It is a clear departure from how services were provided in Waterford in the past, and I am slightly concerned about it.  It remains to be seen what will be in the new plan for 2016.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the facts and figures, the population and the patient throughput in the hospital.

Consideration is being given to extending the existing service in Waterford to 8 p.m.  Such a decision will have to be made in the context of the group's strategic plan.

It was allowed to do so with absolute impunity and was able to get away with it, even though it was suggested by spokespeople in the United Nations that it could be held responsible for war crimes.  In recent months, Israeli forces have killed 71 people, including young babies.  What do we expect the outcome of this to be?  In addition to the killings, it has devastated completely the infrastructure in Palestine.  People can barely survive at present.  Recently I spoke to a medical specialist in Dublin who is from Palestine.  He goes back to visit his family.  He said he has to psych himself up for days before he goes and he must psych himself up again when he comes back.  He said one could not believe what is happening out there.<\/p><p>There is an opportunity for people in Ireland, particularly at Government level, to be more proactive in our response to human rights abuses.  At the end of the day, moderates are being sidelined in this.  One wonders where the great diplomats of the past have gone.  Where are the peacekeepers?  All we are using at present is the language of war and the act of war, and innocent people, as happened in Paris and in so many other cases, are losing their lives.  We will have more of it, because the people doing this cannot be reasoned with, but we can reason with those who are moderate and we must bring the moderates back into the circle.<\/p><p>Ireland must be clear on where it stands with regard to climate change and the environment.  We must think about the economy, but Ireland has always been seen as being particularly friendly towards the environment.  I would say the farming community could take the credit for being the custodians of the environment.  The language we use on this is important, because if we are not seen to be supporting what now seems to be a momentum towards finding a solution, we may find ourselves to some extent being regarded as selfish and not prepared to play our role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#O00300","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I concur absolutely with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s comments on Palestine, the appalling situation there and the lack, it appears, of any move towards a resolution in the interests of the lives of civilians.

It is worrying that the number identified with AIDS this year has increased by comparison with other years.

It is incumbent on our Government to take an independent line on international affairs, as it has always done traditionally.  Specifically, we should be calling for an end to the civil war in Syria rather than for bombing more people, which inevitably results in a high cost in terms of civilian lives.  To realise this, we have only to see the consequences in the form of an upsurge in the number of Syrian refugees.  The refugees are ordinary, decent people.  A significant number of them were, like us, living normal lives but they have been bombed out of their homes or threatened with bombs or murder.  The key to this is ending the civil war in Syria.  I hope that in the ongoing talks in Vienna, in which the so-called great powers, including the Russians, the British and the French - and now the Germans - are getting involved, some resolution will be reached.  The United States and those supporting it in attempting to remove President Assad should change their tactics.  We saw what happened in Iraq when the Americans got rid of Saddam Hussein.  Instead of maintaining the infrastructure that was in place, they destroyed it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Now look what we have.

I compliment Deputy Willie Penrose, who doggedly and, initially, single-handedly fought on this issue.  I and others raised it when the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, was taking the bankruptcy Bill through the House.  I asked repeatedly, on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, why we differed from the UK in this regard and why one could be declared bankrupt after one year in the UK but 12 years here.  It did not make sense and I am glad the Labour Party has seen the error of its ways in this regard and now supports Deputy Penrose's proposals.  I understand the decision has been taken at Cabinet and the Bill will be published next week.  It is important and it is incumbent on the Government to introduce the legislation as quickly as possible.

It is clear from the information I have gleaned from parents that there are a number of discrepancies in enrolment procedures which warrant further scrutiny.  For example, boys and girls attend the same feeder school to the secondary school for the first three years of their schooling life, at which point the boys progress to the boys national school and all is fine and well until it comes to the point when the boys apply to the secondary school of their choice.  They end up at a competitive disadvantage for school places because the girls get priority on account of the fact that their school is designated a feeder school.  A gender bias exists and the impact is even more far-reaching as it is more difficult for the families in question to establish a family precedence of attendance at the school of their choice if they are unlucky enough to have a male student in the family.  One child in particular, whose parents came to my clinic on Monday, lives in the middle of the town but was placed No. 77 on the waiting list, notwithstanding the fact that the student had attended the feeder school from the ages of five to seven.

There is a big problem in the sense that many of the areas where there has been a significant increase in prices since the tax was introduced in 2013 are also at the upper end of the local property tax.  Naturally, the people concerned are fearful of an impending increase in the tax if the revaluation date were to be next year, as originally intended.  However, the Department of Finance conducted a consultation process earlier this year which generated more than 40 submissions that have all been posted on its website in conjunction with a review by Dr. Don Thornhill, which I welcome.  The upshot of that is we should take on board the views of professional valuers and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, and that the property tax should not be based on value alone.  Other factors such as location, size and many other aspects should be taken into account.

School enrolment is not something that should be confined to a Commencement motion.  For some reason it is an issue throughout the State.  This week I have been contacted by three families and I could not understand why, all of a sudden, school enrolment was an issue.  There seems to be some sort of co-ordinated campaign being conducted by some schools not to enrol children or to enforce rules that always existed but were never enforced.  For some political - with a small \"p\" - reasons, this issue has arisen.  It has caused real concern for some parents who have had their child on an enrolment list since their child was six months old.  These parents have now been told the school cannot take their child, even though it is the closest school, and there is the potential that they will have to send their child to a school miles away.  Such situations are unacceptable.  Parents have been told that if they baptise their child, he or she will be allowed to enrol.  That is no way for any republic to treat its children and we need to examine the matter.<\/p> <p>The Government has had five years to deal with the matter.  If the Government were to bring forward legislation to deal with this matter before the election or even before the Christmas recess, we in Sinn F&eacute;in would lend our support.  We are considering tabling our own legislation in the absence of the Government doing so.  School enrolment is an important issue.<\/p> <p>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; because he raised the issue of Syria.  We need to confront what is called ISIS.  We need to confront the fanatical element of people who live in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and all the region.  It is clear to me that ISIS will not be defeated by France, Britain and America dropping bombs on Syria, and many people, quite rightly, feel that such an initiative would make the situation worse.  We need a global strategy to deal with the people who were involved in the brutal acts of terror in Paris and elsewhere.  What we will see if we continue to bomb Syria is more displacement, more refugees and more people being radicalised.  Bombing the region will not solve the problem.  Ireland, because of its position of neutrality and proud track record of peacekeeping, has a clear role to play.  As I said a couple of weeks ago, we do not have to be neutral on such issues.  As a State, we should not be neutral when it comes to fanatics like ISIS.

In the four years since the commencement of the civil war there, 250,000 people have been killed and 12 million displaced, with no sign of the situation abating.<\/p> <p>International peace talks on Syria commenced in Vienna in October and are due to recommence in January.

This is very much to be welcomed and I hope significant progress in building closer relationships and friendships between the two communities North and South of the Border will result following this investment.

We must not let those who are against denominational education and their friends in the media let the Department of Education and Skills hide behind this scare issue about baptism when in fact it is its failure to provide places for children, whatever kind of education they want, that is at fault.<\/p> <p>Finally, I was saddened by both Senator Norris's and Senator Bacik's comments on the abortion ruling in the North of Ireland.  What we are seeing here is the corruption of law, the corruption of the human rights community deciding that some vulnerable human being are outside the pale for human protection.  The lack of consistency was also interesting.  Senator Bacik wants open season, in accordance with the law, on unborn children, while Senator Norris wants it to be okay to contract with vulnerable women for the purchase of their bodies in sex.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In each case there is a failure to see the full picture.

Perhaps it is time for a substantial debate on the matter.  It appears that any time we talk about the politics and the conflict of the Middle East in the House we automatically revert to a position in which Israel is seen at being at the core of all problems, and we need to be balanced in our view of that part of the world.  We need to recognise that the state and the people of Israel have for generations been the victims of the most appalling campaign against them, and we need to reflect upon that.  Obviously, the two-state solution, which I think everybody in this House would support, seems to have faded from the political scene and there needs to be an international engagement to get it back on track.  I fully respect the right of the state of Palestine to exist but I also respect the right of the State of Israel to exist.  It is on the record that there are not only groupings but entire political establishments in the Middle East that want to wipe the state of Israel off the map, and we should not bow to that.<\/p> <p>Finally, I concur with what Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen stated in relation to the earlier comments on the abortion legislation proposals from Northern Ireland.  The Leader has wisely accepted that we should have a more substantive debate here in the early part of next year.  Language is something I want to mention.  Language is not only powerful; it is a very strong weapon.  When we say the easy phrase, \"fatal foetal abnormality,\" we are talking about babies who have a life-limiting or life-threatening condition.  They are human beings.  At least one grouping representing parents who had such babies, who might have lived for a day, a week or a month, attempted to make their views known to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children two years ago but were not allowed to do so.  We need to be sensitive.  There are no such babies as babies with fatal foetal abnormalities.  There are babies with serious, profound, life-threatening and life-limiting conditions, but they are still human beings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#X00400","speaker":"1205"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>To follow on from that, I, on the other hand, quite welcome yesterday's ruling in Northern Ireland.

In light of the importance of the haulage industry to our export-led growth and to ensure that Ireland remains competitive, it was announced in budget 2016 that the rates of commercial motor tax on larger goods vehicles would be reduced.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to those reductions.  The reductions, which will apply to all goods vehicles with an unladen weight exceeding 4,000 kg, will take effect for vehicle licences with a commencement date of 1 January 2016 or later.<\/p> <p>The current structure for goods vehicles has 20 rate bands, ranging from the lowest rate of &euro;92 for electric vehicles to &euro;5,195 annually for the heaviest goods vehicles.  As well as the reduction in rates for all goods vehicles, the rate structure is being simplified.  From January there will be only five bands of motor tax, ranging from the current level of &euro;92 per annum for electric goods vehicles to a top rate of &euro;900 per annum for all goods vehicles in excess of 12,000 kg.  The reductions are tapered from a reduction of &euro;4,295 for the heaviest goods vehicle band to a reduction of &euro;43 annually for vehicles weighing between 4,001 kg and 5,000 kg.  There are no changes to the lowest two bands, which remain at &euro;333 and &euro;420, respectively.<\/p> <p>The change will benefit the owners of some 29,000 goods vehicles.  The higher rates that apply in Ireland by comparison to those in the United Kingdom, along with the introduction of road user charging in that jurisdiction, have cause a distortion and led to comparatively higher costs for Irish-based hauliers.  The changes provided for in the Bill go some way toward redressing the imbalance.<\/p> <p>This is an interim measure pending the replacement of the current basis of taxation for goods vehicles, which is unladen weight.  The system is out of line with the basis of taxation in other countries.  Replacing it with a fairer system of calculation based on gross design vehicle weight is under consideration.<\/p> <p>There are no changes to motor tax rates for any other category of vehicle.  The total cost of the reductions is estimated at &euro;43 million annually.<\/p> <p>The Bill also contains further amendments to the legislation relating to goods vehicles.  On 21 October 2015, a little over a week after the announcement of the budget reductions, a Court of Appeal judgment stated that the practice of weighing an articulated vehicle on the basis of the heaviest unladen trailer was not adequately provided for in law, and that only the mechanically propelled element of the vehicle - what is commonly referred to as the tractor unit - was liable for motor tax.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ann Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The judgment further provided that such vehicles, of which there are more than 10,600 in the fleet, fall to be taxed under paragraph 14D of the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952.  This is the rate for non-agricultural tractors, which attract an annual rate of &euro;333.  Prior to the judgment, paragraph 15 of the Schedule in question, which contains the rates for goods vehicles, applied.<\/p><p>Following receipt of the of the judgment, the necessary technical adjustments to charge motor tax on such vehicles at the tractor rate of &euro;333 have now been made to the national vehicle and driver file.  Rigid goods vehicles continue to pay tax at the goods rate and are not impacted by the Court of Appeal judgment.  The judgment stated that if it is indeed the view of the Oireachtas that the owners of such tractors should pay an excise duty based on the weight of the trailer being hauled by the tractor, new legislation would be required to make that intention clear.  On that basis, the Bill in question contains not only provisions to give effect to the rate changes announced in the budget but also provisions to bring articulated goods vehicles back within the scope of paragraph 15 of the 1952 Act, the goods category.  This is an equitable approach as it means that all goods vehicles, articulated or not, will be treated in the same way for motor tax purposes.<\/p><p>The Bill is relatively short and contains six sections.  Section 1 sets out the definitions contained in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the new rates for goods vehicles to apply to motor tax dates with a commencement of 1 January 2016 or thereafter.<\/p><p>Section 1 of the 1952 Act provides for duties of excise to be charged, levied and paid on mechanically propelled vehicles being used in a public place.  Section 3 of the Bill inserts a new subsection in section 1 of the 1952 Act to provide that, in the case of goods vehicles, a mechanically propelled vehicle means the vehicle inclusive of the additions provided for in the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) (Amendment) Act 1960.  The current additions contained in the 1960 Act refer to a body, a part, a fitting or a receptacle.  Later sections of the Bill will provide for semi-trailers, which are the drawn components of articulated trucks, and trailers to be included as additions.<\/p><p>Section 4(1) excludes tractor units from the non-agricultural tractor category and provides in paragraph 5 of Part 1 of the Schedule to the 1952 Act, which is the goods category, for the unladen weight of goods vehicles to include the additions provided in the Act of 1960.  Section 4(2) provides for the new rates for goods vehicles announced in the budget.  Section 4(3) provides for the insertion of relevant definitions in the Schedule to the 1952 Act and deletes a subparagraph that is no longer of relevance.<\/p><p>Section 5(1) inserts definitions in section 1 of the 1960 Act that are relevant to the amendments being made to that Act.  Section 5(2) provides for semi-trailers and trailers to be included as additions in the 1960 Act.  Section 5(3) provides for semi-trailers and trailers to be included as additions in the enforcement provisions of the 1960 Act.  Section 6 provides for the Short Title.<\/p><p>This is a short Bill with the purpose of giving permanent legal standing to the decreases in motor tax announced in budget 2016.  The additional amendments are intended to bring articulated goods vehicles back into the category under which they had been taxed prior to the Court of Appeal judgment.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#CC00300","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the Bill she has brought before us.  The judgment was that articulated goods vehicles fall to be taxed at the non-agricultural tractor rate of &euro;333 annually.  That might have been how our learned lordships interpreted the law, but the economics of it are that articulated vehicles use lots of roads.  They have a high PCU value, whereby one translates the value of a truck into the equivalent number of cars.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sean D.

If a motorway were used only by cars, no maintenance would be needed.  There is a rational economic case to be made that these trucks should be taxed on foot of these factors.<\/p><p>The explanatory memorandum which the Minister of State has circulated states that according to the judgment there is no statutory basis for the practice of weighing a vehicle with a trailer.  The economic basis is that the weight of the vehicle and trailer is what we must reimburse in our roads budget.  This should include the weight of the truck and the weight of the load.  There are weighbridges outside most large factories in the country.  Regardless of whether there is a statutory basis, people want to know the weight of what goes into the factory and the weight of what comes out.  This has a very sound basis in economics.  We need to relate this, in turn, to the number of vehicles in use.<\/p><p>The so-called juggernaut problem is redefined, as the number of axles a vehicle has can make a substantial difference to its track cost.  A relatively small vehicle with a small number of axles could be doing quite a lot of damage while a large vehicle with a much larger number of axles could be doing relatively little damage.  This must be scientifically worked out.  Undoubtedly, what is on the trailer contributes to the road track cost with regard to the PCU value to which I referred and the infrastructure cost.  When the trailer is laden this is also part of the bill.<\/p><p>What is being attempted here is correct.  Not that we foresaw what would be the result of the court case but we brought to the attention of the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, that changing the basis of the taxation of heavy goods vehicles should have been on the cards for a while.  This is because the issue is not the unladen weight of the vehicle - which has been traditionally used as the basis for the taxation of heavy goods vehicles - but the laden weight per axle and this includes, as the Minister of State said, any trailers.  We cannot allow these to go free or to be taxed at a low rate.<\/p><p>The timing is paradoxical, because on the night of the budget when the reductions were announced, many people in the haulage industry were very pleased with what had happened.  In restating it in the Bill, the Minister of State will surely have their support.  They were very pleased that the gap between their vehicles and vehicles from Northern Ireland was closed by what was done in the budget.  Section 4(2) provides for those rates as announced in the budget and this will be welcome.<\/p><p>The Minister of State said the practice of weighing an articulated vehicle with the heaviest unladen trailer was not adequately provided for in law.  It is part of the cost and it is very sensible.  We want to reward vehicles which do not damage the highway and charge people for the highway cost of having them on those routes.  It is important to do this.<\/p><p>We are building up a haulage industry.  As the Minister of State said, it was at a disadvantage compared to the Northern Ireland hauliers.  Firms which decide not to use hauliers also bear these costs.  What the Government is trying to do via the budget would improve the competitiveness of every company in the country because companies would get a better deal either in respect of their in-house fleets or from the people they hire.  This is why the measure has been warmly welcomed.<\/p><p>The Minister of State also said later sections in the Bill will provide for semi-trailers, which are the drawn components of articulated trucks and trailers, to be included as additions.

As the previous speaker noted, the legislation has been necessary since budget night to ensure the very welcome reduction in tax on motor vehicles of up to &euro;4,000 for some haulage contractors.  It is a heavy reduction that was welcomed on the night by the haulage contractors.  The court ruling of 21 October 2015 dealt with the method by which motor tax rates are calculated for articulated vehicles.  That was traditionally done by referencing the combined weight of the tractor cab and trailer and the court ruled that the trailers could not be regarded as falling within the definition of the mechanically propelled vehicle.  Accordingly, legislation was necessary, as the Minister of State and the previous speaker noted, to comply with the court ruling.  Interim adjustments were made by the national vehicle and driver file and put in place by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when this was first noted.  Legislation is necessary to both restore the prejudgment definitions and taxation systems for articulated vehicles and also to give effect to the budget changes announced on the night.<\/p> <p>As I stated, there were very welcome changes introduced.  Every facet of society in the previous five years saw spending cuts imposed and various taxes implemented.  Relieving taxes in one area is welcome and we have had a year packed with legislation aimed at addressing long-established cuts.  They had been in place for five years really and people expected something back.  This is one action we must take to make it right for the haulage industry and to comply with the court ruling.<\/p> <p>As we are discussing vehicle registration, section 4(2) deals with electrically-propelled vehicles.  The Bill makes provision for a &euro;92 rate in respect of these vehicles.  We will be considering electric cars in future.  This week the Conference of Parties, COP 21, is ongoing and we had a climate change Bill in the House week.  Only 222 electric cars were sold in Ireland last year.  One way of incentivising people to buy electric cars would be to reduce tax further or incentivise the first year of purchase with a tax exemption initiative.  In other European countries, such as Sweden, thousands of electric cars are sold every year.  Ireland is really down at the bottom, with only 222 cars sold in 2014 and a very small number the year before.  I read that from next year the ESB intends to impose charges in respect of people charging cars in public areas.  When one parks one's car in order to do so, a parking charge must also be paid.  We must examine such issues if we are serious about promoting electric cars and reducing CO2 emissions.<\/p> <p>We do not often get the opportunity to speak about the taxing of cars, etc.  One suggestion is to link fuel purchased to tax paid, leading to polluters paying more but the person who leaves the car in the driveway, not adding to CO2 emissions, pays less.  People currently pay less for diesel fuel but we saw what happened with the Volkswagen scandal.  Diesel cars have been found to give out more pollutants than petrol cars.  By 2010, the design of petrol cars had improved but the on-road emissions from diesel cars can be 20 times higher than lab results indicate, so we were getting false information.  Perhaps some of our legislation is based on false legislation elsewhere.  This is a matter which we should consider.  Some other European countries and the EU Commission have noted that the dieselisation of a nation's car fleet leads to costs in terms of hospitalisations, reduced quality of life, lost time at work and premature death.  I know we tax our diesel cars in the same way as petrol cars so it is something to consider, along with the link to a road fuel tax.<\/p> <p>We know garda&iacute; spend time stopping people to inspect tax discs and bringing some of them to court.  Those people might emerge from court and go back on the road without paying a fine.  There are police and courts costs but many fines are not collected.  If tax was linked to fuel, it would streamline the car taxation process, relieving garda&iacute; and the courts from that burden.  In addition, there would be 50% fewer cases in our courts, which would also relieve pressure on the court system.  Our taxation system would also be grounded with an awareness of environmental harm, making a push with transport systems towards greater environmental responsibility.  It is something to look consider, although not in the context of this Bill.  We are discussing taxation and how to tax cars; the issue will emerge again but this is just to put down a marker.  Everybody at COP 21 in Paris is discussing climate change and it would be remiss of me not to say that there should be some changes in this area.  I welcome the changes in the Bill that come on foot of the budget and the court case from October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#FF00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Senator Norris has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#FF00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Five minutes will be quite sufficient.  This legislation comes about partly to comply with a court judgment and I welcome that there will be a reduction in the tax levied on these vehicles because that will put us on a slightly more level playing field in Ireland in the context of the major transport industry.  One of the complaints of the trucking lobby is that fees must be paid on the Continent for travelling through countries.  We have nothing like that here, however, so the field is not level at all.  We are at a serious disadvantage compared with the other European countries.  When this came in, our negotiators were apparently asleep on the job because they failed completely, for example, to negotiate corridors from Dublin to Donegal.  That aspect was left out.<\/p> <p>There are various costs here and putting Irish transport companies on a more level playing field by reducing tax is a good step.  I will take up another subject that was glanced at by Senator Keane, although I do not quite know her view on it.  It is the question of taxation of private motor cars.  I had this argument with a former Deputy, Mr. John Gormley, when he was Minister.  In accordance with Green Party policy, it should be the case that the polluter pays.  In other words, the motor vehicle is not taxed.  Rather, the tax obtains in respect of the petrol or diesel because it is these which pollute the atmosphere.  I speak with some feeling on this and I might as well declare an interest.  I have an old motoring car and it is very lovely.  It is a Jaguar XJ6 sports car with a 3.5 litre engine.  It cost me &euro;5,000 but I have to pay well over &euro;2,000 in tax for it every year.  If I combine that with insurance costs, I almost reach the value of the car before I put it on the road at all.  Most of that car tax does not go anywhere near servicing the requirements of road users.  It is used by the central Government for other Exchequer purposes.  I would very much like to see a situation where the tax on large-engine cars would be reduced in parallel with the value of the car.  My car's value is approximately &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#FF00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Perhaps it could soon be taxed as a vintage car.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#FF00500","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>No, I am afraid that will be another ten years or so.

I drive it down here, which is a mile or so from my house, and I take it to the cathedral on Sunday and then to the club for lunch and that is it - full stop.  I make about two forays to County Laois every year and I take the car.  I will probably give that up fairly soon because I do not understand the new motorways at all.  It seems to be a festoon of roundabouts between Maryborough and Mountrath and I have simply not the slightest clue where I am.  I miss all the old wonderful landmarks.

The Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) Bill 2015 is required for two main reasons.  First, to give full effect to changes to motor tax rates applying to commercial goods vehicles announced in the recent budget and, second, to deal with issues raised in a Court of Appeal judgment which deemed the taxing of articulated vehicles to be without a proper legal basis.  The changes announced in the budget apply to all commercial goods vehicles and will reduce the rate of motor tax for approximately 28,000 vehicles in Ireland.  The reductions are tapered from a reduction of &euro;4,295 for the heaviest goods vehicle band to a reduction of &euro;43 per annum for vehicles weighing between 4,001 kg and 5,000 kg.  The rate structure is also being simplified and will comprise of five bands of motor tax ranging from &euro;92 for electric goods vehicles up to &euro;900 annually for vehicles weighing over 12,000 kg.  Have we considered what the tax on driverless cars in future will be?  Will we even be around when that happens?<\/p><p>There were no changes to motor tax rates for any other type of vehicle.  The changes announced in the budget were given temporary effect by way of a financial resolution on budget night.  The resolution would expire after four months if legislation were not introduced.  A Court of Appeal judgment on 21 October 2015 in DPP <i>v <\/i>Perennial Freight questioned the method by which motor tax rates were calculated for articulated vehicles.  This has traditionally been done by referencing a combined weight of the tractor, cab and trailer but the court ruled that trailers cannot be regarded as falling within the definition of &quot;mechanically-propelled vehicles&quot;.  Accordingly, such vehicles now fall to be treated at the haulage tractor rate and the annual rate is &euro;333.  As the ruling is that no articulated vehicles fall within the goods vehicle category, these vehicles cannot have the new rates applied to them from January as only rigid trucks can now be taxed as goods vehicles.  Amending legislation is required to exclude the vehicles from the haulage tractor category to allow them to be classified under the goods category.<\/p><p>I welcome the news for Irish road hauliers.  I live on the Border and I know there are many businesses that have vehicles which traverse it on a daily basis.  Those businesses could not compete with their Northern counterparts or hauliers from Great Britain who were coming in and receiving jobs local people could not compete for due to tax reasons.  The hauliers campaigned vigorously for many years and the Government listened to them.  They are now more competitive with their Northern Ireland compatriots and with Great Britain.  All hauliers should welcome the Bill.

The Bill is a very technical and necessary one.  I take the opportunity to raise a couple of issues on the overall tax system for vehicles as a whole.  We must ask why garda&iacute; are even monitoring whether people pay their motor tax.  In reality, checkpoints are a leftover from the 1920s and they are rarely seen in other European countries anymore.  This is partly due to our experience during the Troubles I believe.  Surely, toll roads and CCTV can be used to monitor tax compliance.  Why do we need to use vital Garda resources to monitor tax, which is a civil matter?  Do people think garda&iacute; signed up to stand at the side of the road to check tax discs on car windscreens?  I think not.  The United Kingdom has done away with tax discs completely after 93 years.  They had tax discs for 93 years but last year they did away with them and moved to an electronic system, which is much more sensible.  Rather than the visual check the tax disc made possible, the UK authorities now use number plate recognition cameras to see if a vehicle has been taxed.  Since the system was introduced, the UK authorities have raised 50% more cases against untaxed cars.  It is clear that a aarda at a checkpoint is not able to check as many cars as a camera on a motorway.  Our system appears - and is - antiquated.  Is it possible to look at ways to modernise the system?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Feargal Quinn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would like to know if it is possible to look at ways to modernise the system.  All of this should be done online now.  The availability of technology means there is little reason for tax discs to be sent in the post.  More importantly, garda&iacute; should not have to physically stand at the side of the road to check tax matters.  It should be possible for such checks to be done by means of automated cameras, as is the case in other EU countries.  We need to think about freeing up Garda resources to tackle rural crime, which is a big problem.  We are making expensive tax collectors of garda&iacute; by making them stand at the side of the road.  I would like to go beyond that.  We should look at collecting tax in a much more efficient manner.  In most countries, there is either motor tax or toll roads but not both.  I think it is nonsensical that for some reason we have both motor tax and toll roads.  Why do we need a massive system of motor tax administration that involves motor tax offices, Garda monitoring, sending out tax discs, court appearances, filling out forms in Garda stations and so on?  There has to be a better way.  I am impressed by the system used in Switzerland, to take one example.  I did not know until I discovered it recently that there are no toll roads in that country.  Anyone who wants to use a Swiss motorway must buy a <i>vignette<\/i>, or sticker, which costs approximately &euro;40 a year and can be purchased at any petrol station.  All foreign visitors to Switzerland must purchase one also.  Fines of approximately &euro;200 are imposed in cases of non-compliance.  If we have foreign cars using our roads, surely they should pay &euro;40 based on the Swiss model.  Such a contribution would bring more money into our coffers and help to reduce costs for Irish motorists.  Does the Minister of State have any views on this?  Could the Government undertake a cost-benefit analysis of such a system of fair usage?  I do not expect that to be done tomorrow, but I believe it should be possible for such an analysis to be done.  The very idea of toll roads is a dated one.  Like the turnpikes of the 19th century, some of the modern-day tolls merely serve to slow people on their journeys.  We should consider the Swiss model.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners collect income tax, the universal social charge, capital gains tax and corporation tax.  Local authorities collect commercial rates, business improvement tax, district taxes and levies and the non-principal private residence tax.  The motor taxation office collects motor tax.  An Post collects television and dog licence fees.  I am not sure whether the dog licence is still around.  I cannot believe it is worthwhile.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board collects the residential landlord tax.  In France, for example, rates are collected with electricity bills.  In addition, people who do not have television sets must opt out of the licensing system rather than opting in.  Perhaps we should examine the French system, because it seems to be much more efficient.  This matter needs much more discussion.  There is so much potential here.  I have mentioned some innovative ideas in the area of motor tax and taxation in general.  It is possible for us as a nation to take care of them.  If we were to do so, I think we would benefit from it as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#GG00500","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I remind the House that we are scheduled to complete all Stages of this Bill by 5.45 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#HH00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I will respond to the most pertinent of the wide-ranging and interesting contributions that were made, which give rise to much thought.<\/p> <p>I assure Senator Barrett that it is recognised that unladen weight is not a satisfactory basis for motor tax.  It is open to manipulation and it is out of line with the basis of taxation of commercial vehicles in other countries, which is generally based on gross design vehicle weight.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has established an interdepartmental working group to consider issues relating to the Irish haulage industry.  In addition to the reduction in motor tax that has just been announced, the haulage industry is seeking a change in the basis of taxation from unladen to gross design vehicle weight and the introduction of road user charging.  The group issued a consultation paper late last year to canvass the views of hauliers and other stakeholders on the options for reform of the commercial vehicle motor tax regime.  Following consideration of these submissions, the group is to furnish a report containing recommendations on the future structure of commercial tax to the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Finance, and the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Any changes to the current structure will be considered in that context.  It will be necessary to make amendments to primary legislation and technical modifications to the national vehicle and driver file.  The likely date for implementation is from January 2018.  The working group is also considering the feasibility of establishing and operating a road user charging system here.  Given the technological requirements required to underpin a charging system, its introduction is a medium-term to long-term objective.<\/p> <p>I note the comments that were made regarding electric vehicles.  In budget 2013, a new band of &euro;120 was introduced for electric vehicles with zero emissions.  The rate for pre-2008 electric vehicles was reduced at the same time from &euro;157 to &euro;120.<\/p> <p>I also note what was said about the polluter pays principle.  There are no plans to replace the current system of motor tax with an additional tax on motor fuel.  Motor tax receipts for 2014 were in the order of &euro;1.159 billion.  Maintenance of the tax base would require an increase in fuel excise rates of at least 20 cent per litre, which would have direct negative impacts on the rate of inflation and on economic competitiveness.  Goods vehicles and other high-usage and high-mileage vehicles such as public service vehicles and buses would have higher costs under a pay-as-you-drive system.  There would be other distributional effects, including on those with longer distances to commute.  A significant increase in fuel duty would lead to an increase in cross-Border fuel purchasing, which would further depress the tax base and require a compensatory adjustment, either through further increases in fuel prices or elsewhere in the tax system, to make up the shortfall.  The potential for an increase in fuel laundering is also clear.   The benefits of a fuel-based tax would have to be weighed against these issues and many others before the change that has been proposed could be contemplated.  In recognition of the lower average motor tax that is paid in respect of vehicles taxed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions by comparison with pre-2008 vehicles, differential increases have been applied in recent budgets with a view to rebalancing the tax base while retaining the environmental incentive to purchase more environmentally friendly vehicles.  The percentage increase in motor tax for passenger vehicles taxed on engine capacity was 7.5% in budgets of 2012 and 2013.  This compares with average increases of 25.5% in budget 2012 and 19.8% in budget 2013 for vehicles taxed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions.  Any future changes to motor tax rates will be considered in the context of future budgets.<\/p> <p>I note Senator Quinn's comments about the abolition of tax discs.  Enforcement of motor tax, insurance and roadworthiness obligations and the instruments used to facilitate enforcement measures, including the application of number plate recognition technology, are matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Any change in the requirement to display on vehicle windscreens the discs mentioned by the Senator would need to be considered in the context of the application of number plate technology by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na generally, in order to ensure adequate enforcement levels are maintained.  The abolition of the paper tax disc in the UK since the beginning of October 2014 was enabled by greater use of automatic number plate recognition in that jurisdiction, which allows the authorities there to pursue the non-payment of tax.  There are no plans currently to implement a similar proposal here.

The decision on the compensation fund was taken by the previous Minister and he took that decision for very good reasons.  When the Bill was published originally, some of the detail of the work had clearly not been done.  I have had a huge amount of detailed work to do in regard to the filling out of the various provisions of the Bill.  The majority of the amendments I have tabled today have to do with the fact we now have an independent inspection and disciplinary oversight from the regulatory authority, and they also deal with the transitional issues, with the new disciplinary tribunal body and with various other issues on which none of the detailed work had been done.  That is what I have been doing primarily.<\/p><p>In regard to the point raised by the Senator, this is not about the Bar Council but about the Law Society.  It is about the compensation because barristers do not hold clients' moneys at present.  The decision was taken that the compensation fund, in all its complexity, which has been handled by the Law Society for many decades would continue to be handled by the Law Society and that the State would not be liable in any way for that type of compensation should it arise.  What we are doing is protective of the State.  The key point is that the legal services regulatory authority, LSRA, still has complete oversight.  There is a new independent regulatory authority which has oversight.  There is also provision for people to sit on the committee.  I will deal with that section later.  This was a decision that was taken at an earlier point in the development of the Bill.  I think it is an appropriate decision.  If one were to move the compensation fund with all its complexities, involvement and management, one would be talking about a different sort of body.  We are talking about an oversight body that has approximately 40 staff.  If one were to move everything that is currently handled by the Law Society and the Bar Council, one would be talking about a different body taking over all that detailed work and the liability issues that arise.  The purpose of section 50 is to take out what was in the original published Bill.  However, there has been a journey in relation to it since.  The reason it is being left with the Law Society is well founded.  There is still the independent regulation in terms of financial activities, standards and monitoring of the various complex issues that can arise in regard to compensation.<\/p><p>In regard to the Senator's point about the Bar Council and comments that have been made about it, I have explained that I was given very strong advice on this issue and the constitutional difficulties that would arise due to forcing membership on a particular body.  That is the reality of the advice I was given and the Government has decided it wants to see the legal services regulatory authority established rather than being tied up in potential constitutional issues that would undermine the whole legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#PP00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1448980200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 51 to 55, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

That is in amendment No. 54.  Government amendment No. 51 makes additional provision to the section.  It does this to make clear that all configurations of a legal partnership between barristers or solicitors must be compliant with the Bill and have the requisite professional indemnity insurance in place.

To include things that speculate about practices where solicitors and barristers will happily combine together in a legal practice is to a certain extent a bit of pie in the sky if they are going to be subject to this sanction from the Bar Council.

The Bills Office did so to make it clearer what was happening with these amendments.<\/p> <p>If I could make a point which might be helpful to the discussion about the various changes in the Bill.  The Senator commented on the number of amendments in relation to one page.  That was a reference point for a large number of amendments that were made by the House on Committee Stage on the subject of complaints.  It is a virtual page number to allow for the insertion of the various amendments that had been made but it was not changing any of those amendments.  It was literally just providing a place where those amendments were going into the Bill that had been agreed on Committee Stage so it was not actually amendments to one page.<\/p> <p>A huge number of the amendments I am bringing in here are to do with the drafters.  It was always going to be necessary at this point in the Bill to look at the overall development of the Bill and the kind of changes made and see how it all stood together.  Many of the changes in these amendments are genuine, as Senators will see when they look at the amendments.  We are not brining in any policy changes.  The policy discussion we have had, both on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, is very much the drafters looking over the Bill as a whole.  I appreciate that there are many amendments.  The drafters have looked over them and effectively made the technical changes and the minor corrections that are needed for the Bill to flow as a whole.  I apologise that there are so many of them but it is very much the drafters looking at the Bill as a whole and making the various changes.  I accept that it is a complex and large Bill with many amendments.  These ones we are discussing at this point are very much the technical ones about the numbering changes where one puts the amendments in and so forth.<\/p> <p>I have detailed notes which I am happy to share on some of the other amendments that have to do with inserting monitoring elements, for example, which we will deal with in the Bill at a later stage, and some of the other key points about transitions and the kind of periods of transition we are putting into the Bill when we move from the Bar Council and the Law Society of Ireland to the LSRA.

The substantive amendment in this group provides that an appeal of the outcome of a complaint of inadequate services or excessive costs shall be via a review committee to the High Court.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 88 replaces subsection (1).  The intention is that the authority will, in every case where the matter at hand relates to inadequate services or where the review committee has remitted a complaint to the authority, invite the parties to seek to resolve the matter by informal means.  The subsection removes the requirement that the authority should form an opinion as to whether the matter is suitable for resolution by informal means, which it was felt was too subjective.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Amendments Nos. 90 to 101 and 113 to 118 relate to the resolution and review of the complaints sections.  The intention behind the amendments now being proposed is to make clear how procedures regarding the resolution of complaints will operate and to better define the role of the review committee.  Amendment No. 90 makes a change to one of the options available to the new review committee to be established under section 53 of the Bill, as inserted by amendment No. 63 of the Committee Stage amendments.  The option that the review committee had - that is, to find that a complaint was not well founded - is being replaced by an option to remit the complaint to the committee with such direction as the review committee considers appropriate.  It provides that a remittance can be for a complaint against either inadequate service or excessive costs.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 92 inserts an important new section into the Bill which will enable a party to appeal to the High Court against a decision of the review committee.  Subsection 1 provides that the party, within 21 days of a notification from the review committee, may appeal to the High Court for an order to rescind or vary the determination of the review committee.  Subsection 2 makes it clear, however, that if no such appeal is made within the 21 days, the determination of the review committee is absolutely binding on the parties.  Subsection 3 gives the authority the right to have an appeal dismissed if it considers that the appeal has only been made to delay the conclusion of the complaint.  Subsection 4 provides that a failure by a legal practitioner to comply with the determination of the review committee will constitute an offence under the Act. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 93 proposes a new subsection which makes it clear that where there is an admissible complaint which, if proven, would constitute misconduct, the authority should invite the complainant and legal practitioner to make efforts to resolve the matter promptly and in line with guidelines published by the authority.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 94 proposes to replace section 56, which was inserted on Committee Stage, with a different wording, although the thrust of the section remains the same - that agreement by a legal practitioner to participate in attempts to resolve an issue is not an admission of liability.  We had some discussion on this on Committee Stage and I think these amendments were welcomed.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 101 relates to the procedures that the authority must carry out in dealing with complaints.  I have decided that there needs to be a clear statement that a complaint about an act or omission which could constitute misconduct, if not resolved by informal means, will be passed to the complaints committee for consideration. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 113 involves the deletion of subsection 14.  This is about improving the case management of complaints.  Under subsection 14, the divisional committee could refer a case back to the authority to see if it could be resolved by informal means.  Having looked at it again, we believe that cases that reach the divisional committee have already been through the process, so we are not referring them back to the authority.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 118 makes it clear that an appeal by a legal practitioner against a determination of a divisional committee will be to the High Court and not to the disciplinary tribunal.  The disciplinary tribunal will have a specific function to investigate certain complaints involving alleged misconduct on the part of legal practitioners.  I am providing that an appeal by a legal practitioner against a determination made or a direction issued by a divisional committee will be by way of application to the High Court.<\/p><p>We also have a subsection that states that in certain circumstances the authority may also appeal to the High Court against determinations or directions of the divisional committee.  The authority may also appeal against a decision by the divisional committee not to refer a complaint to the disciplinary tribunal.  Subsections 3 outlines the orders that the High Court may make on receipt of an appeal under this section.  Effectively, these are refinements to the resolution of inadequate services.  The substantive amendment in this group provides that an appeal on the outcome of a complaint about inadequate services or excessive costs shall be by way of the review committee to the High Court.  It outlines the various stages that complaints of inadequate service or excessive costs go through within the body and how the authority becomes involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#CCC02400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's very detailed explanation of these amendments.  I am interested, however, in her remark that the view of the authority is too subjective.  Despite the fact that the Minister provided for the wording that refers to the view of one of the legal bodies - I cannot remember which - she said before that it was too subjective, yet here it is now popping up.  I am sorry; I will clarify that.  The Minister put in the wording that refers to the authority forming a view of something, yet now she is saying it is too subjective, so there is a bit of a conflict there.<\/p> <p>I welcome the option of appealing to the High Court the determination of the review committee.  I think that is a good thing.  The Minister referred to the fact that during Second Stage, or during an earlier debate on this Bill, we commended the provision that an apology would not constitute an admission of liability.  The tendency of the Bill is to urge the parties towards reconciliation and so on without actually resorting to court procedures, but such recourse to these proceedings to try to reach an accommodation shall not be taken as admission of liability.  That is a good thing because it frees up the system and encourages people to take a course of moderation and to try to sort things out without recourse to the law, which can be extremely expensive.<\/p> <p>I have a query about one of the amendments, but by and large they are good.

Amendment No. 122 is a drafting amendment to eliminate repetition of qualifications for lay membership of the disciplinary tribunal.  The purpose of the amendment is to replace subsection (1) of section 66, which was inserted on Seanad Committee Stage by amendment No. 76.  The subsection (1) which was inserted includes subparagraphs (a) and (b).  Subparagraph (a) carried over the reference to the requirement for ten years practice which was in the published Bill, and my intention is to retain it.  However subparagraph (b) referred to the types of knowledge and expertise which a person must have if he or she is to be appointed a lay chairperson of the disciplinary tribunal.  Since these elements of knowledge and expertise are already set down in Section 65(3) of the Bill, inserted on Committee Stage, as requirements for lay membership of the tribunal, there is no need for them to be repeated here.  The effect of the amendment proposed is thus to delete subparagraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 66, thereby removing the repetition.  I am keeping one part and taking out one other part.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 123 and 125 are consequential amendments arising from the substitution of a new section 62 under amendment No. 118.  Amendment No. 124 substitutes a new subsection (1) within the section dealing with the property of a limited liability partnership regarding the enforcement against it of any debt, obligation or liability.  It is a drafting amendment to ensure that there is no ambiguity as to the access to the property of the partnership to meet the debts of the partnership.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 126 to 129, inclusive, 134 and 139 are technical drafting amendments designed to clarify the meaning of the provisions concerned.  Amendment No. 130 is a consequential amendment arising from the substitution of the new section 62, which provides for appeals to the High Court.  Amendments Nos. 131 and 132 are consequential amendments arising from the deletion of the subsection (8) in amendment No. 130.  Amendments Nos. 135 and 136 have been tabled to change the terminology of the sanctions in the Bill and bring them in line with those already in place in the Solicitors Acts.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 137 has been inserted to make it clear that the sanction to be imposed under subsection (1)(l) will apply only where the misconduct consists of a breach of the solicitors accounts regulations.  This is in line with the sanctions already in place under the Solicitors Acts.  Amendment No. 138 inserts a new sanction into the Bill regarding practising barristers.  The amendment allows the disciplinary tribunal to direct the authority to impose restrictions on the practice of a barrister.  Amendment No. 133 is a consequential, tidy up amendment arising from amendments Nos. 137 and 138.<\/p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 140, the intent behind the new subsections is to ensure that the aggregate amount of fines which can be imposed on a legal practitioner is &euro;15,000 and that the means of the legal practitioner must be taken into account.  I have based this on legal advice from the Attorney General.  If we do not take a legal practitioner&rsquo;s means into account, a fine could be open to challenge in the courts.<\/p> <p>The amendments relate to the operation of the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal and will give greater clarity to the work of the tribunal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#EEE04900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#EEE05000","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned the word \"clarity\".

If the Bill is passed in this manner, it will be full of holes and contradictions and will lead to problems that will require further amendment, perhaps by the next Government.

Amendment No. 135 states, &quot;In page 41, in subsection (1)(a) of the section 72 inserted by amendment 82 at Committee Stage in the Seanad, to delete &ldquo;a reprimand&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an advice&rdquo;.&quot;  It refers to the section which states:<\/p><blockquote>Where, pursuant to the holding of an inquiry under section 71, the Disciplinary Tribunal makes a determination under section 71(9) that there has been misconduct on the part of a legal practitioner and determines that the issue of sanction should be dealt with pursuant to this subsection, the Disciplinary Tribunal may make an order imposing one or more of the following sanctions on the legal practitioner ...<\/blockquote> <p>The first option listed is &quot;a reprimand&quot;.  The amendment will remove this and substitute the term &quot;an advice&quot;.  What is an advice?  It sounds like a very neutral and meaningless term to use.  What does it mean to give an advice to somebody?  Does one advise a person that he or she is behaving badly?  A reprimand is clear.  It means a person has done something wrong and is receiving a smack on the wrist.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not understand why we need to take out the term \"reprimand\" and put in the term \"an advice\". <\/p><p>Further down, the reverse of that is included in subsection (c), where the term \"caution\" is to be removed and the term \"essential\" inserted.  Something that is mild is to be removed and replaced with something that is fairly strong.  It looks to me as if the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  Subsection (a) removes a lot of the point and neutralises it, but in subsection (c) the big guns are brought in.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  I wish to God that somebody would give instruction in plain English.  During the debate on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, I referred to a group of people with mental disabilities.  They said one of the things they wanted was for legislation to be written in a way that they could understand.  I am not sure it is completely beyond the wit of man to make things more comprehensible.  Amendment No. 138 states, \"[W]here the legal practitioner is a practising barrister, a direction to the chief executive of the Authority directing him or her to impose a specified restriction or condition on the legal practitioner in respect of his or her practice as a barrister.\"  I am not quite sure what that means.  Does that mean that the barrister cannot deal with particular kinds of cases?  Does it mean that he or she can give advice but cannot appear in court?  What are the restrictions and what do they consist of?  What does the term \"condition\" mean?  Does it mean a barrister can only do such and such if he or she had previously satisfied some requirements?  <\/p><p>This is fairly vague.  I do not know what a \"specified restriction\" is.  It would be useful to have examples of them or a limited number to give us an idea of what is contemplated by the Bill.  The same applies to the term \"condition\".  I do not really follow what is meant by a condition.  Obviously, the meaning of the word etymologically is that one can only do something if such and such applies or under certain circumstances.  It is not at all clear what is intended.  I would be very grateful if the Minister could elucidate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#EEE05200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>There is a history in terms of how issues have been dealt with by the Law Society or the Bar Council and various approaches have been taken.

These are effectively transitional provisions.<\/p> <p>The situation will be as follows.  Where the Law Society has received a complaint about a solicitor before the commencement of the relevant provisions of this Act then it will process the complaint via its existing mechanisms and applying the provisions of the Solicitors Acts.  Where complaints relating to inadequate services or excessive fees are made in relation to a solicitor on or after the date of commencement of this legislation, even though the complaint relates to an act or omission before commencement, it will be dealt with by the LSRA under the new legislation.  It is really important that all disciplinary issues and complaints will now be dealt with by the LRSA, so there will be a completely independent authority dealing with disciplinary issues or complaints about solicitors or barristers.  That is a central element of this legislation and its importance.<\/p> <p>Where a complaint relates to misconduct, as opposed to inadequate service or excessive fees, and it relates to an act or omission of a solicitor before the commencement of this legislation, it will be dealt with by the new authority but using the old definitions of misconduct from the Solicitors Acts.  This is to protect against a situation in which a misconduct complaint about a solicitor regarding something that happened before commencement of this Act would be evaluated against a new definition of misconduct.  The new definition cannot be applied retrospectively.<\/p> <p>Where a complaint about a solicitor which relates to an act or omission occurring after the commencement of this legislation is received by the authority, it will be processed by the authority under the provisions of Part 5 of this new legislation.  When the Bill was first published, we had a Part 5 and Part 6 relating to the handling of disciplinary and complaint issues.  They are now all being dealt with under Part 5.<\/p> <p>These transitional provisions are complex and rather elaborate, but they are necessary in order to ensure that all of the necessary legalities are taken care of.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is critical in any legislative regime that covers the misconduct of professionals.  We are talking here about potential misconduct by solicitors and barristers.<\/p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 158, which inserts a new section 82 is to provide for what happens regarding the handling of complaints concerning barristers in the changeover from the existing complaints regime operated by the Bar Council and partly by the Honourable Society of King's Inns to the new regime, which, as I have said, will be operated fully by the legal services regulatory authority.  The transitional provisions concerning barristers are slightly different from those concerning solicitors.  This is because complaints regarding solicitors are currently dealt with by the Law Society.  The process is currently under a statutory regime set out in the Solicitors Acts.  Senators will be aware that five Solicitors Acts have been passed to date.<\/p><p>At present, complaints regarding barristers are handled under the rules of the Bar Council and involve the Honourable Society of King's Inns where recommendations are required to be made regarding serious misconduct leading to disbarment of the barrister, which is handled by the benchers of the society under its rules and long-standing common law.  To this extent, by contrast with the regime for solicitors, we have no reference point before the commencement of the new Act for a definition of barrister misconduct.  The authority, therefore, cannot deal with complaints about barristers' acts or omissions that will have occurred before the commencement of our new Act.  Such complaints will continue to be handled under the existing Bar Council regime, where applicable, and the processes of the Honourable Society of King's Inns where relevant.<\/p><p>The transitional provisions concerning complaints about barristers will be as follows.  Disbarment by the benchers of the Honourable Society of King's Inns in respect of pre-commencement misconduct of a barrister will be required to be notified by the society to the new authority, and the new authority will bring the matter before the High Court.  The High Court will, after due process, make an order either striking the name off the authority's roll of practising barristers or imposing another sanction, as appropriate.  All other cases, that is, cases regarding a complaint regarding an act or omission of a barrister after the commencement of the legislation, will be dealt with by the new authority.<\/p><p>With regard to both solicitors and barristers, these are necessary transitional provisions.  Older cases will be dealt with through the system fairly quickly leading to a situation where everything will be dealt with by the new authority.  As I stated, there are different transitional provisions for solicitors and barristers, and that is because, up to now, solicitors have been dealing with these complaints under the Solicitors Acts whereas barristers have been dealing with misconduct internally, thus requiring a slightly different process.  However, both processes require new sections to spell out quite clearly the transitional provisions as we move towards the new legal services regulatory authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#OOO00700","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 157, my complaint is not so much on the propriety of the proposal but on another matter.

Senator O'Donovan, whose point I understand, should note this is why I have had to make an amendment on Report Stage.  We had thought we would be in a position to deal with the two professions in a similar way but it was felt, on having sought further legal advice, that I should insert a new section allowing, at the transitional stage, for different means of handling of both.  The solicitors previously disbarred members of their profession under statute while the barristers did not.  As I stated when going into the details, since disbarment of barristers will have been carried out informally in-house before the commencement of this Act, we will not really have a reference point regarding how cases will have been dealt with.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The recommendation is that before the commencement of this new Act for a definition of barristers&rsquo; misconduct - we have no reference point for that definition - the authority thus cannot deal with complaints about barristers acts or omissions which occurred before commencement of the new Act.

Part of the oversight role of the new authority in relation to the Law Society's retained functions is the presence of the LRSA monitor at committees where decisions are being made regarding the action to be taken in relation to a solicitor.  <\/p> <p>The role of the monitor will be to attend and observe.  It is provided that the authority may request reports from the monitor from time to time in relation to the performance of their functions.  The new authority is also empowered under the legislation to make recommendations to the Minister for legislative change.  The intention is that any recommendations arising from the monitor's attendance at Law Society committee meetings would feed into these recommendations.  Therefore, this is to ensure that the LRSA has access to what is happening in those committees, can report back, and can make recommendations based on his or her observations of the Law Society's committee meetings in relation to these matters.<\/p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 267, which dovetails with this, is to amend the Solicitors Acts so as to provide in the legislation governing the Law Society that an LRSA monitor may attend and observe at any relevant meeting, and oblige the society to inform the authority of the place and time of any such meeting.  This makes it clear that we now have an independent authority with the power to send somebody to attend meetings of the Law Society at any point in time.  Equally, the Law Society has to tell the LRSA when and where it is having its meetings. <\/p> <p>This inserts a new section 14C into the Solicitors Act 1994, which provides for the presence of a monitor appointed by the LRSA to attend at meetings of Law Society committees which have powers or functions of investigating alleged misconduct by a solicitor.  It mirrors the power to appoint such a monitor which has been inserted into the Legal Services Regulation Bill by amendment No. 159.<\/p> <p>Senators will recall that a key part of the strategy, which involves the retention of certain solicitors' oversight and misconduct issues by the society, is that the operation of these functions will be subject to oversight by the new authority.  One of the key components of the oversight is that we have this monitoring arrangement and engagement in a practical way between the LRSA and the committees of the Law Society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120100002#RRR00800","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1448980200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I take it that we are reliant on section 14C of the 1994 Act for a definition of \"monitor\", because I do not see one at any point in the Bill.
