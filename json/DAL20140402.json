First, I have nothing to offer and in any negotiation there must something offered in order to get something in return.  I have nothing I want to give the companies in question.  I spoke to my Portuguese colleague and what has happened there is quite different.  The country had a system of shadow tolls, with the Portuguese Government paying the toll for the driver.

I do not intend to introduce any new tolling points anywhere in the country during my term of office.

I have consistently sought to work with the industry to ensure\u00a0it is fit for purpose.

I\u00a0have had extensive discussions with my UK and Northern Ireland counterparts on the matter and have made representations to the UK authorities to exempt certain significant sections of Northern Ireland's road infrastructure from the levy.  Departmental officials and I are committed to pursuing this issue to the fullest possible extent.  In this regard I acknowledge the\u00a0co-operative role that Mark Durcan, the Northern Ireland Minister for the Environment, has taken on this matter.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach raised this issue at his recent meeting with UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, and I understand that yesterday Deputy McHugh met the Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, on this issue also.  My colleague Jim Higgins, MEP, Ireland's representative on the European Parliament Transport and Tourism Committee, has written to the Commissioner for Transport, Siim Kallas, and the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, Michel Barnier, on the issue and will shortly meet the chairman of the European Parliament Transport and Tourism Committee to discuss the matter.<\/p><p>I encourage Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies to ensure their party colleagues use their good offices in Northern Ireland and in the House of Commons to encourage the British Government to\u00a0accede to\u00a0our position on this matter.<\/p><p> With regard to Deputy McHugh's suggestion, a\u00a0HGV road user charge group was set up across Departments and is due to report by the middle of this year.

I am pleased to report that my officials, the RSA and the Irish Road Haulage Association met to discuss these concerns and they have been satisfactorily dealt with.<\/p><p> I have had consultations with my UK counterpart to discuss cabotage carried out by Irish hauliers in the UK.  Ultimately, the issue is that the British Government is taking a very strict interpretation of EU cabotage rules and that is impacting greatly on the ability of Irish hauliers to operate in the UK.  The current cabotage regulations are too restrictive, inappropriate, anti-competitive and represent undue interference in the free market.  However, while the current regulations are in place, the British Government&rsquo;s enforcement actions, while unwelcome, are legal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200007#E02000","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396430400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues.

It should and could be done but, unfortunately, some of large member states take a protectionist view of this and do not want other countries' hauliers operating in their domestic markets.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p><p>  My Department launched a pilot community involvement scheme, CIS, in 2013 for works on regional and local roads.  The scheme was aimed at works on local roads which would usually only be considered for funding towards the end of a council&rsquo;s road programme after routes with heavier traffic volumes had been dealt with.  This is a voluntary scheme and is based on community contributions in the range of 20% to 50%.<\/p><p>  I allocated more than &euro;2.3 million to a number of local authorities in 2014\u00a0for previously committed CIS schemes.  Following the recent review of the operation of the CIS in 2013, I am pleased to say the findings indicate the pilot scheme proved to be a success.  Overall works with a value of almost &euro;9 million were undertaken at a cost to the State of &euro;6.64 million.  A total of 299 schemes were completed in 2013, resulting in more than 173 km of improved roads.<\/p><p>  Given the success of the scheme in 2013 in making\u00a0available moneys go further, I can confirm that I\u00a0have decided to allocate\u00a0additional funding of &euro;4.5 million to local authorities\u00a0in 2014 for CIS.  This extra funding, combined with the &euro;2.3 million allocated in\u00a02014, could see 170 km of additional road improvements.  The Department will shortly\u00a0contact local authorities seeking applications for funding under the 2014 scheme.<\/p><p>  Separately, I will not be considering a similar pilot for the local improvements scheme, LIS.  I have given local authorities considerable flexibility whereby they may use up to 15% of their discretionary grant, should they wish to do so, towards works on roads that have not been taken in charge.  The local contribution for these schemes is 20% of the total cost of the project.  In excess of &euro;10 million is available in 2014 for\u00a0the LIS should local authorities wish to allocate funds from their discretionary grant to such projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200010#H00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1396431600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the funding for the scheme this year.

The extension of the CIS and the extra injection of funds is something we will be better placed to take up in the coming year.  I agree it is very important the Minister would write to the local authorities as soon as possible to make them aware of this.  The success of last year's project and the positive results in the review mean this makes a lot of sense if one lives on one of these roads.

I ask the Government not to produce any Bills this size again.  Will the Minister of State be accepting any amendments provided by the Opposition?  <\/p><p>  Some of these amendments relate to the amounts of money in respect of which people can act.  There is a significant change that relates specifically to the minimum amount of indebtedness entitling a creditor to petition a company that is wound up and that increases the amount from &euro;1,269 to &euro;10,000.  At the moment, anybody who owes over that initial figure can petition the wind up of a company.  This amount has been increased to &euro;10,000, which will impact unfairly on lower income employees who obviously do not have &euro;10,000 of indebtedness and will render them unable to act.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 169 seeks the insertion of a formula of words which would increase the responsibility of the individuals working within the firm.  The amendment states that:<blockquote>Where a breach of employment law is committed by a body corporate or by a person acting on behalf of a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent, connivance or approval of, or to have been attributable to any neglect on the part of, a person who, when the breach was committed, was a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate or a person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, that person (as well as the body corporate) shall be liable to be proceeded against as if guilty of the breach committed by the body corporate.<\/blockquote>The amendment seeks to do what it says on the tin.  It seeks to hold people to account.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 175 focuses on the issues of preferential creditors in a wind up.  While it appears to broadly reflect the provisions of section 285 of the 1963 Act, the total amount payable to the employee creditor has been increased from &euro;300 to &euro;10,000 in 2014.  In reality, this is very low and we could do with raising it to a higher figure, for example, &euro;40,000, which is just above the average industrial wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200011#J03800","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1396432200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>In respect of the question posed by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n as to whether or not we will take any amendments on board, the amendments are put forward and we respond to them.  We have taken a clear position on them and believe that the legislative process is such that it produces robust legislation.  However, there are some points we can consider for Seanad Stage in the Seanad.  We may look at the court of jurisdiction, which is an area raised by the Deputy in connection with employee issues.<\/p><p>  In response to the amendments put forward as they are grouped, we are not in favour of adopting these amendments.  We must keep reiterating that the Bill is only concerned with company law.  In general terms, company law concerns itself with the fiduciary duties a director owes to the company alone while recognising that a director ought to have regard to the interests of his or her employees.  It would be wholly inappropriate to include the proposed provisions in the Bill.<\/p><p>Legislation governing employee rights should be considered in the context of employment law.  We have stated this several times in the context of other amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies.  By addressing such a matter in a company Bill, the provision is not providing protection for all employees, such as sole traders or those working in partnerships.  <\/p><p> Second, employment law already provides for redress in less cumbersome and costly fora than the High Court.  Third, and equally importantly, it must also be borne in mind that company law must balance the rights of all creditors, many of whom are employers in their own right, in winding-up situations.  I appreciate what the Deputy is attempting to achieve with these proposed amendments but the simple fact is that company law is not the correct vehicle for these ambitions.  Therefore, we are not in favour of these amendments.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 168 suggests that a company may be wound up in court where it owes an employee or a group of employees more than &euro;1,500.  The Bill sets the limit at &euro;10,000, as it was considered that a greater balance and proportionality must be achieved in circumstances where the severe sanction of wind-up is concerned.  The section does not distinguish between an employee and any other creditor.  In the circumstances, any creditor is entitled to issue a letter demanding payment and if, after 21 days, such payment has not been received the creditor is entitled to petition the High Court.  I am sure the Deputies present can appreciate that petitioning the High Court is not a simple or low-cost exercise.  It would have to be questioned whether winding-up is really the most effective way to settle a debt of &euro;1,500.  It must also be borne in mind that there are provisions in both employment and health and safety law, alongside common law remedies, which already provide for the type of situation described.  For example, the Payment of Wages Act 1991 provides more efficient remedies for employees who have not been paid their wages than an attempt to have the company wound up in the High Court, with all of the associated costs.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 169 would fail in substance as prosecutions thereunder would be doomed to fail due to the ambiguity of the phrase &quot;breaches of employment law&quot;.  There is no indication as to what is meant by this.  Such provisions are workable but only in the context of the specific and appropriate enactment, where the transgressions are clearly identified or identifiable.  Finally, the amendment proposes that the separate legal personality of the company would be proceeded against for a transgression of civil law rather than criminal law.  In all of the other circumstances where this phrase is used, as with health and safety legislation, for example, it requires a criminal offence.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 175 suggests that the value of the preferential treatment of employees should be increased to &euro;40,000.  The principal benefactors of section 622 are the employees of the company and the Revenue Commissioners.  The period for which the calculation is based, in the context of employee salaries or wages in respect of services rendered, is four months before an order to wind up, the appointment of a provisional liquidator or a passing of the resolution for the winding up of the company is made.  The sum of &euro;10,000 is considered to offer sufficient protection for employees in these circumstances.  <\/p><p> I understand the Deputy's intention with these amendments.  However, we also need to consider that there are other creditors whose rights must be protected in a winding-up situation.  The Bill seeks to offer a fair balance to all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200011#J03900","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396432800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>In the context of amendment No. 169, the Minister of State pointed out that the transgressions are not identified within the amendment.  If those transgressions were identified in an amendment, would the Minister of State have a change of heart during the course of the debate in the Seanad on this Bill?  I understand that the Minister of State is not seeking to create a body of employment law within this particular Bill.  However, the Bill offers us an opportunity to strengthen employee rights and to ensure that individuals who have been mistreated by unscrupulous employers and companies have an opportunity to hold those companies to account - for reasonable amounts of money - in the wind-up process and elsewhere.  While the Minister of State is correct that an approach to the High Court would be a very unwieldy and difficult activity for an individual to proceed with, the very fact that employees' rights are written in law would encourage most companies to take those rights more seriously.  Therefore, the law in its own right serves as a guideline for the proper functioning of society.

Such companies are greatly helped by their status as unlimited companies.  I am concerned about the use of unlimited holding companies in corporate structures in Ireland and the use of offshore limited companies as shareholders within this structure.  I had hoped some of my concerns in this regard would have been addressed in the Bill.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State will consider some of the following issues.  It is possible to start up an unlimited company in Ireland with shareholders who have limited liability.  If the company is based offshore, the unlimited liability of the company is reduced.  The Government needs to examine this loophole.  Most people assume that in the case of an unlimited company there is no upper limit on the personal liability of its shareholders for the company's debts were it to become insolvent.  There are more than 4,000 companies with unlimited status currently operating in Ireland.  These companies escape the stricter filing and disclosure requirements to which private limited companies are subject.  <\/p><p> The usual filing and disclosure requirements allow a creditor to appraise himself or herself of a company's solvency before commencing trade with it.  Many large corporate structures are, however, using unlimited liability companies with limited shareholder liability by ensuring that some or all of the shareholders are limited liability entities.  They may also reorganise company structures to transfer trade to a limited liability company at a later date.  While it is always open to the courts to look through the corporate character of unlimited companies to determine whether its members include limited companies, in other words to lift the corporate veil to examine the underlying members, it can only be done via an expensive court application.  This general principle was approved by the Supreme Court in the case of Bray Travel Limited but as the High Court remarked recently in the Goode Concrete <i>v.<\/i>CRH case, this approach is not possible when the limited company is an offshore company.  This happens where the subsidiary limited company of an Irish holding company with unlimited status is registered in a country outside the EU, including the Isle of Man, which has limited disclosure requirements.<\/p><p> A number of large companies which previously operated in Ireland, in particular in the construction sector, collapsed at enormous cost to the taxpayer, and much more than I cost them.  The people trading with these companies at the time did not understand where they stood because of the level of secrecy around their business affairs.  This could possibly be addressed by way of the introduction of legislation requiring all private unlimited companies to notify the Companies Registration Office of any shareholder company that might limit its liability.  The unlimited company could be required to update information yearly when filing its annual returns or any abridged financial information required.  This would allow a creditor to check the CRO's records of an unlimited company at the outset of contractual negotiations and would alert him or her to the fact that although registered as unlimited, the company's liability may be limited.  Failure of an unlimited company to notify the CRO of any limited liability shareholder could result in the immediate imposition of a limited liability status on the company or in respect of a particular transaction, as the court sees fit within the limits of reasonableness and proportionality.<\/p><p> Transparency could be enhanced by addressing this issue.  I realise that Fine Gael is pro large business but I would expect members of the Labour Party to try to hold them to account in terms of ensuring greater transparency.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say in response to those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200015#N06900","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396435200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>There is not a Minister or Deputy in this House who is not pro-business, be that business small, independent, a sole trader or a transnational corporation.  The vast majority of businesses, whether multinational corporations or sole traders, operate legitimately and with probity in relation to their taxation, employment, health and safety and any other corporates of law one cares to mention.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 242 is made up of four subsections.  Subsection (1) states that an unlimited company shall disclose by the filing of a notification with the Companies Registration Office a list of all members which are limited companies, and their respective number of allocated shares.  The information sought by the amendment is already available on request.  Under 217(9)(<i>c<\/i>) all companies are obliged to allow any person to inspect their members' register on the payment of a fee which must be &euro;10 or less.  Section 217(12)(<i>c<\/i>) obliges companies to send copies of the members' register to any person who requests it, again for a fee of &euro;10 or less.  This register contains the names and addresses of members and the number of shares held by each member.  This also applies to unlimited companies.  <\/p><p>  In relation to subsections (3) and (4) of the amendment, it would be costly to set up a public register of the type set out, in particular in light of the fact that the information is already available by other means.  Currently, there is no requirement to report this information to the CRO.  In this regard, the Deputy referred to the possibility of the introduction of legislation.  The Deputy is free to introduce legislation to this House.  Therefore, there would be costs associated with this for the CRO and the affected companies.  The ongoing cost to the CRO and affected companies of making and processing thousands of notifications would be colossal.  The costs involved in delays to transfer of ownership in shares would be unacceptably and could interfere with the constitutional rights to private property.  That is something we all adhere to also.  <\/p><p>  I am not sure if the Deputy is suggesting that we should remove unlimited companies from Irish law altogether.  Limited companies serve many legitimate business purposes and are a feature of company law across the European Union.  Just as guarantee companies and public limited companies are important for certain types of business, unlimited companies also serve an important purpose.  Removing them would be disproportionate and would, I would argue, put Ireland at a competitive disadvantage.  If the Deputy would like to remove the reporting exemption from unlimited companies, other countries across the EU allow unlimited companies to dispense with reporting requirements.  This is because reporting requirements are imposed as a <i>quid pro quo<\/i> of limited.  Where there is no limited liability there is no reason to require financial reporting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200016#O00200","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1396435200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>As regards the Minister of State's statement that everybody in this House would be pro-business, history will show that austerity and all it entailed was not pro small business.

I believe they should be allowed to operate but we should maximise our efforts to hold them to account.  The Minister of State mentioned that limited companies have to go through the same hoops as unlimited companies.  However, my point is that many of the unlimited companies are not near as unlimited as one would think.  Some are actually limited and have many of the benefits of limited companies without being titled limited.  The Minister of State said that similar systems operate across Europe.  World economists like Ha-Joon Chang and Stiglitz are looking at what is happening in the business world.  They see a race to the bottom in terms of how we operate.  Companies Bills are not introduced very often.  The Bill before us is mammoth.  It will be years before similar legislation is introduced again.<\/p><p>We should maximise our efforts to ensure that these unlimited companies are more transparent in their operations and that they are at least held to account in Ireland.

We could become involved in an argument with regard to the supports available to small and large businesses.  However, as stated in reply to a previous amendment, between 250 and 300 individuals who own small businesses of various sizes attended an event in Cork yesterday in order to learn about the business supports provided by over 27 agencies of the State.  Factually, the Deputy's statement is just not correct.<\/p><p>  In the context of the amendment, the law on unlimited companies is governed by EU directives and any proposed changes to Irish law would produce few, if any, benefits for the creditors of such companies.  However, such changes would give rise to a substantial cost to this country in terms of its international commercial competitiveness.  Ireland is a small island nation and the foreign direct investment sector here is responsible for employing many thousands of people either directly or indirectly, in the context of sub-supply or in the provision of services.  The fact that foreign direct investment companies operate here gives rise to downstream benefits, in terms of supply, for many of the small businesses we are discussing.  I accept the Deputy's concern with regard to the ownership of unlimited companies.  This issue will be dealt with in the coming months in the context of the accounting directive, which is due for transposition in 2015.  The debate relating to said directive is the most suitable avenue for considering the issues raised by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  The primary aim of the Bill before the House is to consolidate and tidy up the existing law.  It is also designed to provide an accessible, user-friendly framework for businesses operating within our shores.

It is fair to say that the letter from the Garda Commission gives a clear sequence of actions, outlines the comprehensive interaction that the Commissioner had with many State agencies - the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Attorney General's office - and references that consultations would need to be held with the Data Protection Commissioner following advices from the Attorney General.  It goes on to assert that the Attorney General advised that an inventory of all of the recordings would be compiled and also that the Commissioner's main concern was as a data controller.  These are all important points because, when one reads the letter, it is difficult to find anything wrong with how the Commissioner responded to the issue, both legally and within his duties, given the comprehensive nature of his response.<\/p><p>  The Secretary General's report is also interesting, but leaves many questions unanswered.

Ian Bailey's solicitor wrote three times in 2012 to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, about the Garda Commissioner's refusal to provide information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Incompetence aside, this refusal, repeated many times, is the real reason for the lack of cohesion in the Government's response to these scandals.  Yesterday's report by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality confirms this.  He said that departmental officials were so preoccupied with the possible ramifications of taped calls at Bandon Garda station that they might not have realised the gravity of more widespread taping of telephone calls over decades.<\/p><p>  Yesterday I asked if the Minister would clarify his position in the debate on the Private Members' motion.

The case has been ongoing for a number of years.  As I said yesterday, the issue became crystalised because the end of the discovery process required a Garda affidavit to send the material to the legal team representing Mr. Bailey.  It is clear from the Secretary General's report that the tapes that became known to officials when they were transcribed and assessed contain material that is very serious indeed.  Those tapes are part of the discovery process and this case is before the courts.  I do not wish to say anything here that would prejudice the outcome of that case, but clearly the material that has been transcribed and assessed and which will more than likely enter the public domain is very stark.  Those tapes are part of the discovery process and are being sent to the legal team to be part of the case before the courts.<\/p><p> In approving the appointment of Mr. Justice Fennelly at its meeting yesterday, the Government made a number of recommendations that will have to be concluded in the terms of reference for the commission in consultation with the Department of Justice and Equality.  Clearly, we need to be able to have, as part of that, the process, background, context, reasons, authorisation, use, retention, and the legality, the illegality or whatever of tape recordings where matters of public concern are involved.  This is a matter of grave public concern and it needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> This is in two parts.  There is the immediate focus on the specific case and there is the wider implication for the trawl which produced evidence of systematic recording of conversations in Garda stations, and their retention, which have to be subject to a protocol if they are to be destroyed, as the Data Protection Commissioner pointed out.  However, as the Deputy is aware, the Attorney General made an order that no tapes be destroyed.  I think that is in the public interest as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200020#S04100","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396437600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's answer is very disappointing because I am not clear whether he is going to include these matters in the commission of investigation, or whether he is going to set up a separate commission of investigation.  The Taoiseach is saying these are highly significant and stark matters.  In the lead in to the Morris tribunal, then Opposition Deputy Alan Shatter rightly tabled a motion here for the required public inquiry into allegations of misconduct by some garda&iacute; in County Donegal.  He expressed disappointment when the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice said that he was going to appoint a lawyer instead to examine all the relevant papers.  At the time of the Morris report, the Minister said the following:<blockquote>These matters should not have been left festering.  The [Fianna F&aacute;il] Minister for Justice kicked essentially to touch... A banana republic would not deal with an issue as serious as this in such a manner.<\/blockquote>I rest my case.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, said that a banana republic would not deal with an issue as serious as this in such a manner, yet he is now the justice Minister.  The Morris tribunal uncovered alarming illegalities, corruption and cover-up by some elements of the Garda, which do not reflect on the vast majority of members of that service.  Mr. Justice Morris was also very clear that the combination of corruption uncovered in Donegal could easily occur elsewhere.  He made that very clear.  In the Bailey case, it could be even worse, because the issues involved are not just local or regional; they go right to the top of the justice system in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister for Justice and Equality, and that is a matter of public record.<\/p><p>  Again, I ask the Taoiseach to be clear in his answer that either he will include these matters in the commission of investigation, or he will set up an appropriate inquiry, which the Minister, Deputy Shatter, argued for in the build up to the Morris tribunal when he was Fine Gael spokesperson, which means a commission of investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200021#T00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1396437600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>When the information was brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality, he informed his colleagues at yesterday's Cabinet meeting in respect of the recordings of prisoners.

It has no costings.  One might suspect that many aspects of it are being deferred until after the local elections.  Obviously, a substantial number of people will either face significant extra taxes or charges arising from it, or will have their existing level of cover restricted or cut back.  Will the Taoiseach facilitate a debate in the House on the White Paper as quickly as possible, given the importance it potentially holds for many people?  There is a need for clarity regarding the taxation issue.  It is inevitable that a sizeable proportion of people will have to pay extra charges.  Ultimately, universal health insurance is no more than a funding model.  Nothing is free at the end of the day.  Someone has to pay for the heath service.  The model of funding is the key issue here.  Now that the White Paper has been published - shallow and all as it is - I believe it should be debated in the House.<\/p><p>  Can the Taoiseach tell us when the health (general practitioner medical service) Bill will be published?  The Bill is necessary if the Government is to follow through on its commitment regarding GP care for those under the age of five.  Will that legislation cover those who continue to have their medical cards taken from them in a random fashion?  The elimination of discretionary medical cards is one of the scandals of this Government.  It has hit hardest those who are sickest.  I refer particularly to children with special needs and multiple conditions and to people with motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis.  When one knocks on doors and people come to one to complain that medical cards have been taken from them in such circumstances, it is difficult to comprehend.  It reflects very badly on the Government.  We need some legislative response to that in the context of the forthcoming Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200022#U04200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1396438200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I will facilitate a discussion in the House on the White Paper.

There has been a long campaign for an ambulance service in north Galway and I was one of several representatives who organised a campaign petitioning to have an ambulance base located in Tuam to serve north Galway-south Mayo.  We expected a 24-hour service but what we received is a day service that is not fully operational.  There is not even a timetable available for the ambulance base.  On the one hand, we are told there is an embargo on recruitment and on the other, we are told that there are staff willing to transfer to Tuam to provide the service and we are still waiting.<\/p><p>  There is a new building in place and people are very anxious to have a service there.  Great work is being done by the Order of Malta but the Minister probably understands that traffic to and from Galway city where the ambulances come from is a huge issue.  We do not have adequate staffing or vehicles, there are over 30,000 people in the catchment area and &euro;2 million has already been spent on the building.  I know other centres are looking for funding but I make the point that trade unions have been fighting the cause of the people and there are very well-qualified personnel.  Many of the staff trained in St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe.  We are still using Galway city as a base even though we have bases in Loughrea and Carraroe in west Galway.  Traffic is a huge issue.  We are waiting for work on the new Gort-Tuam motorway to start.  There seems to be some delay in getting it started.  Given that work has not started, traffic will be a huge issue and there will be delays in Tuam and south Mayo, which we hope will be served by the base.  I hope the Minister can give us some indication as to how the base in Tuam will proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200026#Y00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1396440300,"counter":578,"content":"<p>When I was a Minister, we recognised that the more isolated rural areas were unlikely to ever get an ambulance service adjacent to them.  The Minister would appreciate far more than me the rule about the golden hour.  As a result, we decided to grant aid through the Order of Malta and the Red Cross the purchase of voluntary ambulances.  Local people did all the necessary training up to the standards laid down to become voluntary ambulance workers.  We had a very good ambulance service in places like Carna, Leenane and Clonbur in my own area but also around the country.  We had ambulances in place anywhere a local community was willing to commit to this service.  They were available on call-out.  It meant that times getting to incidents were vastly reduced.<\/p><p>  It was with great shock that I found out recently that the ambulance service of the HSE has claimed that these people who are trained to the national standard and have the qualifications laid down by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council are not considered sufficiently trained to continue to provide this service.  My understanding is that there are four levels of qualified staff - emergency first responder, emergency medical technician, paramedics and advanced paramedics.  I understand that the HSE's argument is that these people are not trained paramedics.  It is strange that they are allowed to attend football matches <i>gratis<\/i> and any other event and that if a person has a heart attack there, there is no problem with putting them in the ambulance.  However, they cannot do a call-out in our area and we must wait for an hour, an hour and a half or two hours for a first call.  An ambulance could be sitting within ten to 15 minutes of the person affected but according to some bizarre rule, they cannot get that ambulance to provide the service.  <\/p><p>  I presume the Minister was not aware of this.  I would not expect him to know every detail of every decision made by the HSE.  However, this issue is worthy of an investigation.  Perhaps in his reply, the Minister could commit to coming back having investigated the basis for this decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200026#Y00400","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1396440300,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I compliment Una Smith and the &quot;Prime Time&quot; team for exposing the reality of what is happening at the coalface in our ambulance service.  We have wonderful staff working in appalling conditions.  I want to bring the Minister back to something he said in the House on 30 June 2011 when he stood up and promised the people of Roscommon that they would have additional ambulances.  He stated:<blockquote>The service was to be supplemented by an additional ambulance so there would be four ambulances covering Roscommon during the day and three at night.  I can guarantee that.  There will be extra paramedics available with a car to provide cover if all the ambulances are out of Roscommon at any given time.  These are services that I can control and which I will deliver.  <\/blockquote>The Minister went on to say that &quot;the abiding message I want to send from this House today is that I want to replace that which is not safe with something that is safe&quot;.  The &quot;Prime Time&quot; report exposed the fact that there has been a complete depletion of all the ambulances in county Roscommon for extended periods of at least two hours on ten out of 14 days that the report analysed.  An expert interviewed on the programme highlighted the fact that too few resources are available to the people of Roscommon to meet their needs.  <\/p><p>  Instead of addressing this issue, the intention is to spread these limited resources over an even wider area with one of the Roscommon town ambulances now to be relocated to Loughglynn to provide a badly needed service to the people of west Roscommon and east Mayo.  We have already seen the loss of one of our ambulances servicing the county in Ballinasloe which has been re-located to Tuam for three days a week.  Yes, we have a great air ambulance service, which is to be welcomed, but people get heart attacks and strokes at night and the only way the ambulance can be called in is if the paramedic calls it.  <\/p><p>  We have three nationally recognised ambulance black spots, all of which happen to be in the west of Ireland - Mulranny in Mayo, Tuam in Galway and west Roscommon-east Mayo.  The Government is spending &euro;1.2 million on the Tuam base, &euro;470,000 on the Mulranny base and &euro;70,000 on the Loughglynn base with no ambulances and no additional staffing being made available to service those stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200026#Y00500","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1396440300,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies opposite.  We covered this area last week in the Chamber and again yesterday at Question Time.  I understand that in different parts of the country, different concerns are raised but I welcome the opportunity to outline again the current position relating to our pre-hospital emergency care services.<\/p><p>The National Ambulance Service, NAS, is working to ensure the provision of high quality and timely emergency pre-hospital care services using all available resources as effectively and as efficiently as possible.  As with any pre-hospital service, development and modernisation is an ongoing process as technology and clinical standards change.  A significant reform programme is under way and additional funding of &euro;3.6 million and 43 staff have been provided in the 2014 national service plan.  I believe it is important that we acknowledge that progress is being made.  <\/p><p> New governance arrangements are being put in place to ensure the timely assessment, diagnosis, initial management and transport of acutely ill patients to appropriate care.  A joint review of Dublin ambulance services, commissioned by Dublin City Council and the HSE, will determine the best model of ambulance services for the city, although I know this does not concern any of the Deputies here.  In addition, an independent review of the NAS capacity nationwide will determine the level and use of resources required in terms of staff, vehicles, skills and distribution, for a safe and effective service now and into the future.  I am confident that the reports of these reviews will inform the development of a modem, clinically-driven system, properly resourced, for appropriate and timely services to the benefit of patients.<\/p><p> Deputy Kitt raises the issue of services in north Galway and south Mayo.  The national capacity review, as well as the HIQA review, will be of importance in the context of the development of services outside the main urban areas and, in particular, the western area which, because of its rural nature and road network, provides a particular challenge for response time targets.  The counties in question benefit from the Emergency Aeromedical Support, EAS, service.  This service provides rapid air transport of seriously ill or injured patients to an acute facility, where the land transit time would not be clinically advisable.  The EAS has completed 556 missions since its inception in June 2012 to February 2014.  The Irish Coast Guard also performed over 300 helicopter missions in support of the NAS in 2013 and will continue to do so in 2014.<\/p><p> I would like to assure the House that the NAS will continue to modernise and reconfigure its services to deliver timely and appropriate emergency pre-hospital care.  The ongoing reform programme will provide a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's commented on the golden hour but things have moved on in that regard.  The critical period now is 90 minutes for somebody with an acute myocardial infarction or a heart attack which requires a bypass, which is now done through stenting.  All patients going to the relevant centres can avail of this and the outcomes have been hugely improved for people who suffer heart attacks.  There have also been huge improvements in the numbers of stroke patients who receive thrombolysis, the blood clot busting agent, which relieves their symptoms, saving at least a life a week and preventing three people per week from going into long-term care.  We have gone from the bottom of the list in Europe for such procedures to the very top in a very short timeframe of 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200026#Y00600","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396440900,"counter":582,"content":"<p>As the Minister said with regard to Tuam, the traffic situation on the Galway Road is very serious and presents a huge challenge when ambulances have to be called from outside the town.

The local ambulance, on the other hand, is run on a voluntary basis by people who work to serve their communities and who have huge dedication.  They are fully qualified and have received training from organisations like the Red Cross and the Order of Malta, which adhere to very high standards.  No explanation has been given as to why they can transport patients who were injured at sports events and so forth but cannot pick people up who need to be brought to hospital.

Bizarrely, we also have the biggest underspend on overtime.

The real issue here, which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v alluded to, is the time to care.  That is why the early responder and pre-hospital emergency care advance paramedics are so important.  That feeds into the Deputy's other concern regarding the Order of Malta and others, who are not trained to deal with people in the same way as the advanced paramedics are trained, which is why they cannot be used in as open a fashion as the Deputy might like.  That is not in any way to denigrate the people concerned and we certainly need to look into the issue raised by the Deputy to determine how we can best use the resources available.  There must be cases which would be suitable for the Order of Malta to transport - patients who are not acutely ill but who, nonetheless, need to go to hospital.  However, I do not think we would want them to be looking after someone who has had an acute heart attack, without the ability to canulate the patient and so forth, or other situations which require the specialist expertise of the advanced paramedic.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the HSE target for carrying vehicles to respond within 19 minutes was 70% for echo calls and 68% for delta calls, both of which are life-threatening.  For 2014, the target for both call types has been increased to 80%.<\/p><p> There has been in excess of a 1,000% per month increase in ambulance call-outs and this has placed a strain on the service.  None the less, they are only 1% and 2% behind those rates this year.  The Government has increased spending on the ambulance service both this year and last year.  While there was a reduction in the number of ambulance vehicles <i>per se<\/i>for carrying patients, there are more of them available to do that job now because we have increased the number of vehicles to transfer patients between hospitals, thus freeing up those as well as the number of cars and motorbikes.<\/p><p> We are making improvements, although I can understand that there is room for more.  We plan to make more improvements as time goes by.  We want people to be reassured that they are able to obtain acute care when they need it.  We fully realise and understand also that there are isolated areas with poor roads that are very difficult to access.  We will continue to strive to achieve that, however.  Mr. Dunne was alluding to the fact that our vehicles are of the highest specification and that our staff are trained to the highest level.  Those matters are important.  The crucial thing is that ambulances can get to the patient who needs them on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200027#Z00500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396441500,"counter":587,"content":"<p>They need to respond at all stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200028#AA00300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","time":1396441500,"counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200028#AA00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1396441500,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I must apologise for my voice which has been affected by some dental work, but I will try to struggle through.  I wish to raise the important issue of the new referral procedure for children in the north side of Dublin to the Mater child and adolescent mental health service.  Mater CAMHS deals with the mental health needs of children aged from birth to 16 in Dublin North-Central.  Sixteen and 17 year olds are also continuing to use the service.  Dublin postcodes 1, 3 and parts of 7, 9, 11 and 6, Dublin North-West, Glasnevin and part of Cabra are also covered.  The services provided are psychiatry, clinical psychology, social work, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, administration, registrars in child psychiatry, trainees and students in all disciplines. <\/p><p>  The referral process is for children from birth to 16 years with persistent mental health problems such as emotional, behavioural, developmental and other psychiatric disorders.  It also concerns problems that impact on functioning at home, in school or in relationships that have not been resolved by primary care level intervention, including the National Educational Psychological Service.  We are talking about deliberate self-harm, suicidal thinking, depression, mood disorder, complex and severe anxiety, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, significant emotional and behavioural difficulties, post-traumatic stress disorder, complex behavioural problems, conduct disorder, complex behavioural response, psychosis, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and complex developmental problems.<\/p><p>  Local school principals dealing with these very vulnerable children in an acutely disadvantaged area, which is the team A area in Dublin North-Central, are being told they can only get referrals to use the Mater CAMHS service through their local general practitioner.  Children in Dublin 2 or 4 can therefore be referred by their local school principal, but children in Dublin 1 and 3 have to go through their GP.  This is completely unfair, unwarranted and unnecessary.  We are asking school principals to bring a parent and child to their local GP before they can make an essential and sometimes immediate intervention to save a child's mental health or potentially save a child's life.<\/p><p>  People working within the service are saying this is completely unworkable.  Why is a child in Dublin 1 being treated differently from a child in Dublin 2 or 4?  The referral process should be uniform throughout the system.  Will the Minister ensure principals in the team A area for Mater CAMHS will continue to be allowed to refer vulnerable children to this most important service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200028#AA00500","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1396441500,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue for discussion today and giving me the opportunity to discuss it.<\/p><p>  The Dublin north city and county child and adolescent mental health service, formally known as Mater CAMHS, has become part of the HSE from 1 January this year.  Currently, referrals can be made to Dublin north city and county CAMHS from 13 different referral sources, which would not be consistent with national policy as advocated by A Vision for Change.  The service is currently reviewing its existing clinical care pathway and referral criteria to bring it into line with A Vision for Change and the other mental health specialties.  As part of this review it is developing a plan for the implementation for the standard referral pathway and referral criteria which, when implemented, will reflect A Vision for Change and national policy.  This plan will be implemented in 2014.  Some of the teams had reduced the number of referral sources in anticipation of the wider plan.  However, the service can confirm that in advance of its referral criteria being brought in line with national policy, it will continue to consider all referrals, including those from schools.<\/p><p>  Community child and adolescent mental health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for those under 18 years of age, providing acute secondary mental health care.  The assessment and intervention provided is determined by the severity and complexity of presenting cases.  Nationally, there are a total of 61 child and adolescent mental health teams, comprising 56 community-based teams, two adolescent day hospital teams, and three hospital paediatric teams.  All community CAMHS teams screen referrals received, with those deemed urgent seen as a priority and those regarded as routine placed on a waiting list.  In the period 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013, a total of just over 12,000 referrals were accepted by the HSE, representing a 21% increase when compared with the previous 12 months.  This statistic alone highlights the challenges being faced in providing mental health services.  Arising from the investment in mental health in 2012 and 2013, 232 new posts and &euro;7.5 million were allocated to enhance CAMHS community team provision.  Of these, 171 or approximately 75% had started in their posts by 31 January last.<\/p><p>  The HSE will continue to prioritise investment in CAMHS services in line with A Vision for Change.  The &euro;20 million allocated to mental health for 2014 will allow between 250 and 280 more posts to be filled.  As outlined in the national mental health division operational plan for 2014, a comprehensive workforce analysis will inform the best targeting of the 2014 investment.  It is expected that a proportion of the new posts will be allocated to CAMHS to build on the 2012 and 2013 investments.<\/p><p>  The detailed annual CAMHS reports will continue to report on the activity, access, timeliness and resources of these services.  I wish to reiterate the Government's strong commitment to developing mental health services for children and adolescents nationally.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200028#AA00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1396441500,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I note he said that \"the service can confirm that in advance of its referral criteria being brought in line with national policy, it will continue to consider all referrals, including those from schools\".  The problem though is that the Mater CAMHS is telling local school principals something different.  While people within the service are quietly telling principals that they think this is unworkable and they want the previous criteria to remain, the Minister's message and the message local principals are getting from Mater CAMHS are two very different things.  I ask the Minister to ensure local schools dealing with these vulnerable children are aware they can still refer such children to the local Mater CAMHS and that the situation has not changed.  Will the Minister also communicate that to the service itself?  We do not want mixed messages to be coming from the Minister and the local Mater CAMHS.<\/p><p>  According to a presentation for principals by that service, the HSE is recommending that referrals come through the local GP.  Two very different messages are coming out here, so we need clarity.

It provides an opportunity to communicate with service users as well as service providers.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who cannot be here due to a family bereavement.  I apologise on her behalf and note that our thoughts and wishes are with her.  I will discuss the matter with her.  I have no doubt that she will be in a position to communicate a clear message to the services concerned.  The question of whether it is more appropriate that referrals be carried out through certain pathways rather than in a broader sense is a matter for further discussion given the hugely increased pressure under which the service has come.  That increase in pressure is evidenced by the statistics I have just set out to the Chamber.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to dealing with mental health issues and to ending the situation whereby children with serious mental health issues are admitted to adult facilities.  We have reduced the incidence of that considerably.  We are committed to ensuring that people are looked after in the community, which is the first line of defence.  That is appropriate because it is where most needs can be met and it is far more convenient for parents and their children not to have to spend a great deal of time travelling to specialist clinics.  It would be better to have local clinics accessed through local referral pathways.<\/p><p>  I will certainly raise the Deputy's concerns with the Minister of State and we will clarify matters.  The note from the Department is very clear that the current system of referral has not changed.  I note from the document the Deputy read out the suggestion that it might be best done through the general practitioner.  I do not have a difficulty with that but I accept equally that school teachers who are dealing with children on a daily basis are often skilled at detecting problems that might require further investigation.  Such teachers should be facilitated for the sake of the child, which is what we are all interested in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200029#BB00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","time":1396442100,"counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200029#BB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1396442100,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this Topical Issue.  I will reference a local example, but the underlying issue is one of national importance.<\/p><p>  Last Thursday week, 20 March 2014, planning permission which had been granted by Cork City Council for a development on the quays in the city centre of office accommodation for 2,000 workers was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Under the current rules, any individual or company has an absolute right to make such an appeal.  I have two difficulties with the current situation, the first of which relates to the length of time and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process.<\/p><p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la uses the unusual term &quot;statutory objective&quot; regarding its intention to deal with appeals within 18 weeks.  However, it is not a statutory requirement.  There is a statutory requirement on local authorities to deal with planning applications within four months, including a month for extra information.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make the case that it has increased the pace at which it deals with appeals.  While Ireland is doing exceptionally well on international competitiveness charts, one area in which we are not faring well involves the uncertainty in the planning process.  It is no consolation for a company seeking certainty to wonder whether it will fall within the 20% of appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which can take up to a year to process.  The proposed development in Cork has a specific client with 700 jobs to offer.  We are competing in Cork not only with other Irish cities, but other countries which would like to attract the specific company.  One of the reasons the company is willing to locate in Cork is to have specific offices designed and built as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  My second difficulty relates to the mode of appeal.  Anyone who has made an application or an objection to an application at the local authority stage may appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The fees on appeal are up to &euro;50.  There is no restriction on anyone who wishes to make an observation on a local authority planning application.  A person may be based anywhere in the country and object to an application in Cork regarding which he or she has no skin in the game.  That must be looked at.  People can object for competitive reasons.  I note that in Cork an objector has argued that it has similar office space to offer.  I assume the company has looked at that.  Some business in Dublin might object to a business's plans in Cork without having any reason or having to provide a reason.<\/p><p>  I ask that the time for disposing of appeals be made a statutory requirement for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I also ask that the grounds on which an objection can be made be examined while protecting people with geographical or other valid reasons for objecting to a development.  We are seeing cases arising in circumstances in which jobs are being created.  I urge the Minister to consider the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200029#BB00400","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1396442100,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  There are two issues to discuss in addressing the issues raised while bearing in mind that under section 30 of the Planning and Development Acts I am precluded from discussing individual developments which are matters for the appropriate planning authority - in this case Cork City Council.<\/p><p>  Legislation sets down a requirement for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure that planning appeals are determined within an 18 week period.  The board has a strategic objective to determine the bulk of cases within this period.  In 2013, more than 72% of appeals were concluded within 18 weeks.  Those appeals represented the bulk of the planning workload.  As of February 2014, the compliance rate for normal planning appeals with the statutory objective was 80%.<\/p><p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la operates a classification system designed to identify and prioritise the processing of certain types of appeals.  Generally, the system prioritises cases at the earliest stages which have significant employment potential or involve projects of significant economic potential on a national, regional and-or local scale.  The project to which the Deputy refers falls into that category.  Also prioritised are major infrastructure developments that would not be classified under the legislation as strategic infrastructure.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 established a strategic infrastructure division within An Bord Plean&aacute;la to act as a one stop shop in respect of all major infrastructure projects.  In addition to motorways and local authority projects, which were already handled by the board, the strategic infrastructure division is the sole planning consent authority for major electricity transmission lines, railway lines, heavy and light rail and metro orders, infrastructure requiring environmental impact assessment, such as significant airport or port developments, waste infrastructure, very large energy projects and strategic upstream and downstream gas pipelines.<\/p><p>  Regarding the assessment of planning appeals by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it should be remembered that the 18 week objective is broken down into a number of deadlines which facilitate the making of an informed decision.  The board must gather all relevant information from the planning authority, applicants and parties to the appeal and enable the relevant parties to provide feedback.  The process is particularly challenging in the case of strategic infrastructure.  Accordingly, attempts to cut back the 18 week decision period could have a bearing on the ability of the board to make an informed decisions, which is key to the whole process.  The point the Deputy makes as to the large number of jobs offered by a key employer indicate that the matter will fall into the priority category.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200029#BB00500","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1396442100,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I welcome the reference to priority.<\/p><p>It is not clear, however, whether the company in question can be informed that it is being given priority as the position in this regard remains a little vague.<\/p><p> While I do not have any issue with a timeframe for processing applications of 18 weeks and I am aware of the 80% target and the other figures cited by the Minister of State, I cannot understand the reason the position cannot be changed to require An Bord Plean&aacute;la to meet the same target as local authorities, which must deal with 100% of applications within four months.  I fully accept that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's performance has improved and that if decisions are made within the timeframe in 80% of cases, 80% of applicants will be happy.  However, if An Bord Plean&aacute;la were required to process all applications within 18 weeks, large companies would have a definitive timeframe for a decision on their application and could report to their parent boards that a cap of 18 weeks - essentially four months - applies to the processing of planning applications in Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this matter. <\/p><p> The Minister of State did not refer to the second issue I raised, namely, the practice by which companies lodge objections to planning applications for competitive or, worse still, scurrilous reasons.

Each week, between three and five new cases of families in mortgage distress present at my office.  This is in addition to families already being processed by my office.  For most of the families involved, dealing with this issue is a disaster.  They experience the stress of potentially losing their home and the financial challenge of trying to meet mortgage repayments, while trying to feed and clothe their families and cover the costs of school, visits to the doctor and so forth.  Facing all of these issues is a perfect storm for many of these families.<\/p><p>  Another group of people are in a worse position, however.  In addition to mortgage distress, unemployment, negative equity and so forth, an increasing number of people seeking advice at my office are dealing with relationship breakdown.  In other words, not only are they experiencing all of the crises faced by other families, but they are also facing family breakdown.  In a significant proportion of the cases of mortgage distress my office deals with, the main reason is the breakdown of relationships.  In many cases, the person who remains in the family home is unable to meet the mortgage repayment on the home.  It is unfortunate that this problem is not discussed in the House or media because the numbers affected are growing. <\/p><p>  If this were not bad enough, many families are facing homelessness as a result of their circumstances.  Separated mothers or fathers and their children may be able to secure support from their local authority if they have experienced physical abuse from a partner and have been forced out of their homes.  However, in many of the cases I deal with, families cannot live in the family home following a separation because the environment in the home has become extremely unhealthy for one of the partners and the children.  While physical violence may not occur, such toxic conditions force people to leave their homes.  Typically in such scenarios, families who apply for rent supplement or to be placed on the local authority housing list, all of which are extremely long, are informed that they do not have a housing need because they have a house or their name appears on a mortgage.  These people are being left in limbo as they face the possibility of homelessness.  While it is technically correct that they have a house, the toxic nature of their home environment means they do not have anywhere to live.  In such circumstances, the mother and children must present to the local authority seeking emergency accommodation.  Many of the people in question are accommodated in bed and breakfast accommodation, flats or must share a house with other people, none of which is suitable for families.  The cost of temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfast solutions is shockingly high. <\/p><p>  Families in these types of cases have no option but to become homeless because the current legal position and structure does not recognise their family circumstances.  Sleeping rough is becoming more common on the streets of Dublin and other towns and cities and the number of people accessing emergency homeless services has increased by 40%.  These issues are interrelated and I ask the Minister of State to think hard about a solution for families experiencing the circumstances I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200030#CC00600","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1396442700,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for raising this matter.  While different personal, financial and social reasons can contribute to a person becoming homeless, for those involved the effects on their personal life are similarly traumatic and disabling.  Societally, the ramifications of homelessness are also equally as destructive and costly.  For this reason, I am strongly focused on achieving the Government's ambitious goal of ending long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>  In February 2013, I published the Government's homelessness policy statement which set out the aim of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach, which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>  The homelessness oversight group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions, has submitted its first report to me.  The report considered the prevention of homelessness, the families presenting as homeless and housing supply.  A copy of the report is available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  On 25 February 2014, the Government approved the establishment of a homelessness policy implementation team and an implementation unit.  The team is tasked with implementing the oversight group's first report.  This will include the preparation and publication of a structured, practical plan to make the transition from a shelter-led to a sustainable housing-led response to homelessness and achieve the 2016 goals for homelessness.<\/p><p>  The implementation team is representative of the key State agencies dealing with homelessness, housing and related services because the solutions to homelessness do not solely reside in my Department.<\/p><p>The team is being led by my Department and includes a senior official from the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive, as well as the managers of Dublin City Council and Monaghan County Council, representing local authorities.  The team will report on this plan to the Cabinet committee on social policy later this month and quarterly thereafter.  <\/p><p> I am acutely aware of the significant number of families now presenting as homeless in the Dublin region owing to economic difficulties, job loss, a decline in house supply and, as mentioned by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, relationship breakdown.  More than half a billion euro in funding is being made available through my Department in 2014 across a range of housing programmes and I expect that in the region of 5,000 social housing units will be provided this year.  I am committed to continuing to develop innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing.  I want to see an increase in the supply of new social homes and to ensure that every available appropriate unit that exists is transformed into a home as quickly as is reasonably possible.  Included in this is the transfer of NAMA units, in respect of which 596 were provided to the end of 2013.  <\/p><p> On the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that a household with alternative accommodation that would meet its housing need is ineligible for social housing support, but the regulations clarify that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced.  Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases.  I am aware that there are people who do not have a deed of separation.  The legislation operates satisfactorily in most cases.  However, I am currently considering in the context of the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill currently in preparation, whether legislative change is warranted to deal with exceptional cases that present difficulties under the current arrangements.  I am examining whether it is possible to provide for greater flexibility in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200030#CC00700","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396443300,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Many people in relationship breakdown do not have the funds to engage in the separation and divorce process.  Many of the families involved are at their wits end.  While some people may potentially have a legal claim to a property, owing to the difficulties they have left behind all they want to do is start afresh.  I will give one example from the many cases with which I have been dealing.  A young mother of three children who suffered abuse in her family home applied for social housing but was refused on the grounds of owning a home.  Following many applications for rent allowance she was eventually approved, only to have it withdrawn, again for the reason that she owned a home, as a result of which she amassed huge rent arrears and was forced out of the house by her landlord around Christmas time.  Following reapplication by her for rent allowance, and with a great deal of pressure from my office, the rent allowance was re-approved.  She then engaged in a huge trawl of accommodation in the town but could find none within the rent cap for the area.  As a result she had to uproot her family from their home and her children from their schools and move to another town.  The house she secured is damp and as her youngest child has asthma he cannot reside with her in the house and has to live with his granny for most of the week.  The landlord has stated that he did not want to rent out the house but was forced to do so by the local authority because it is under pressure to house people.  The window of the house recently fell out.  This woman is in serious difficulty and is trying to find alternative accommodation.<\/p><p>  The current rent cap for County Meath is causing major difficulties.  There is no separation of areas to reflect higher rents.  The people about whom I am speaking are in serious difficulty.  I listened to the response by the Minister of State and accept that she recognises the problem.  However, much of her response related to objectives, teams, reports, plans and so on.  There are families in fiercely distraught circumstances.  Not having the confidence of a roof over their heads is one of the problems which this Government needs to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200031#DD00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1396443300,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I do recognise that it is a real problem.

In many of the cases involved, a person's name may, at the point of registering as having a long term housing need, be on the deeds of a house.  We are examining what can be done in this regard, including whether they can be provided with short term accommodation, with their application being reviewed at a later time.

In recognition of the fact that consultation took place on the matter, I wish to read some information into the record of the House.  The accountancy profession is, in general, adaptable and agile and is able to respond to new market opportunities and directions.  This is, to a great extent, because it is not tied down by layers of regulation.  There are detailed statutory provisions relating to auditing and, to a lesser extent, insolvency practice.  The Competition Authority holds the view that this is the way things should stay.  New regulations should only be introduced where there is clear evidence of market failure or very damaging consumer harm.  That has not been established as the position here.<\/p><p>  When the matter was reviewed by the Department at the time of drafting, the view was taken that there was no case for introducing a system of regulation for the profession generally.  On the contrary, it was felt that introducing such a system would put at risk the flexibility of the profession and its ability to respond to client needs, be it in traditional areas such as tax advice or management accounts or in emerging fields such as succession planning.  New layers of regulation could also stultify further growth and innovation.  Having examined the issue from the standpoint of the principles of better regulation, the Competition Authority concluded that there was no public interest case requiring legal protection of the term &quot;accountant&quot;.  In response to the concerns of the industry, however, the Minister has agreed to consult fully on the matter.  I am informed that the review will happen this year but we do not have a definitive timeline in respect of it.  However, I am not sure whether it was agreed that the review would be completed in advance of the conclusion of the deliberations on this legislation.

I pay tribute to the predecessors of the Minister of State, many of whom saw this through, as well as to the various chairmen of the enterprise committees.  I remember coming to the House in 2007.  At the first meeting of the enterprise committee in 2007, Deputy Willie Penrose, who was chairing, advised us to clear our diaries for the first quarter of 2008 because the Bill would come through at that stage.

The resources to disseminate the requirements of this Bill need to be given to the relevant agencies because they are considerable.  It is a sea change.  As I said earlier, we have seen how lacunae and gaps in company law legislation have let this country down.  We have put a good deal of work into ensuring that those gaps are remedied.

The issue of modernising company law has taken in many people and many different views.  It has seemed like an impossible task, looking back on it.  However, it has been done by people paying attention to detail and it has taken a vast amount of effort as well.<\/p><p>  We take the view that the Companies Bill should have been an opportunity to solve several major problems that are affecting society.  I understand the Government has probably taken the view that this is separate to those problems and that those particular problems should be dealt with elsewhere.  We take the view that where an opportunity exists, we should take it and ensure we fix the problem.<\/p><p>  Some of those problems come about with regard to the lessons we have learned concerning regulation since the crash.  I believe opportunities have been lost with this Bill in that regard.  The robustness of the compliance statements and responsibilities have not been to our liking.  Some of the unions and ICTU have indicated their concern that companies will gain more legal personality and that this may conflict in future with citizens' rights and protections.<\/p><p>  The idea of Irish-registered non-resident companies is problematic, as is the difficult and wrong tax problem that is affecting the level of funds that comes into this State and the reputation of the State internationally.  This is one of the biggest problems the State is facing with regard to loss of revenue and loss of reputation.  We would have preferred to see these issues dealt with in the Bill.  I have already remarked on compliance.<\/p><p>  We took the view that there are several issues with regard to the winding up of companies.  We have seen in the past 18 months especially a large number of employees who have been on the wrong side of businesses and companies which have wound up.  Every day we see unscrupulous companies - they are by far in the minority but they exist none the less - which use company law to aid their efforts in reducing their exposure to fulfilling their rights to employees.  We believe employees are insufficiently protected and we would prefer to have seen this reflected in the Bill.  The opportunity remains for the Government to address some of these problems and we hope it will consider these and the Sinn F&eacute;in proposals in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200033#FF02400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1396444500,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I was tempted to call a vote on the Bill but it would be a little unfair.

Amendment No. 3 is short.  I also tabled it on Committee Stage.  Everyone accepts its principle.  I do not have the figures before me and I am a little bit rusty, but I am sure that the taxpayer is paying &euro;1.5 million into these parliamentary activities allowance funds, formerly known as the party leader's allowance funds, annually.  The essence of my point is not unreasonable, in that, when this amount of money is paid into a particular account each year, the people responsible should produce a tax clearance certificate.  It would not be acceptable for any State body to pay so much money to an organisation, be it a contractor or service provider, without seeing a tax clearance certificate.  This is standard procedure whenever over deals with Departments.<\/p><p>  As Deputies, we must return tax clearance certificates when we run for election.  Those certificates hold for the period of the D&aacute;il to which we are elected and we are not required to produce a certificate each subsequent year.  I am not suggesting that that be the case either, as people elsewhere in the public service do not need to produce their tax clearance certificates each year.  However, this is a specific allowance and there should be a requirement of a tax clearance certificate.<\/p><p>  The Minister may have been right to a point on Committee Stage, but he nitpicked the word &quot;fund&quot; and asked whether it meant a person, an organisation, a bank etc.  We did not really deal with the key issue.  I had hoped that he would take the gist of my comments on Committee Stage on board and am disappointed that he did not.  I will move on, however, as there may be a good way to resolve this issue.<\/p><p>  The first amendment I moved yesterday called for the parliamentary activities allowance to be paid into an account of the qualifying party rather than into a named account of the party leader.  We debated this matter then and on Committee Stage.  Usefully, the Minister clarified the reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200034#GG00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1396445100,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I checked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200034#GG00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1396445100,"counter":723,"content":"<p>The money is being paid into accounts that are not in the party leaders' names.  What I was seeking to achieve was actually the case anyway.  The Minister did not even need to object to the amendment, but the clarification was helpful.<\/p><p>  The same approach could be taken in this instance.  My understanding is that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, will introduce regulations on how these accounts should be administered.  These must be clear and drafts must be given to party leaders.  SIPO has a public obligation to include in the draft regulations, be they secondary legislation or guidelines on auditing standards that must be followed, the requirement for an annual tax clearance certificate.  Let it be done on an administrative basis instead of through primary legislation.  The essence of my point is correct, in that the State should not hand out that much money each year without tax clearance certificates.  I would hand the job over to SIPO and let the Minister off the hook by requiring the inclusion of this amendment in the legislation, although I suspect he will not agree to it.  As SIPO requires audited accounts, it should also require tax clearance certificates and report to the House if necessary.

The legislation provides that the allowance paid to parties in Government be reduced by one third in respect of each of their members.  The mechanics of it mean that the Government parties get whatever their allowance would be under the first line of computation and it is reduced by one third.  I propose that it be reduced by a half.  The number of people taken on by Governments in recent decades in terms of special advisers, press officers, ministerial advisers and so forth means that the amount of support available to a Minister has increased substantially.

Ministers have parliamentary supports in terms of advisers and Departments.  However, there is a big phalanx of backbenchers, particularly in this D&aacute;il, who should be entitled, given that we are trying to enhance Parliament, to draft their own legislation for the Friday sittings, critique legislation and formulate policies, and have the support to do that.

It has existed for decades, including when my party was in Government.  However, in these days of openness and transparency, I ask the Minister to think about this point.  It would be valid for these allowances to be voted through the House each year and it would also be valid to vote on pensions and so forth.  I understand there is some expenditure for postal purposes for elections and referenda that is not subject to a vote but is also paid from the Central Fund.  Perhaps it is because one cannot properly estimate those expenditures at the beginning of the year but a nominal Estimate could be included.  It would be better if Parliament discussed all expenditure.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should try to achieve that, to ensure all expenditure of taxpayers' money is discussed and voted through the House in the Estimates process each year.  This allowance should be part of that process and should also be discussed in the House each year.

It probably would be more democratic if everything was required to be brought formally to the House as opposed to being paid for from the Central Fund.

There was a great degree of support for that principle when we discussed this on Committee Stage.

There must be a minimum of seven Members and a majority of those must not be aligned to a political party.  There can only be one technical group and as a consequence, there can only be one majority and that pretty much determines that.  According to the way it is interpreted, a Deputy is or is not a member of a group the day he or she is elected, so it is a fixed number at that point.<\/p><p>  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission runs the House and has a budget to do that.  The expectation is that when there is a group of that size, there is some guaranteed mechanism of co-ordination.  The Technical Group currently employs two people essentially, one of whom is on a job-share basis.  We are told that it is an administrative convenience to provide names to the Ceann Comhairle but it would be difficult to foresee how it would be done without that and for the House to function, especially to know where the likes of Ministers are likely to be at any given time.  Essentially this is something that makes for smooth running.  With 15 or 16 Members in our group, it is not a simple task like it is for parties, which have spokespersons and so on.  Considerable co-ordination is required.<\/p><p>  Whatever about the internal co-ordination of the group itself, how we interact with the House is important.  There is a lot of communication with the Government and Opposition Whips.  There can be late changes which we can make and the House can then run smoothly.  We liaise with the Questions Office and we are now required to provide lists and things like that, so more is required of us now than there was at the beginning.  We have to liaise with the Bills Office and make sure things are on the Order Paper, and liaise with the Journals Office.  If we are putting through Private Members' Business on a Wednesday - we have one in every three - it will not be accepted from an individual Deputy as it must come through the Whips' office.  The House demands this of us, so there is a recognition of a need for it, but there is no direct provision and the legislation has a gap.<\/p><p>  We help to facilitate business continuity planning in case of emergencies.  We have to provide a telephone number of a person who can be contacted by day and night.  We provide our co-ordinator, who is employed by us separately to being employed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We manage facilities when the photocopier breaks down.  There is not just one Deputy involved and there has to be co-ordination, even for things like letting the engineer gain access.<\/p><p>  We are located in Agriculture House and aspects such as car parking, people getting locked in, the provision of badges and so on are all examples of the practical issues that help to make this House function.  Essentially it would not be expected that a political party would have to do this without that resource, but our group has been expected to do it without a direct provision of a resource.  That is the argument we have been making over the last two years.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister is not going to accept this amendment because we have spoken about it.  It is very disappointing because this is the big opportunity that we see to insert this in the legislation as a matter of entitlement, where there is a group that is recognised under Standing Orders.  Some will argue that we should have full parity with the parties but I am not arguing that.  I am arguing that there should be a provision that is sufficient to allow the functioning of the group.  I wish to acknowledge that the Minister sent me a letter about what the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission can do.  It appears that we could make an argument that we could get a secretarial assistant attached to me because I have been nominated as the Whip.  That is not something that is a guaranteed for a group that is a recognised group.  That is the key issue here.  The Minister has also told me that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission can revise its regulations but representatives of the Commission have told me that the impediment for them in dealing with us is that it is not provided for in law, and that the only groups provided for in law are political parties.<\/p><p>  I believe we have made a valid case.  We are here because we put ourselves as Independents or people from small parties.  The electorate decided to elect a large number of us.  Independents have been in this House since the State was founded.  I acknowledge that this is an unusual situation in that there is such a large group of us but it is not the first time there has been a large group.  The last time I was a Member, there was a Technical Group, and there was also a Technical Group in the last D&aacute;il following a by-election.  It is recognising the reality and giving a guarantee that there is a minimum that will be provided with regard to the functioning of the House.  It is not about deciding on policy because we do not do that and we clearly cannot do so because we are a very disparate group.  It is not about those functions; it is merely about making this House function in a way that works for all of us.  It works for Ministers, who have one telephone number they can call and we can make sure that our group is briefed or whatever.  It works for all of us, but it has to be provided for.  There is a difficulty with the way that it is suggested, although I acknowledge that it would probably be the fist step in terms of progressing the issue.  However, it is inadequate for the reasons I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200036#JJ00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1396446300,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the amendment.

The Deputy's intention is to increase the secretarial facilities, which are broader than \"secretary\" in the traditional sense.  It can be a support made available to the Technical Group but at the expense of parties, because it shifts the money within the pool.<\/p><p> We have had discussions and exchanged correspondence on this.  I have indicated on the record of the House that I am sympathetic to the view the Deputy has expressed.  It took me a while to reach that position.  It cannot be the case that Independents are suddenly seen as a party.  Clearly they cannot avail of common research and policy formation services.  All shades of opinion are represented within the existing Technical Group.  The members of that group have diametrically opposed views on many issues.  I think a valid case has been made regarding the practicalities of organising notices and co-ordination.<\/p><p> As Deputy Murphy knows, I examined her amendment in detail in advance of Committee Stage and again in advance of this Stage to see how this matter could be addressed.  Having drilled into the proposal, and having received strong advice on the matter, I do not believe the legislative route that has been proposed represents the best way to deal with this issue as it would open up other vistas that are not intended in this regard.  However, I am of the view that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has the power under the existing legislation to provide such secretarial facilities to individual Members of this House as it determines appropriate.  The Deputy is right to suggest that this would require the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to determine that Deputy Murphy, as Whip, or some other person - I do not know whether the Technical Group has a chair - is entitled to additional secretarial support.  The Whip would probably be the right person to be provided with such assistance because of the administrative burden that falls on her.  I would support that.<\/p><p> I have formally written a long letter to Deputy Murphy quoting the legal instruments and making it clear that I believe this is doable and feasible.  I hope the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will accept that.  It might not go as far as the Deputy would like for a number of reasons, the first of which is that it would not be a permanent solution.  Depending on the structure of the next D&aacute;il, these arguments could have to be made again.  I think they will be made in any event, even if the next D&aacute;il is completely different in structure from this one.  It is possible for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, through existing Standing Orders and regulations, to provide Deputy Murphy with secretarial assistance in acknowledgement of the additional role of co-ordinator that she performs within the Technical Group in the interests of the effective carrying out of the business of the House.  Equally, the commission can decided to amend its own Standing Orders and rules for these purposes.<\/p><p> Deputy Murphy will acknowledge that in my discussions with her, I have been doing my best to address these issues.  I know I have not been going as far as she would like.  I understand the argument that an additional support official should be available to the Technical Group to provide necessary co-ordination services.  If the Deputy could nudge the recalcitrant members of the Technical Group to pay their subscriptions, perhaps it would ensure that an adequate resource is available to the group to enable this work to be done effectively.  I have no objection to the formal use by the Deputy of my letter when she is pursuing this matter with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I hope she does so.  If I can assist in that endeavour, I will make myself and my office available for those purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200036#JJ00500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396446900,"counter":754,"content":"<p>The great majority of members of the Technical Group make a contribution and just one person has failed to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200037#KK00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1396446900,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I did not namecheck anyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200037#KK00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1396446900,"counter":756,"content":"<p>This does create a difficulty when contracts are being agreed with people who are working.

I might talk to the Minister about this issue again.<\/p><p>  Is the Minister satisfied that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is not excluded from assisting?  We were told it could not assist because it was not legally allowed to do so.  Is the Minister satisfied that is not the case?  I acknowledge the change that has been made to the parliamentary activities allowance.  It is an improvement because it is more reflective of the reality.  Like some other Deputies, I find it very useful to be able to employ an extra person.  That is the support we get.  Those within the party system get greater support from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Fianna F&aacute;il gets 17.25 secretarial assistant equivalents and Sinn F&eacute;in gets 9.75 secretarial assistant equivalents.  It is quite a large provision of additional assistance.  Both parties do well from the premium on the leader's allowance.  All parties that get more than 2% in the opinion polls get support under the Electoral Acts.  This does not apply to Independents.<\/p><p>  I do not think it is unreasonable to press the point that Independents should receive a guaranteed support to enable us to function in the House in a better way.  I do not think anyone who examines the functioning of the Technical Group would dispute that.  The most common criticism we receive from the Government side is not that we do not do enough - it is that we are sometimes over-represented when it comes to speaking.  I think most Ministers have said that at some point.  I suggest that this minimum level of support is required by this active group of Deputies.  I am afraid that I will have to press this amendment on a point of principle.

The D&aacute;il is continuing to evolve, but there remains a quantitative difference between a parliamentary party and a technical group.  I think Deputy Murphy acknowledges that.  Each individual member of the Technical Group has a personal allowance for himself or herself that a party does not get.  The members of the group can pool that money if they want.  If a certain member of the Technical Group is reluctant to do so, that is unfortunate.  The Technical Group can choose to set a stipend for common purposes at any level it likes from the significant amount of money that is available to each of its members.  I invite the Deputy to consider that when a significant sum of State money is being provided in support of an individual Deputy, I have to be mindful that it could be used for a common purpose involving co-ordination in the House.  Having said that, a case has been made for an additional person to do co-ordination and support work.  That is a reasonable settlement in the current climate.  Perhaps Deputy Murphy would like me to go further but there are others in the House who believe the members of the Technical Group are already doing very well on an individual basis.  If they were to pool some of their money collectively, they could have quite a significant resource to use in the House.

However, it is not the intention that the commission, or SIPO, should have a sole interpretative role in regard to this allowance.  It falls to me, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to have a properly constituted involvement in the final guidelines in so far as they relate to the allowance.<\/p><p>  There is no question of any lack of trust in the capabilities or the independence of the commission.

The Minister who is responsible has to have some oversight and it would be wrong to cede my authority in regard to the allowance.

Before the current Minister came to power, I would have imagined that the Molloy family, relations of Father Niall Molloy, would have been rather excited at the prospect of what the Minister would do and the fact that he would deal with this case.  He met with members of the Molloy family before he became Minister.  On Wednesday, 17 November 2010 he addressed the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Dermot Ahern, in the D&aacute;il and questioned him on the matter.  He asked if the Minister intended to have an investigation into the death of Father Molloy conducted by the Garda Commissioner and whether the Commissioner would examine whether the initial investigation was properly conducted, given the concerns that crucial evidence was not taken account of.  He also asked about the manner in which Judge Roe dealt with the case when he dismissed it on the grounds that Father Molloy had died of a heart attack when in fact the inquest ruled that he died from head injuries.  Sadly, since the Minister has got into power, he has not followed up on these issues.  In fact, there has been no official Garda investigation.  According to the Molloy family, the Minister refuses to meet with them.  They got a little bit of hope when Mr. Dominic McGinn, a Senior Counsel, was officially appointed in February to identify whether there were any serious issues of public interest or concern in connection with the probe by the Garda serious crime review team.  However, the family has heard nothing from this man.  Surely they should have been talked to.  Finally, I wish to ask about Brian Purcell.  He had a connection with the prison service; apparently he ran the prison service.  Now, we discover that phones were tapped in the prison service.  What did he know about that?

Almost all Opposition Deputies who attacked the Minister in recent weeks commenced their contributions with an acknowledgment that he is a hard-working and reforming Minister before dismissing these qualities as if they did not matter.  As a Deputy from Kildare South, a constituency that includes the Curragh, I recall that local people were seriously concerned when the Government came to power because it decided to merge the defence and justice portfolios in one Department.  People feared this would result in the downgrading of the defence portfolio.  Since then, however, various Defence Force personnel have indicated to me on numerous occasions that this is an excellent Minister who has been seen more often in the Curragh than many of his predecessors whose only brief was justice.  I congratulate the Minister on sticking to the pledge to maintain Defence Force strength at 9,500.  In the face of significant austerity measures and cuts in every area, the Minister stuck to his word at the Cabinet table and adhered to the Fine Gael promise to maintain Defence Force strength.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200044#RR00800","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1396450500,"counter":837,"content":"<p>The bigger picture in this debate is that issues have arisen and the Minister took appropriate and speedy action.

He has been unafraid to tackle difficult issues which others were happy to ignore.  He has worked to improve our legislative system, both as a Minister and in opposition, and his legacy is one of reform and progress.  As with most members of the Government, he came into office facing a range of challenges which had been long-fingered for some time, and set about methodically addressing them, one by one.<\/p><p>  The Minister's record speaks for itself.  As many of my colleagues noted, during the past 36 months he has been directly involved in the drafting, publication and enactment of 40 separate legislative items.  His work rate is second to none, as Deputies on all sides know.  This is a common thread in all the work he has done since 2011, whether on personal insolvency and debt relief or in addressing white collar crime, penal reform, vetting and child protection, judicial pay, equality, human rights or human trafficking.  All of these issues impact on people in all parts of the country.  The Minister's work has improved the position of people throughout the country in all these areas and many more. <\/p><p>  The most important thing now is that, following the conclusion of the various inquiries which the Minister and Government have established, we ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains the respected force it has been since the foundation of the State and enjoys the full confidence of the people whose freedoms it serves and protects.  With this in mind, the Government has reiterated its commitment to reform Garda oversight and accountability, including by establishing an independent Garda authority.  The Government will announce the full details of its comprehensive reform proposals in the coming months.  This will be done following the completion of the current inquiries by Judge Cook and Mr. Guerin and the forthcoming hearings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.

He has overseen referendums to reduce judges' pay in line with the pay cuts in the public sector and the introduction of a new Court of Appeal to make our court systems more efficient.  Deputy Shatter has proven himself to be a compassionate Minister who is not slow to tackle the legacy issues he has inherited.  As stated by others, children are no longer committed to St. Patrick's institution and a committee to investigate the Magdalen Laundries and a scheme to support and compensate the Magdalen women has been established.  His expertise in family law will make a real difference in the future with the publication of the child and family relations Bill.  This significantly reforms family law and most importantly enhances the protection of children.<\/p><p>  Despite the disastrous financial situation inherited from the previous Government, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has in respect of the three year period 2012-14 secured additional funding over and above that allocated by Fianna F&aacute;il in its national recovery plan to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can continue to deliver an effective policing service.  He has also secured agreement for the recommencement of Garda recruitment.  The Minister is committed to human rights, equality and the rule of law and recently published the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2014 and has pioneered an EU human rights and equality initiative.  He has ensured that the backlog of applications for citizenship was addressed and secured Government approval to hold a referendum on marriage equality.<\/p><p>  In Deputy Alan Shatter we have a Minister for Justice and Equality who is reducing crime rates, reforming our sentencing and legal systems, tackling long-standing issues and advancing human rights.

This is apparently okay with the Labour Party.

What is involved is a mounting list of events which have already destroyed public confidence in the oversight by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, of one of the most vital areas handled by Government.  The administration of justice and public faith in our police force are not marginal issues: they cannot be pushed aside with the usual spin.  Four separate inquiries have been established into matters under the direct control of the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  In three instances, there is no question of his full knowledge of the issues and eagerness to declare files closed.  The inquiries followed public statements by the Minister that everything was fine.  In the case of the Garda and prison tapes, his Department was in possession of significant information for months.

He has acknowledged the theory that everyone makes mistakes but has refused to admit that he has made any.  In addition, he has fallen back on the worn-out, deeply cynical excuse that everything is the fault of his predecessors.<\/p><p>  Let it be very clear, Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the holding of an independent inquiry into the recording practices in Garda stations and prisons.  Let that inquiry address any time period it wants and question any former officer it wants.  The revelation of this past activity is not the reason the Minister, Deputy Shatter, should leave office.  Nobody has said it is.  What is at issue is a Minister whose actions in handling the exposure of problems has caused them to escalate to the point of crisis, whose actions have damaged morale within our police force and who is completely dismissive of legitimate questions about his behaviour and the behaviour of those he has been entrusted by the people to oversee.  <\/p><p>  The manner in which the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has carried out his role as Minister for Justice and Equality goes to the core of the reason the public has lost confidence in him and why we should vote no confidence in him tonight.  From his first days in office, he has been aggressively dismissive of any accountability to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or the wider public.  When faced with any specific challenges his immediate response has been to limit information and to attack those asking him questions.  Were this purely a matter of style, it would be serious but not fatal.  However, this behaviour has led to him taking actions which are incompatible with holding the post of Minister for Justice and Equality in a democratic Republic. <\/p><p>  In his early months in office, he started as he meant to go on.  He came into this House seeking to limit the time available to the Smithwick Tribunal and said that Judge Smithwick had no problem with what was being proposed.  It was only later, and through the freedom of information process, that we discovered that he had failed to tell the D&aacute;il that Judge Smithwick had written to him to object to what he termed his &quot;wholly inappropriate interference&quot; in the work of the tribunal.  When questioned, he attacked anyone who suggested that this information was relevant.  At roughly the same time in 2011, he appointed his personal friend and donor to serve as Garda confidential recipient.  Two years later, this friend and donor was fired for a reason which has still not been explained.  <\/p><p>  When Independent Deputies raised the possible abuse of the penalty points system the Minister's response was not to express concern and seek to get to the bottom of the problem but to go on the attack.<\/p><p>His misuse of confidential information supplied to him by the Garda Commissioner to attack Deputy Wallace with a false claim of hypocrisy remains a disgrace for which he should have resigned.  What compounds this is that a Fine Gael briefing document from last Thursday reportedly dismisses it as a &quot;minor issue&quot; and restates the false claim that Deputy Wallace received penalty points.  The Minister's disinterest in how information about another Deputy was leaked before the results from the tests to which she had submitted and which cleared her were available confirmed his highly partisan approach to a role which should be above such concerns.<\/p><p> When the persistence of the Garda whistleblowers meant that the issue would not go away, the Minister took every opportunity to dismiss them, including making attacks on them which he now, under pressure and with the minimum grace possible, admits were false.  When the possible bugging of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, was revealed, most<\/p><p>Ministers would have responded by committing immediately to investigate the situation.  In contrast, the response of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, was to immediately attack GSOC.  He supplied the Taoiseach with a false claim that GSOC had a statutory duty to inform him of these matters and he commissioned a technical report which said there was no issue for anyone to be concerned with.  The Cabinet showed no confidence in his judgment by agreeing to commission an independent report, albeit with strictly limited terms of reference.  For over a week we have been trying to get the Minister to explain why he agreed with the Taoiseach to take actions which directly led to the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p> The Minister said last night that he does not know if there are legal implications beyond the Bailey case.  He said it was the Bailey case alone which gave rise to alarm bells ringing.  The chronology published by his officials says former Commissioner Callinan acted on the same basis as the Department and the Attorney General, namely, that it was only the Bailey case which set the alarm bells ringing.  However, the Minister and the Taoiseach decided that former Commissioner Callinan alone required a visit in order to be informed him that his actions raised concerns.  Despite four attempts during Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach has failed to answer a simple direct question with regard to why he decided to put pressure on the then Commissioner in such a way as was clearly intended to get him to be the fall guy.  The Taoiseach will not explain why he and the Minister did not think they should talk to former Commissioner Callinan before deciding to act.  Why did they have so little respect for the position of Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they did not think the then incumbent had a right to be heard by them?  They admit that they did not even discuss his 10 March letter.

The inescapable conclusion is that the decision to send his most senior official to the former Commissioner's home on Monday evening last was influenced by the wish to make the latter the sole focus of attention.  For a week previous to that meeting, political sources had each day worked to take the attention away from the Minister and place it onto former Commissioner Callinan alone.

At issue here is the Minister's stewardship of the justice system during the past 18 months.  What is not at issue is what we have heard from his colleagues during this debate.  What is also not at issue is the Minister's undoubted intelligence, his capacity for hard work or his zeal to reform.  What is at issue is his capacity to manage.  There is a big difference between his capacity to legislate and his capacity to manage.  In my view he has shown a very poor level of performance in respect of issues that have arrived at his door, some of which were of his making while others were not.  The test of his capacity to manage those issues and deal with them effectively is what is at issue, not the kind of claptrap we have all been obliged to listen to since this debate began.<\/p><p>  The central theme here is that the former Garda Commissioner was forced out of office to save the Minister's skin and the blushes of the Labour Party.  What we have failed to elicit from the Minister, his colleagues and the Taoiseach in recent days is information as to why this happened.  I accept that the former Commissioner had issues on which to reflect in the context of his dealings with the whistleblowers, the penalty points controversy, GSOC, etc.  We understand that he was of a mind to make some form of statement and sought advice in that regard.  He was advised against making any statement.  Why was that the case?  If the former Commissioner had resigned on foot of the issues to which I refer or had reflected more deeply and apologised, the Minister would have been left in the same boat as him.  In fact, the Minister was probably more culpable because he had stuck his neck out much further than the former Commissioner in respect of those issues.<\/p><p>  On the Sunday before last, the Taoiseach came into possession of what we believe to be earth-shattering information.  I accept that said information relates to a serious issue but I wonder about the haste in proceeding to deal with it.  If there was a necessity for such haste, why were steps not taken to arrange a meeting involving the Minister, his officials, the great and the good from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach himself and officials from the Attorney General's office in order to try to get to the bottom of the matter?  The Taoiseach has stated that he spent the day validating the information he received.  There has still not been much clarity with regard to the process of validation which he undertook.  Another matter which is not at issue is that the Minister and the Secretary General of his Department sat down with the Taoiseach and the Secretary General of his Department.  My belief is that the Minister and the Secretary General at the Department of Justice and Equality were aware of the existence of a letter which vindicated the Garda Commissioner in respect of the issue of the recording of telephone calls, a matter that had been brought to the attention of the Taoiseach on the previous day.  During his Government briefing yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that he should have been made aware of the relevant information in this regard.  The expectation would be that if such information existed, it should have been made available to him.  However, it was not.<\/p><p>His briefing should have indicated that he should have been aware and he said as much yesterday at his Government briefing.  His expectation was that if that was the information then it would have been made available to him but it was not.  The Minister and his Secretary General sat at the meeting while the Taoiseach asked the Minister's Secretary General to meet the then Commissioner Callinan and effectively summarily dismiss him.<\/p><p> It is not conceivable that the Commissioner did not remind the Secretary General that he had sent him a letter which set out clearly the timeline, the chain of events and how the Commissioner had dealt with the recordings.  It is not conceivable that the Secretary General, if he had not seen the letter at that stage or was not aware of it because of the explanation he gave in his briefing, would not have been aware of it after his meeting with Martin Callinan.  It is not conceivable, notwithstanding the concerns of the Minister and the Taoiseach about the use of mobile telephones, that the Secretary General would not have made a call to the Minister on his return journey from the Garda Commissioner to the Minister and the Taoiseach to indicate that there was a document in existence which set out clearly the process followed by the Garda Commissioner.  That process clearly sets out a defence that he had against his dismissal.<\/p><p> Other information has come into the public domain which suggests that the Garda Commissioner contacted the Secretary General of the Department the following day to see if anything had changed.  What was it?  What message had he given the Secretary General on his return to the city centre which created an expectation in the mind of the Commissioner that minds of the Minister and the Taoiseach or those of the so-called members of the Cabinet had changed?  According to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, they were not even informed.  How might their minds have been changed had some information that was already available come to bear?<\/p><p> Will the Minister help me to understand why I have got it wrong, if that is his contention?  My belief is that the Garda Commissioner was sacked on a trumped-up charge to the effect that somehow he had done something wrong in respect of the recordings that go back decades.  In truth, the Taoiseach, together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, sacked him for his handling of the whistleblower issue, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission issue and other related matters.  The fact is the Minister will not confess up to that.  He cannot 'fess up to it because if he did he would have to do the honourable thing.  If the Minister was not prepared to do the honourable thing then his colleagues in government from the Labour Party would have no choice but to force him out.  However, they are happy to hide behind the weak defence that the Minister has presented as well as the trumped-up charge.<\/p><p> We talk about the Bailey case and people being fitted-up for crimes that they did not or may not have committed.  The Garda Commissioner has been fitted up for a crime that he had nothing whatsoever to do with.  He did his duty and he did it well.  He provided the information to the Minister but the Minister has still gone ahead.  The Minister is not prepared to accept the facts or even give credit to the work that this man has done for over many decades.  It is shameful and I believe in time the Minister will be found out for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200046#TT03500","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396452300,"counter":892,"content":"<p>There is ten minutes left in this slot, with five minutes for each Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200047#UU00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1396452300,"counter":893,"content":"<p>Several of the Minister's backbenchers have said tonight that this debate is about personality.

The issues that have emerged in recent months on penalty points, the GSOC and Garda tapes have become so confusing and there is such a tangled web at this stage.  Perhaps the management of these issues has perpetuated that confusion deliberately.<\/p><p>  We are led to believe that the improper recording of telephone conversations at certain Garda stations exploded as an issue on Sunday, 23 March when the Attorney General briefed the Taoiseach and the suggestion was that it was something new or that there was a dramatic new revelation which had the potential to lead to the appalling vista of the doors of Irish prisons being opened up, with rapists and murderers walking free onto our streets.  This issue was urgent and grave to the extent that the Taoiseach felt the need to dispatch the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Garda Commissioner's home, without consulting the Minister, to convey those sentiments to him.<\/p><p>  The problem with all of that is the Attorney General, who advises the Government, had been aware of the Garda telephone tape recording issue since the previous November.  There has been precious little commentary on that.  She was briefed by the Garda Commissioner in November last year.  I am led to the conclusion that all of this is about political expediency.  We have an Attorney General from the Labour Party family.  We have a Fine Gael Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Fine Gael message to the Labour Party in recent days has been quite clear: if the Labour Party comes looking for the head of the Minister for Justice and Equality, then the Labour Party had better be prepared to sacrifice the Attorney General as well.

He was backed up by a succession of Ministers in the following days.  Of course, the sacrificial lamb would be none other than the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality was sent to the home of the former Commissioner, Martin Callinan, to raise an issue that the Attorney General knew all about since the previous November and which the Department of Justice and Equality had known about for the previous two weeks.  The Commissioner was told, apparently, that there was grave concern at Cabinet level about this issue, despite the fact that the Cabinet was not even aware of it until the following morning, by which time the Commissioner, Martin Callinan, had bowed to be inevitable and resigned.  The Commissioner knew well the nature of the code of the visit from the Secretary General of the Department to his house after hours.  The code was that the Government had lost confidence in the Garda Commissioner and that he had to go.  He did go.  There has been much playing with words in recent days to the effect that the letter was not received by the Minister or was not furnished to him.  However, the content and the core message was indeed delivered and that has been confirmed.<\/p><p>  The Minister's colleagues will go through the motions of voting confidence in him this evening.  However, I submit that they do not have confidence in him.  His days are numbered because they know well that he is now a serious political liability for this coalition.  The Minister should ask himself why the Taoiseach bypassed him for a critical a 48-hour period when this issue was coming to a head.  The Minister was absolutely and utterly bypassed because, I believe, the Taoiseach does not have full confidence in the Minister, nor do the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who have passed a motion of no confidence in an unprecedented way at the Garda Representative Association, GRA conference.<\/p><p>  A more concerning development for the Government is not the lack of confidence in the Minister but the Taoiseach's credibility and authority, which has been undermined fundamentally by his handling of this issue.  When the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, came out and made his comments to the effect that the Commissioner should withdraw the &quot;disgusting&quot; remark he was slapped down in a very public way by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach said that Minister's should raise those concerns at Cabinet level but his request was not acceded to.  It was blatantly ignored by a line of Ministers in the following days who repeated that call for the Garda Commissioner to withdraw the remark.  The reality is that considerable political capital has now been extended to protect the Minister and his colleagues know all about it.  Anyway, the fundamental question which has not yet been answered is why the Garda Commissioner felt the need to resign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200047#UU00500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1396452300,"counter":896,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200047#UU00600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1396452300,"counter":897,"content":"<p>Why was he forced to go?

It is important to put the matter in context while we are discussing this motion of no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We need only think back a short period when the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, made his public comments at a road safety conference.  He said that the whistleblowers were distinguished.  Not long before that the Minister for Justice and Equality had been asked on numerous occasions to withdraw his remarks on non-co-operation in the O'Mahoney investigation.  The Commissioner was under pressure given his use of the word \"disgusting\" at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting.<\/p><p>  What happened was that the Garda Commissioner was minded to withdraw the &quot;disgusting&quot; remark made at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting but he was advised by the Department of Justice and Equality that this would not be the best course of action.  I am keen to know whether the Minister ever advised the Commissioner on whether he should withdraw the remark.  Did the Minister ever have a conversation with the Commissioner about this particular issue with regard to his performance at the Committee of Public Accounts?  They were tied to the hip on this particular issue.<\/p><p>Not only were the Minister and the Commissioner tied to the hip on the issue of the whistleblowers, but that was also the case on the issue of GSOC and a number of incidents that came to the public's attention over a period of time.<\/p><p> It is amazing that consistent briefings from sources close to Government and even some Ministers, which appeared again on the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today, have accused An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of perverting the course of justice and destroying evidence, namely, the tapes.  Even the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, made this allusion last week.  To try to save the Minister's skin, the Government has decided to denigrate the position of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p> The timelines are critical, as are the process and the question of why the Minister was not consulted, but a definite fact is that the Taoiseach was informed on the Sunday night of problems regarding a particular case that would have broader implications.  He decided to act because he knew that the political pressure had become almost unbearable and that some head needed to fall.  The Attorney General was implicated.  She was not only consulted by departmental officials, but also by the Garda Commissioner, who informed her of the issue of the tapes last November.  If not, then the D&aacute;il has been misled in recent days by the leader of the Minister's party, the Taoiseach.  The Attorney General was informed last November, a working group was established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there were constant discussions between the Garda and officials in the Minister's Department.<\/p><p> The Minister has made many claims about his ability.  He sent out a 53-page document on his achievements.  I am beginning to think that if he sent out a list of his failures, it would be even longer.  He has undermined any credibility in the notion that a Minister should take responsibility and accept that if he or she has done wrong or acted in a way unbefitting of the office, he or she should resign honourably.<\/p><p> The bottom line is that the Minister has consistently undermined the whistleblowers and two Deputies for cheap political gain.  He must get up every morning, look himself in the mirror and decide whether the Garda Commissioner was sacrificed to keep the Government intact.  The Labour Party, which is consistently absent when issues of confidence in the Minister are being discussed, knew full well that, if it came-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200047#UU01000","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396452900,"counter":902,"content":"<p>The Deputy was absent for an hour this day last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200048#VV00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1396452900,"counter":903,"content":"<p>-----looking for his head, someone on its side would have to fall.

The Government's amendment to the motion, which lists his legislative achievements, his successes in the battle against crime and his reforming zeal, is testimony to this.  Most of the difficulties in the justice area in recent months arose from incidents that occurred when Fianna F&aacute;il was in office.  In this respect, Fianna F&aacute;il has performed a major conjuring trick through which the people who caused the mess are blameless and the man who is cleaning it up is supposed to be at fault.<\/p><p>  Several inquiries are in place to deal with the issues that have been debated in the Chamber in recent months.  When the reports come to hand, they will be fully debated in the House.  While all of these matters are important and must be fully investigated and those lessons that need to be learned must be learned, they are of a different order of priority than the latest revelations of conversations of telephone calls to and from Garda stations being recorded, a practice that occurred over a period of at least 20 years and on a widespread basis.  Even before the commission of inquiry begins its work, it is clear that this revelation is a crystalising event and that Garda structures and systems must be changed radically and quickly.<\/p><p>  This is why, on the proposal of the Taoiseach at last week's Cabinet meeting, a decision was taken to establish an independent policing authority.

Issues such as the legal basis for taping conversations and the privacy issues that arise may also require a legislative, if not a constitutional, response.<\/p><p>  This matter is not only confined to Ireland.  A number of high-profile incidents in the past 12 months have underlined the importance of an adequate response.  Employees of the <i>News of the World<\/i> accessed the telephones of many citizens in the UK.  One aspect of that matter is being decided in a high-profile case before the courts in London.  Mr. Edward Snowden's allegations are a recurring theme in the media.

The Boston College tapes also raise a series of issues that Sinn F&eacute;in might see fit to address in the D&aacute;il in due course.<\/p><p>  My main point is that, while the issue of establishing a policing authority is of paramount importance and the Government must set about that task forthwith, other issues will arise.

When challenged on that, she claimed that she did not believe anything that the Government stated on this issue.  Contrast that with her total belief in the statement from her leader that he was never a member of the IRA and that he had nothing to do with the Jean McConville disappearance or the other people who disappeared when the Boston tapes, to which I have referred, have fully recorded his place in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200048#VV02100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1396452900,"counter":922,"content":"<p>Sectarian murders in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200048#VV02200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1396452900,"counter":923,"content":"<p>We have just heard from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who opened his contribution by saying that Fianna F&aacute;il was going for the man, not the ball before he had a go at our party.

What does it say about the Taoiseach's confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality that he did not discuss the matter with the Minister immediately as well, once he became aware of it?<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, we have seen obfuscation in every attempt to try to get the Minister out of the hole in which he finds himself.  Meanwhile, the number of inquiries and commissions ratchet up to the current number of four.  Alongside this, there is the issue of the letter and when the Minister became aware of it.  Very careful language has been used to cloud whether the Minister knew on the Monday or was briefed on what was in the letter and the fact that the Garda Commissioner had communicated it to his Department two weeks beforehand.  Despite that, on the basis of the content referred to in that letter, the Taoiseach asked the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to make known to the Garda Commissioner his dissatisfaction with how the issue was handled.  The Taoiseach said in the House yesterday that he should have known about that letter.  It is incomprehensible that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, when engaging with his Secretary General and his officials would not ask questions such as, &quot;Did we know about this before?&quot; or &quot;Has the Garda Commissioner ever asked us about this?&quot;, or would not have checked and thought it relevant that the Attorney General knew about it since the previous November, which is a significant factor as well with regard to how the Taoiseach has confidence in her and in the way the Government handled the issue.

However, every Deputy in this Chamber has received hate mail, so it is not relevant to this debate.  The Taoiseach decided to insert it this morning.<\/p><p>  Almost a year ago we tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister.  In the usual fashion the Minister came into the Chamber and described the opposition Deputies who spoke as character assassins.  What about the whistleblowers and the members of GSOC?  What about the confidential recipient, the Garda Commissioner and the two Independent Deputies behind me?  Those were attempted character assassinations by the Minister and the Government and by the silence of the Deputies opposite.  They are the character assassins.  It is a case of everybody else except them.<\/p><p>  Every opportunity has been afforded to the Government tonight and last night to address the issue of the departure of the former Garda Commissioner, but it has steadfastly refused to deal with his sacking.  It is worthwhile to remind the Irish public of his career.  He joined the force in 1973 and rose to the ranks of sergeant, inspector, superintendent, chief superintendent, assistant commissioner, deputy commissioner and Garda Commissioner.  The Government extended his term as Garda Commissioner.  He led the fight against organised crime, subversives and the IRA.  The Government reached for him at every opportunity as a positive example.  However, none of the government speakers in his or her contribution last night or tonight addressed why he was sacked and why he had to go prematurely.  Shame on them.  He was an outstanding public servant for 41 years and the Government extended his term, but none of the government speakers could address the elephant in the room.  In fairness, Deputy Michelle Mulherin was the only speaker who could bring herself to do it.  Yes, he made a mistake when he used the remark &quot;disgusting&quot;, but his loyalty to the Minister and to the Government in that regard cost him his job.  That is the point.<\/p><p>  This morning, during Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach continued to say he had grave concerns about the telephone recording.  They may be grave in respect of the Bailey case, but there has not been a queue outside the High Court petitioning for miscarriages of justice.  The rest of the graveness has not been explained; the Taoiseach has not taken the opportunity to explain it.  It is quite clear that the Taoiseach betrayed the former Garda Commissioner and that he was involved in shafting him, but he kept the Minister, Deputy Shatter, out of the loop.<\/p><p>The Government decided that a body had to be thrown under the bus, as it were, so they grabbed the Garda Commissioner and threw him under the bus.  People are asking who will be next, because there will be someone next if we go by the pattern of events.  The Taoiseach appointed the Minister and he is responsible for him, yet he chose not to involve the Minister in any of the major discussions when we follow through on the timeline of events.  Is that a vote of confidence?  I think it is not by his actions.<\/p><p> I do not know where the lads in the Labour Party and Fine Gael back benches stand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200049#WW00800","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396454100,"counter":938,"content":"<p>What about the ladies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200050#XX00200","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1396454100,"counter":939,"content":"<p>We all know what is in it for the leaders of Fine Gael.
