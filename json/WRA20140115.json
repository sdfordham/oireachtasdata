The violence, which erupted in the capital Juba on 15 December last, has spread very quickly and is now affecting most of the country, displacing more than 200,000 people, including some 60,000 seeking shelter in UN peacekeeping bases in the country. <\/p><p>  On 2  January last the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, issued a statement on behalf of the EU which called for an immediate ceasefire, with effective monitoring to spare the people of South Sudan any further suffering.  The statement appealed to all parties to allow access for humanitarian workers and observers and also encouraged immediate peace talks. <\/p><p>  Ireland is working closely with our EU partners to monitor and co-ordinate efforts in response to the unfolding political and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan.  The EU is supporting ongoing mediation efforts by the African Union and The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).  The peace talks, which are taking place in Addis Ababa, are vitally important and it is imperative that a negotiated solution is found as a matter of urgency.  The EU&rsquo;s Special Representative to the region, along with EU Ambassadors, are also working to bring about a peaceful solution to the crisis.  I look forward to discussing the latest situation in South Sudan with my colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council next Monday, when we will have an opportunity to consider possible further measures in response to the unfolding crisis.    <\/p><p>  Ireland provided &euro;4 million in humanitarian funding to South Sudan in 2013.  Of this, a total of &euro;2.5 million has been disbursed to the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund for South Sudan.  In addition, over &euro;1.5 million in funding has been disbursed through NGOs to meet humanitarian needs across the country in 2013. <\/p><p>  Two airlifts totalling 40 tonnes of emergency supplies, with a value of &euro;400,000 have been dispatched to South Sudan from our pre-positioned stocks in Accra, Ghana.  These supplies consist mainly of blankets, Jerry Cans, Tarpaulins, Kitchen sets and Mosquito nets.  In addition, the European Union is making &euro;50 million available to respond to the humanitarian crisis.  Our funding is saving lives.<\/p><p>  Ireland is also addressing the issue of security in South Sudan.  There are four defence personnel serving with the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) there, providing important technical training on bomb disposal techniques to local police.  Three members of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps were deployed to UN agencies in South Sudan in 2013.  A further deployment to UNICEF in South Sudan is scheduled for later this month.  <\/p><p>  My Department is also providing consular assistance to Irish citizens in South Sudan through our Embassies in Addis Ababa and Kampala and the Consular Crisis Section in Dublin and our travel advice has been updated to advise against travel there.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Access","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[1434\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress and support Ireland has given in terms of establishing humanitarian corridors to allow aid to get into Syria; the extent to which his Department will step up its efforts to support Syrian refugees and the setting up of humanitarian corridors in response to the barrel-bombing of more than 500 people in Aleppo since 15 December which included a high number of children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The protracted and tragic crisis in Syria and in neighbouring countries has resulted in unprecedented levels of humanitarian need, requiring a sustained and urgent response from the international community.  There are now nearly 9 million people who are in need of immediate life saving support.  This figure includes 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, and more than 2.3 million Syrians who have fled the violence to take refuge in neighbouring countries.  <\/p><p>  I am acutely aware that there are many people inside Syria who have not received any assistance in a long period of time.  While reaching these populations under siege is an urgent priority, the fact remains that humanitarian access across Syria is exceptionally difficult as a result of increasing disregard by armed groups on both sides of the conflict of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.  Recent attacks on civilians as witnessed in Aleppo, in addition to abductions of humanitarian personnel, clearly illustrate this highly risky operating environment and shrinking humanitarian space.<\/p><p>  The question of establishing humanitarian corridors within Syria is a complex one, in that to do so would likely necessitate the provision of foreign military protection to humanitarian convoys. This could have the unwelcome and unintended result of placing already vulnerable civilians and aid workers at further risk.  We therefore share the caution of the United Nations&rsquo; humanitarian agencies, the International Red Cross\/Red Crescent Movement and many of our other partners in respect of the calls for military intervention in support of humanitarian action and believe that negotiated access remains the most effective approach.   <\/p><p>  Ireland supports UN Under Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, Valerie Amos, in her call for humanitarian pauses to ensure safe and unhindered passage of humanitarian conveys into hard-to-reach areas.  We must consider alternative forms of aid delivery, including cross border delivery of assistance which complies with the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality, impartiality and humanity.  While the United Nations Security Council Presidential Statement of 2nd October was a welcome and necessary step, as the humanitarian situation continues to worsen, full political weight now needs to be brought to bear through the Security Council to ensure its implementation.  Ireland is disappointed with the negligible impact of this initiative on the ground, with humanitarians still being denied access to populations in need.  <\/p><p>  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to advocate for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort at all relevant international fora.  Ireland is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a <i>per capita<\/i> basis, having already provided over &euro;14 million in assistance since the crisis began.  My colleague, the Minister for Trade and Development Joe Costello, T.D. is today attending the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and the region in Kuwait where he has announced Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of &euro;12 million in support to the humanitarian relief effort over the course of 2014 which will bring our total assistance to over &euro;26 million.  <\/p><p>  The Government has matched its material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access.  We have called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians.  We continue to stress the need for a comprehensive political solution to this crisis, every day that passes leads to further suffering and the international humanitarian response can only do so much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":17,"content":"<p>Question No. 12 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[1435\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent of his engagement with the American authorities on the continued imprisonment of the Cuban five, only one of whom has been released; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers of the Cuban citizens imprisoned in the US.<\/p><p>  As this is a bilateral consular issue between the US and the Cuban authorities, the Government has no standing in the matter. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with Cuba continue to be positive and I look forward to the further development of relations in the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[1475\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will contact the Egyptian Government to protest against the imprisonment of a number of pro-democracy activists (details supplied) and others who were recently imprisoned for unauthorised protests to demand their immediate release; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[1476\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500050#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the intervention the Irish Government had made or is planning to make with the Egyptian Government to ensure pro-democracy activists are not penalised or imprisoned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 26 together.<b><\/b><\/p><p>  I have made clear Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for an urgent return to democracy and the constitutional order in Egypt and the lifting of all unwarranted restrictions on Egyptian civil society and Egyptian citizens.  <\/p><p>  I have also personally intervened in the case of our own citizens from the Halawa family, seeking to ensure that they receive fair and transparent justice from the Egyptian authorities.  <\/p><p>  Ireland stands firmly with the public statement made by the EU's High Representative, Cathy Ashton, who stated on behalf of the EU on 23 December that she was concerned about the guilty verdict, the prison sentences and the financial penalty handed down by a court in Egypt against political activists Ahmed Maher, a founder of the April 6 Movement, Ahmed Douma and Mohammed Adel and hoped that these sentences could be reviewed in an appeals process. <\/p><p>  I strongly support her statement and the concerns expressed by both the EU and the UN Secretary General on recent legislative restrictions imposed on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression in Egypt.

If we want to be effective in addressing human rights issues with countries, we must do it in an appropriate way and at the right opportunity, so that our concerns are taken seriously and acted upon. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":46,"content":"<p>Question No. 22 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[1438\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza; that Israel is deepening the crisis due to its continued blockade and bombing of Gaza; and if he will raise the issue with the Israeli authorities.","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[1265\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will condemn the recent aerial bombardment of Gaza by the Israeli authorities; if he will campaign within the EU for an ending of the favourable treatment of Israel by calling for the cessation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and an ending of their involvement in Horizon 2020.","asker":"1015","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[1431\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the discussions he has had with his EU counterparts following the recent air strikes carried out by Israel in the Gaza Strip; his views on the need to end the EU-Israel Association Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[55313\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the representations he has made to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to lift the blockade on Gaza following the severe flooding in northern Gaza.","asker":"954","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[55314\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the assistance he is giving to the people of Gaza following the recent severe flooding in northern Gaza.","asker":"954","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 29, 30, 38 and 39 together.<b><\/b><\/p><p>  In relation to the overall humanitarian situation in Gaza, the impact of the blockade, and the humanitarian assistance provided by Ireland in response, I would refer to my detailed reply to Question 28 (ref 53172\/13) on 11 December last.<\/p><p>  Ireland, both nationally and through the EU, will continue to draw attention to the unacceptable situation in Gaza, to call for an end to the blockade of Gaza, and to call upon all parties in the region to give greater consideration to the impact of their policies on the people of Gaza.  This applies especially to Israel, but also to all other actors, including Hamas and other groups in Gaza, and to Egypt.<\/p><p>  On 25 December Israeli warplanes dropped four bombs on Gaza, on sites claimed to be military targets, following the killing on 24 December by a sniper in Gaza of a civilian worker in Israel who was repairing the border fence.  Three people in Gaza were reportedly killed, including a child.<\/p><p>  Although on this occasion relatively brief, such mini cycles of violence are recurring, tragic, and futile.  I have consistently condemned both Israeli strikes on Gaza which incur civilian casualties, but also repeated attacks into Israel which intentionally seek to kill Israeli civilians and are indifferent to subsequent retaliation by Israel into Gaza.  I do not accept the view that one killing justifies another, but nor do I think it is helpful to focus on one side only, and simply ignore the fact that violence is being exchanged in both directions.<\/p><p>  I repeat &ndash; again &ndash; my call on all parties to refrain from such actions.<\/p><p>  I have dealt many times in the House with the question of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.  Such agreements, which are in place with most of the EU&rsquo;s Mediterranean neighbours, are not a reward for good behaviour, they are the means by which the EU itself has chosen to structure its relations with its neighbours.  I do not propose to seek the suspension of the agreement, and I have made it clear that if I were to do so, there would be no prospect whatever of achieving this, and the only effect would be to lessen Ireland&rsquo;s influence on this issue at EU level.  The same applies to Israel&rsquo;s participation in Horizon 2020, which covers co-operation in research and development, to the mutual benefit of both parties, and is confined to entities operating within the internationally recognised borders of Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Strategy","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB01125"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[1472\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if work has commenced on devising a new trade strategy; if he will indicate the number of staff and sections of his Department involved in this; and if he will indicate the input of Ireland's embassies in the process, on account of their valuable expertise and knowledge of foreign economies and markets.","asker":"1110","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>On 17 January 2013, the Government decided to initiate a short focused review of the Government&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy which covers the period to 2015.

The drafting of the review has taken account of detailed input from Departments, State agencies, the Embassy network and Local Market Teams in priority markets, chaired by our Ambassadors and including State agency personnel overseas.

There was disappointment with Ukraine&rsquo;s decision in November 2013 to postpone signing the Association Agreement with the EU, which together with the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area was the most ambitious offer made to any partner by the EU.  The Council agreed on keeping the door open and on the need for meaningful dialogue with all stakeholders in Ukraine to find a negotiated solution to the political stalemate following the demonstrations.   <\/p><p>  Our discussions in Brussels continued over lunch with the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov.  The situation in Ukraine was a major topic, although we also considered the EU&rsquo;s wider relationship with Russia in advance of the next EU-Russia summit.  Minister Lavrov defended Russia's approach and was critical of the EU's Eastern Partnership process.  He argued that the process in Ukraine was becoming too politicised and that Russia would respect any sovereign choice made by Ukraine which, I believe, is a fundamental condition for achieving a durable political solution to the crisis there.  Ministers sent a strong message that Russia&rsquo;s action towards Ukraine and indeed other Eastern Partnership countries is unacceptable.  <\/p><p>  For my part, I also availed of the opportunity to raise with Minister Lavrov my concern over Russia's LGBTI-related legislation and with the broader human rights situation in the Russian Federation.  <\/p><p>  I should note that the situation in Ukraine was also considered by the European Council at its meeting on 19-20 December after which a statement was issued underlining the Union&rsquo;s readiness to sign the Association Agreement, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, with Ukraine, as soon as Ukraine is ready.  Calling for a democratic solution to the political crisis that would meet the aspirations of the Ukrainian people, the Heads of State and Government emphasised the right of all sovereign States to make their own foreign policy decisions without undue external pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":60,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":61,"content":"<p>Question No. 27 answered with Question No. 21.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[51929\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to ratify the Antarctic Treaty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>The question of Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Antarctic Treaty and related agreements comprising the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) has been examined in some detail by the Government and Offices concerned.<\/p><p>  While the objectives and achievements of the ATS are of considerable importance and the commitment of the signatories is commendable, the direct benefits to Ireland of ratification would be relatively minor.

During our term, we are actively working to add value to the work of the Council and strengthen the institution itself.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to membership of the HRC is guided by the pledges and commitments made during our campaign to secure election, which reflect our well-established human rights priorities.  These include the following:<\/p><p>- Defending the universality of human rights; <\/p><p>- Freedom of expression, (including on the internet); <\/p><p>- Freedom of religion or belief;<\/p><p>- Combating all forms of discrimination, including against LGBTI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex) persons;  <\/p><p>- The human rights situation in the Middle East; <\/p><p>- Strengthening the UN human rights treaty body system;<\/p><p>- The promotion and protection of human rights defenders;<\/p><p>- The promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society;<\/p><p>- Women&rsquo;s rights, combating discrimination and gender-based violence. <\/p><p>  We are also highlighting the importance of ensuring that human rights considerations underpin all areas of development &ndash; with a particular focus on gender equality, health, education and combating hunger.  <\/p><p>  The Human Rights Council meets in March, June and September every year.  Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first six months of 2013, which encompassed the March and June sessions of the Human Rights Council.  As Presidency, Ireland played a highly active and visible role in the HRC as part of the Joint EU Team, together with the EU Delegation in Geneva.  <\/p><p>  During both sessions, the joint EU Team led in the preparation of draft resolutions and the conduct of negotiations on a number of EU priority initiatives, namely on DPRK, Belarus, Myanmar\/Burma, freedom of religion or belief and rights of the child.  Ireland also worked in tandem with the EU Delegation to represent the EU at negotiations on resolutions relating to Sri Lanka, Mali, Syria, Libya, Eritrea, Middle East, human rights defenders, combating religious intolerance and illicit funds.  Ireland also negotiated four further resolutions on behalf of the EU, on national human rights institutions, discrimination against women, cultural rights and foreign debt.<\/p><p>  At the March session, I personally delivered the general statement on behalf of the European Union on a number of country situations and thematic priorities.  In addition, Ireland delivered a further nine statements on behalf of the EU during the session, as well as seventeen separate introductory statements, general comments and explanations of vote during the final two days, when action was taken on the draft resolutions.  <\/p><p>  During the March session, Ireland co-sponsored 24 draft resolutions, including resolutions on the human rights of persons with disabilities; human rights of persons from minorities; social, economic and cultural rights; freedom of religion or belief; peaceful protests; torture; human rights defenders; self-determination of Palestinians; Israeli settlements; the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK); Myanmar\/Burma; Iran; and Syria.  We were also co-signatories to cross-regional statements on Syria, Bahrain, International Women&rsquo;s Day, Reprisals against Human Rights Defenders and the Universal Periodic Review.<\/p><p>  At the June session, Ireland co-sponsored 18 draft resolutions, including resolutions on Cote D&rsquo;Ivoire, Central African Republic, Guinea, Somalia, Eritrea, and Belarus, as well as resolutions on violence against women, discrimination against women, internally displaced persons, and trafficking in persons.  Ireland was also co-signatory to five cross-regional statements, on sexual orientation and gender identity; female genital mutilation, child, early and forced marriage; equal political participation; and on promoting human rights, including the right to the highest attainable standard of health, through sport, physical activity and play.<\/p><p>  In the September session, Ireland took the lead within the Human Rights Council on two important new initiatives.  First, as part of our commitment to ensuring that our human rights priorities and development programme are mutually reinforcing, Ireland led on a resolution on preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five which was adopted by consensus on 26 September 2013.  6.6 million children under the age of five die each year, mainly from preventable and treatable causes.  This resolution focuses on how the HRC can act in elaborating a human rights based approach to this issue and support the much needed engagement of the human rights community in the ongoing efforts to strengthen accountability for children&rsquo;s health.  As a result of the adoption of this resolution, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is elaborating technical guidance, in close consultation with the World Health Organisation drawing on the particular expertise of that agency, and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including Governments.  Irish Aid is providing support through the World Health Organisation for the development of this technical guidance, which will be grounded in human rights principles, and will help national Ministries and other actors to design policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate preventable morbidity and mortality of children under five.  <\/p><p>  Ireland also took the lead on a new resolution on creating and maintaining a safe and enabling environment for civil society which was adopted on 27 September 2013.  Civil society actors have come under increasing pressure in many parts of the world in recent years.  In some countries, dialogue with civil society remains limited and the space for civil society engagement is narrow or shrinking.  Restrictive legislation and repressive practices in some countries have led to stigmatisation, harassment, and even criminalisation of civil society actors.  The resolution underlines the important contribution of civil society and calls on States to create and maintain a safe and enabling environment in which civil society can operate effectively.  It also provides for a panel discussion to be held during the March 2014 session of the Human Rights Council on the challenges facing States in their efforts to ensure space for civil society, and lessons learnt and good practice in this regard.  Subsequent to that discussion, Ireland intends to work with partner countries to develop a more substantive resolution on civil society space, which we hope to present to the Council in September 2014.  <\/p><p>  In addition to the initiatives referenced above, at the September 2013 session, Ireland co-sponsored 30 resolutions in total, on topics such as freedom of peaceful assembly and association, female genital mutilation, safety of journalists, equal political participation, reprisals, prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, older persons, as well as country-specific resolutions on Cambodia, Somalia, DRC, Yemen, and Syria.  Ireland delivered a total of 18 separate national statements during the general debate, panel discussions and interactive dialogues, including on human rights situations in a number of countries, such as Egypt, Syria, Sri Lanka, DPRK, Sudan, and Somalia.  We led a cross regional Joint Statement on preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five as a human rights concern.  Ireland was also a co-signatory to Joint Statements on Bahrain and on the safety of journalists, and raised important issues such as children affected by armed conflict, and the role of civil society in integrating gender perspectives in the work of the HRC.  <\/p><p>  Ireland engaged actively in the three meetings of the Human Rights Council Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review.  Under this mechanism, the human rights situation of all UN Member States is reviewed every 4.5 years.  The 15th session of the Working Group took place from 21 January to 1 February; the 16th session from 22 April to 3 May; and the 17th   session from 21 October to 1 November 2013.  A total of 42 states were reviewed during 2013.<\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to respond proactively to emerging human rights situations and themes, including emergency situations, and to play an active role in the Council&rsquo;s three yearly sessions (March, June and September) and in the UPR.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":69,"content":"<p>Question No. 32 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[1477\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the consular assistance given to date to a person (details supplied) with particular regard to the hearing which took place on 10 January, 2013 in the US; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[1609\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500051#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the actions his Department is taking in assisting a person (details supplied) following the granting of retrial by the Florida supreme court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 78 together. <\/p><p>  The person referred to by the Deputy holds dual American and Irish citizenship.

Exports in services to India grew by &euro;382 million to &euro;1, 413 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  Since 2012, the Irish Embassy and State Agencies in India have worked to a joint strategy which sets out agreed priorities for the bilateral relationship with India. <\/p><p>  This includes targets for increased trade, investment, tourism and education links between Ireland and India. The Embassy and Agencies work closely on implementing this strategy, regularly reviewing progress against agreed targets. The strategy focuses on India as a source of inward investment and on encouraging Irish business to investigate market opportunities in India. It also prioritises tourism and education to attract Indian nationals to Ireland and there has been strong growth in these sectors in recent years. <\/p><p>  The strategy also commits the Embassy and Agencies to combine resources where possible in order to maximise their combined impact in a market of 1.2 billion people. One example of this was a television advertising campaign concerning the Irish cricket team in late 2012. This was co-funded by the Embassy and Agencies and projected Ireland as a tourism, education and investment destination to an audience of millions. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Embassy regularly hosts events with or on behalf of Irish business and the State Agencies with a view to developing their network and client base within India. In 2013, several events were held on behalf of Ireland&rsquo;s food and beverage industries, the pharmaceutical sector, the bloodstock industry, hotel and tourism sector, aviation services and education, amongst others. <\/p><p>  In November 2013, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mr. Richard Bruton TD, led a trade and investment mission to India with the Embassy, EI and IDA.  42 Irish companies and Higher Education Institutions participated in the mission, which targeted sectors including technology, life sciences, financial services, engineering and education.  <\/p><p>  In 2013, Ireland&rsquo;s international education sector in India has shown strong results with a year on year 120% increase in visa applications to study in Ireland. The target is to double the number of Indian students studying in Ireland to 2, 000 by 2015, with a further ministerial education mission to India in planning for 2014.<\/p><p>While the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US and we must continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is strongly focused on the further development of trading partnerships with other important emerging markets.<\/p><p>  Following the launch of the Government&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, &lsquo;Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, 2010 - 2015&rsquo; in September 2010, and based on State agency priorities, a list of 27 priority markets were identified. Local Market Teams were established in each of these, headed by the Ambassador and consisting of representatives of the Embassy and relevant state agencies. These market teams submit annual market plans as well as six-monthly reports of activity, which are reviewed by the Export Trade Council, which I chair. <\/p><p>The exporting sector is vital to the health of the Irish economy. Enterprise Ireland reported in its 2013 end of year statement that its client companies now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy (16% of the total workforce). The Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland Trade Missions bringing client companies to key markets are strongly supported by my Department and the Embassy network. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s exports were &euro;182 billion in 2012, split almost evenly between goods and services, an increase of 5.5 percent on 2011. The growth in goods exports slowed to 0.7 percent on the previous year, but growth in services exports was strong at almost 11 percent. The tables annexed to this reply (using figures collated by Forf&aacute;s) show the main destinations of Irish goods and services exports over the last five years. While full year figures for 2013 are not yet available, these are expected to show a small decline in exports largely caused by the effects of the pharmaceutical &ldquo;patent cliff&rdquo; and weakness in established markets.<\/p><p><b>Annex:<\/b><\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Goods Exports by Destination<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Destination<\/th><th>2012 (&euro;

Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), clear systems have been put in place to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible. Ireland has and will continue to play our part in ensuring these reforms are implemented, and that responses are timely and effective, and meet the most critical, immediate needs. <\/p><p>  The steps taken to strengthen humanitarian response include the provision by Ireland and other donors of predictable emergency response funding.  However, disasters on the scale of the earthquake in Haiti, the famine in the Horn of Africa, the conflict in Syria and, more recently, the Typhoon in the Philippines and conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan continue to challenge the humanitarian system.  For such crises, international pledging conferences are often considered necessary in order to generate additional donor funding. <\/p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance over two years was pledged by the international community in response to the crisis.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, just $2.38 billion of this had actually been disbursed. For our part, we worked hard to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitments to the people of Haiti. By the end of 2012, our pledge of &euro;13 million had been honoured and exceeded, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million.  \t<\/p><p>  At a Ministerial mini-summit in New York in September 2011, An T&aacute;naiste pledged that &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance would be made available to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the Horn of Africa before the end of 2012. I am happy to report that this pledge has also been met, with almost &euro;12 million in funding provided by December 2012.  Similarly, at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013, I announced a commitment of &euro;4.7 million to support the provision of humanitarian assistance in Syria and its neighbouring countries. By the end of 2013, this pledge had been exceeded by over &euro;6.5 million, with a total of &euro;11.3 million in assistance provided throughout the course of the year. We can be very proud of our record on delivery of our pledges.<\/p><p>  Ireland, as one of the founding members of the Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) initiative, takes seriously our commitment to act as a responsible and accountable donor. Equally, we are committed to the full implementation of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, which clearly articulates the EU and its Member States&rsquo; commitment to ensuring that humanitarian aid pledges are transformed into commitments and disbursements in a timely way, and are clearly linked to the assessment of needs. <\/p><p>  We are responding to large-scale and sudden onset emergencies. Ireland has a long-standing focus and commitment to so-called forgotten crises; ongoing, protracted and under-funded humanitarian crises such as those in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Western Sahara and the countries of the Sahel. These crises very often do not make the evening news, or fall off the political and humanitarian agendas of the international community. Alongside the provision of predictable funding to such crises, we take every opportunity, including throughout the course of our EU Presidency in 2013, to bring the attention of other donors to these situations. <\/p><p>  In order to promote the importance of ensuring that donor aid pledges are credible, achievable, and properly monitored, the OECD has published a &lsquo;Recommendation on Good Pledging Practice&rsquo;. This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries and is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.  Ireland strongly supports this OECD initiative and will continue to use all appropriate fora to urge our fellow donors to ensure that they meet their humanitarian commitments in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500055#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":203,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":204,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500055#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[1776\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500055#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which he and the international community continue to positively influence the situation in Syria with particular reference to the need to protect the civilian population and address the widespread human rights abuses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>Ending the conflict is Syria is a critical objective for the Government and the wider international community.

These negotiations are continuing, with seven chapters now opened for negotiations, of which two chapters have been provisionally closed.

In December, the General Affairs Council   agreed that it would come back to the issue of beginning accession negotiations, on the basis of an update by the European Commission on the further implementation of reforms in Macedonia. <\/p><p>  The EU is also engaged in a High Level Dialogue with Albania on key priorities for reform, in particular reform of the judiciary, the fight against organised crime and corruption and the protection of human rights and anti-discrimination policies.  With regard to granting candidate status to Albania, the General Affairs Council last December agreed that <i>&ldquo;on the understanding that Albania continues to build on the encouraging progress made so far, the Council looks forward to a decision regarding granting candidate status to Albania in June 2014, subject to endorsement by the European Council.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>  Negotiations began in autumn 2013 on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and Kosovo.

The General Affairs Council in December noted its serious concern that the EU integration process in Bosnia has stalled due to a lack of political will on the part of the Bosnia and Herzegovina political leadership. The EU continues to facilitate dialogue among the Bosnian leadership aimed at reaching agreement on the way forward, as well as working with Bosnia through the Structured Dialogue on Justice issues. <\/p><p>  Overall, enlargement remains a key policy of the European Union.

This approach encompasses political and diplomatic engagement, development cooperation programming, humanitarian assistance, and support for peacekeeping operations.  <\/p><p>  The top ten poorest countries in the world are in Africa.  The UN Human Development Index classifies Niger as the poorest, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Guinea and Burundi.  In an effort to help the continent to confront these far-reaching challenges, we allocate approximately 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance to Africa.  Ireland is comitted to supporting the recovery efforts and successful transition of countries emerging from conflict or significant and protracted humanitarian crises. The recent announcement that Sierra Leone will become one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s nine Key Partner Countries is testament to this commitment. Ireland will further strengthen its support for long-term reconstruction and development in Sierra Leone, working in close collaboration with the authorities there and other partners such as United Nations agencies and NGOs. <\/p><p>  The progress in African countries, particularly those emerging from conflict, and the approach the EU takes to promote peace and security and development, is discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  I have participated in some of the discussions on the latest developments in a number of Africa's most troubled regions -the Great Lakes, Somalia and Mali. <\/p><p>  The EU is the largest donor to African countries providing approximately &euro;21 billion in assistance annually.  Together with other donor countries, Ireland has worked particularly closely with the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to put in place new systems to improve the way in which aid is delivered and to ensure that coordination on the ground is improved through enhanced monitoring systems.  The EU, and Ireland as a bilateral donor provide very significant humanitarian support across Africa, in close cooperation with regional bodies, including the African Union. <\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made on regional security with the support of EU Common Security and Defence Policy missions. Somalia is a good example of the EU&rsquo;s Comprehensive Approach in action, with the Horn of Africa Strategy located within the wider framework for EU action in Africa. One element of this approach is Operation Atalanta, the EU&rsquo;s first CSDP Maritime Mission which aims to protect World Food Program and merchant shipping transiting the Gulf of Aden against piracy. Another element is the EU&rsquo;s Military Training Mission which has been training Somali defence forces since 2010. Ireland has and will continue to deploy personnel to civilian and military EU and UN missions.<\/p><p>  Our aid programme is recognised as one of the best in the world. I am very conscious of the need to have a high level of assurance that our development assistance is fully accountable and that it makes a real difference to the lives of the world&rsquo;s poorest people, reaches those most in need and without interference.  <\/p><p>  All proposals for funding are rigorously appraised by our aid programme staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources.   All partners in receipt of Irish Aid funds are obliged to report regularly on the results being achieved.  The programmes are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts, as well as by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500055#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":219,"content":"<p>Question No. 96 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[1783\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500055#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community continue to respond to the development of the democratisation of Iran with particular reference to the need to eliminate human rights abuses and a recognition that the establishment of democratic principles can and will result in a commensurate lifting of economic restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>While there is more hope now of a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue, the Deputy&rsquo;s Question is a timely reminder that there remain very considerable human rights concerns in relation to Iran, which have generally speaking worsened over the last ten years.<\/p><p>  The new Government in Iran has made some welcome statements on improving the protection of human rights in Iran.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under existing legislation income tax is charged under Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of a number of sources of income, which are classified into five separate Cases.  Under this provision, rent received by landlords (both individuals and companies) from property in the State is chargeable to tax under Case V, while income from trading activity in the State is chargeable under Case I.<\/p><p>  In the case of trading activity, the law provides that taxable income is closely aligned to the accounting profit (subject to certain explicit prohibitions). In the case of rental activity, however, taxable income is the gross rent as reduced by a limited number of specified deductions as set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997.<\/p><p>These are:<\/p><p>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<\/p><p>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<\/p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;<\/p><p>- the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and <\/p><p>- payment of local authority rates. <\/p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.  These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.<\/p><p>  In relation to the provision of a deduction for local property tax, it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis but the manner in which this will happen has not been decided.  Any such change would have to be provided for by primary legislation.<\/p><p>  As the provisions relating to deductible expenses for rent purposes are specifically provided for in legislation, Revenue cannot allow deductions other than in accordance with the legislation and I cannot require them to do otherwise.  Any change to the range of deductible expenses would have to be dealt with by way of changes to the primary law. In that regard, however, apart from the intention to allow for a deduction for local property tax mentioned above, I have no plans to otherwise broaden the range of expenses deductible in relation to rental income or to remove the existing restriction on interest deductibility.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500056#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[55234\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500056#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a business can deduct the costs of petty theft of stock from a store against a tax bill; the rules for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that the starting point for determining the taxable profits of a business is the accounting profits of that business, calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP ).

The Revenue Commissioners have published guidelines to assist local authorities in identifying such accommodation.  All local authority residential properties which are liable to LPT will be in the lowest valuation band for the initial valuation period (2013 to 2016).

This decision is a matter for individual local authorities.<\/p><p>  I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, that under the current statutory basis for the charging of rent by local authorities for their dwellings, section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, housing authorities are responsible for determining the rents of their dwellings, subject to complying with broad principles laid down by his Department, notably that the rent payable should be related to income and that low-income households should pay a lower proportion of income in rent.  This current statutory basis does not provide for a specific levy or charge in respect of works or services provided otherwise than under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2013.

Any constituents who suffered losses through their dealings with Home Payments Limited should contact the liquidators for information on the repayment process.<\/p><p>  I, as Minister for Finance have no statutory role in relation to the resolution of the liquidation of this company. <\/p><p>  The Government is not in a position to compensate clients of this company for losses incurred due to the liquidation. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that, since the liquidation of that company, a new regulatory regime for debt management firms has been put in place under Section 59 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013. <\/p><p>  A debt management firm is defined as &ldquo;a person who for remuneration provides debt management services to one or more consumers, other than an excepted person&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  &lsquo;Debt management services&rsquo; are defined in the legislation as<\/p><p>&ldquo;(a) giving advice about the discharge of debts (in whole or in part), including advice about budgeting in connection with the discharge of debts,<\/p><p>(b) negotiating with a person&rsquo;s creditors for the discharge of the person&rsquo;s debts (in whole or in part), or<\/p><p>(c) any similar activity associated with the discharge of debts.&rdquo;<\/p><p>  Where debt management firms propose to receive client funds and make payments on behalf of clients to their creditors they may require a payment institution authorisation under the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 or a money transmission business authorisation under Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 (as amended) depending on their business model.  It is under these regimes that the appropriate protection for client funds is provided for. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500056#WRG02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Operations","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500056#WRG02450"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[55484\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500056#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to force banks and credit card companies, as part of their strategy to reduce credit card fraud and theft, to text the card holder after each transactions, thus making them aware instantly that their card has been used or abused.","asker":"1028","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>I have no plans to require banks and credit card companies to text the card holder after each transaction. <\/p><p>  According to the Irish Payment Service Organisation, there are approximately 300 million card transactions each year.

Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.

The VAT Rates Database is an integral part of the information provided on the Revenue website.  A key element to supporting voluntary compliance is the provision of up to date information.  As the Deputy is aware, the Irish VAT system has a number of rates and it is absolutely critical that Revenue provides the VAT Rates Database on their website. <\/p><p>  The recipient of a VAT invoice has an entitlement to an input credit only for the VAT shown on the invoice and only where the goods or services are used by him or her for the purpose of VATable supplies.  <\/p><p>  The rate of VAT on the supply of non-residential immovable goods is provided for in paragraph 15(1) of Schedule 3 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010; while the rate applicable to services consisting of the development of, and work on, non-residential immovable goods is provided for in paragraph 15(2) of Schedule 3.  In both cases the rate of VAT is 13.5%, provided in the latter case that the value of the goods supplied does not exceed two thirds of the total consideration for the service, excluding VAT.<\/p><p>  Tax legislation provides that Revenue may make such inquiries necessary to satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of statements or particulars submitted by taxpayers.  I am advised by Revenue that their overall approach to tackling compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following careful appraisal of the risk factors in each case.  The appropriate compliance intervention is the one considered to be the most effective in targeting the specific risk or risks identified, and to influence the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer.  This targeted approach is greatly supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including the Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling system REAP. <\/p><p>  Revenue has advised me that they do not consider it appropriate to publish the risk rules, or to always tell taxpayers why they have been selected for intervention, as it would prejudice the effectiveness of their compliance programmes.  All letters issued to a taxpayer or agent will, however, clearly indicate the nature of the Revenue intervention. <\/p><p>  It is a fundamental principle of self-assessment tax systems that returns filed by compliant taxpayers are accepted as the basis for computing tax liabilities.  Revenue facilitates taxpayers who discover errors after submission of the relevant tax returns and who wish to regularise the position.  Chapter Two of the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit provides a suite of opportunities for taxpayers who wish to regularise their tax and duty affairs.  These opportunities provide for very significant reduction in penalties and Revenue strongly recommends that taxpayers review their tax and duty affairs regularly. <\/p><p>  Where arising from compliance interventions by Revenue, defaults are discovered, legislation provides for the assessment of the tax underpaid, interest chargeable and the level of any penalties to be charged.   The mere presence of risk indicators in a case does not necessarily mean that there will be an additional tax lability.  Some risk indicators can be easily explained and do not require detailed examination.  Further information on the application of penalties is contained in Chapter Four of the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit.  Where the taxpayer does not agree that there is an additional tax liability the assessment may be appealed to the independent Appeal Commissioners. <\/p><p>  Lastly, Revenue has also advised that any taxpayer who is dissatisfied about how their particular case has been handled can avail of Revenue's Complaint and Review Procedures, details of which are set out in the attached . <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500057#WRHHHHH02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Relief Eligibility","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500057#WRHHHHH02950"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[1174\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500057#WRHHHHH03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount granted by way of mortgage interest relief in respect of principal private dwellings in each of the years 2010 to 2013; and the expected cost each year until the relief is withdrawn in 2017.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer of mortgage interest relief for principal private residences by way of tax relief at source (TRS) in the years 2010 to 2014 inclusive is as follows: <table><tr><th><i>Tax Year<\/i><\/th><th><i>Cost &euro;m<\/i><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>375<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>357<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>411<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> 2013*<\/td><td>353<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 (estimated)<\/td><td>350 <\/td><\/tr><\/table> *This figure is provisional and subject to revision.<\/p><p>  The estimate of &euro;350 million for 2014 is a revision of a previous estimate of &euro;400m based on firmer figures becoming available for 2013.

I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can causes to householders and businesses.  However, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals.  The issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting.<\/p><p>  The idea of making flood insurance compulsory has been considered.  However, it would mean that in areas where there was likely to be regular flooding, the cost of insurance would almost certainly be prohibitive and could make premiums unaffordable for policyholders in general.  <\/p><p>  On the question of legislation, the Government has also examined the introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain household insurance in respect of flooding from regular insurance bodies.  However, this approach was not considered financially viable because it was believed that over time it would incentivise industry to discontinue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.<\/p><p>  What the Government can do, however, is try to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible.  The Office of Public Works is committed to doing all it can to alleviate the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.<\/p><p>  Most of the damage arising from the recent stormy weather was in coastal counties in the West and South.  OPW, along with other relevant Depts, will be providing financial support to local authorities in relation to the repair of public infrastructure damaged in the storms.  In OPW's case the support will relate to damaged coastal flood defence structures such as rock armour revetments, sea walls.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of the provision of flood cover in areas where the OPW has carried out flood relief works, the OPW and the Irish Insurance Federation have been engaged in discussions to agree on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW or, in certain instances, by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.  There is agreement in principle but with some operational details to be finally sorted by the insurance companies.<\/p><p>  The outcome of these discussions means that the insurance industry will have a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will therefore be in a position to provide the necessary flood cover to householders in such areas.  <\/p><p>  In cases where individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance believe that they are being treated unfairly they can contact the Irish Insurance Federation which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums.  In Budget 2014 the Minister announced that tax relief for medical insurance premiums will be restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured. Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.<\/p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and is estimated to be &euro;500 million in 2013.  Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies.  Against this background the increase in costs is unsustainable.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that up to 577,000 policy holders, which equates to just under 53% of all policies, may be affected by this measure.  However, I should point out that many will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase.  In addition, individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely.  The new ceilings will ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.<\/p><p>  The Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited.  The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.  The Government fully supports the elderly in retaining access to medical insurance via community rating of insurance premiums.  Community rating, in principle, provides that everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.  Community rating therefore means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require.  Older people who have been paying health insurance premiums for many years will have contributed to intergenerational solidarity when they were younger and could reasonably expect to benefit from it now.  The support system that enables community rating, which involves the charging of a levy on the policies of younger individuals, is referred to as risk equalisation.  In view of these existing supports for the elderly in obtaining medical insurance, I am not in favour of the introduction of additional tax relief for those aged over 70.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500058#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Resources","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500058#WRJ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[1498\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500058#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to provide funding for the purchase of an additional mobile X-ray scanner to the Revenue Commissioners.

The Commissioners have also confirmed that by the end of December 2013 the amount of LPT collected for 2013 was &euro;242m and &euro;76m was collected in respect of 2014.  In the region of 78% of liable persons have already confirmed their payment method for their 2014 LPT liability and a constant number of property owners continues to submit their 2014 payment instructions to Revenue each day.  Since the start of the New Year, LPT payments in the order of &euro;1m are being received every working day.<\/p><p>  The Commissioners are also currently working through over 60,000 items of correspondence relating to property owners 2014 LPT obligations.  They advise that any person who has submitted a genuine query (by email\/letter\/voicemail to the LPT helpline) regarding their 2014 liability in advance of the filing date will be treated as having complied with their requirements on time, once they file their payment instruction for 2014 promptly when the query is resolved.  Processing returns which continue to be filed and dealing with this correspondence is Revenue's current priority.  The Commissioners strongly advise anyone who has not yet confirmed their payment method to go on-line immediately to file their 2014 Payment Instruction in order to avoid interest charges.  Where a person requires assistance with filing on-line or does not have their Property ID or PIN, they should call the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.<\/p><p>  On the Household Charge, as I informed the House in my reply to Questions 147 (54014\/13) and 148 (54015\/13) on 17 December 2013, section 156 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that where the &euro;100 Household Charge for 2012 had not been paid by 1 July 2013 the arrears amount is increased to &euro;200 and is regarded as Local Property Tax (LPT).  The &euro;200 arrears can be paid by property owners using any of the payment methods that are currently available for paying LPT.  I understand that to date some &euro;2.7m has been paid directly to Revenue in respect of about 13,500 properties and payments continue to be received on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  An extensive data matching exercise has been undertaken by Revenue since it received the Household Charge database from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA).  The Commissioners have confirmed that about 1.3m records from the LGMA's Household Charge Register have been matched with the LPT Register but it will not be possible to fully match all Household Charge payments to the LPT Register.  The main difficulty is where different people paid the Household Charge and the LPT for the same property; for example, where someone other than the owner paid the Household Charge, the owner's details will not be on the Household Charge Register.  Mismatches arise particularly in the case of properties with non-unique addresses.  The Commissioners estimate that approximately 45,000 properties fall into this unmatched category.<\/p><p> I strongly recommend that property owners check their LPT record online at  using their Property ID and PIN. If Revenue's LPT record shows that there is &euro;200 LPT\/ Household Charge arrears but they have paid their Household Charge, they should send Revenue a copy of the receipt for the Household Charge and Revenue will remove the charge from the LPT record.<\/p><p>  I previously informed the House that Revenue will begin a compliance campaign on LPT\/Household Charge arrears in the first quarter of 2014.  Two elements of this campaign have already been implemented persons who have outstanding LPT liabilities, including Household charge, will not receive a tax clearance certificate, and those whose 2013 LPT was deducted at source on a mandatory basis have been advised that this is continuing.  Further elements of the campaign will be rolled out over the coming months supported by a public awareness campaign.  These taxes cannot be avoided because the relevant properties cannot be transferred without payment of outstanding LPT liabilities.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have a duty, in the interests of fairness and equity to those who are compliant, to take effective follow-up action to recover the tax from the non-compliant.  I support Revenue's approach, which is to seek to maximise the level of voluntary compliance from property owners in the first instance, but to apply the range of enforcement options and other sanctions available thereafter if non-compliance persists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500059#WRK00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Application","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500059#WRK00350"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[1580\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500059#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to reduce the universal social charge or to reform it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>The position is that the Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced from 1 January 2011 to replace the Income Levy and the Health Levy.

This scheme, which is provided for in Articles 306 to 310 of the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010.  Detailed discussions with the travel industry were carried out prior to the introduction of the scheme.  The scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers.<\/p><p>  Travel agents covered by the scheme are liable to VAT on their supply of certain services, not in respect of the consideration they receive for such services but in respect of the travel agents margin on those services.  The nature of the scheme means that the travel agent only has an obligation to account for VAT on the margin in the country where he is established.  VAT rates are not harmonised across EU Member States so the rate at which the margin is chargeable to VAT may vary from country to country.  In Ireland, the margin apportioned to travel activities located in the EU is liable at the standard rate, currently 23%.  Where the travel activities are located in non-EU destinations, such supplies are subject to the zero rate of VAT.<\/p><p>  The EU VAT Directive provides that Member States that had been applying a zero rate or a reduced rate to certain goods or services on 1 January 1991 may continue to apply those rates after that date but not to extend their scope.  In general, each Member State defined in its national legislation the goods and services to which rates lower than the standard rate applied.  There is no legislative basis for Ireland to apply a reduced rate to travel activities located in the EU.

The learning outcomes of these revised programmes require the graduate teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs, to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching, to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils, to evaluate learner progress, to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes.  Student teachers may also have access to additional elective courses with content focussing on special education.<\/p><p>  All primary teachers are qualified to teach in any primary or special school classroom.

The HEA has consulted with institutions and the following data has been gathered.<\/p><p>  I set out below details of PLOS papers per Irish higher education institution published in 2011 and 2012. Please note that the number of citations for recent years (i.e. 2012) is usually lower than that for earlier years as it takes time for citations to accrue. This is reflected in the tables below. <\/p><p>  Information on the PLOS pricing model is also set out below. The PLOS publication pricing has many variables and may be discounted or waived in certain cases. For example, published authors are entitled to institutional membership discounts. In addition papers published by Irish higher education institutions would have multiple authors, including international collaborators, with publishing costs being shared. This, along with the multiplicity of associated research funders, some of whom pay publication costs, makes it impossible to determine the cost to individual Irish institutions with any degree of accuracy. <\/p><p>  Unfortunately, the information in relation to Beall's list is not readily available and would involve a substantial amount of staff resources within each higher education institution to ascertain whether any articles appeared on such a list. <\/p><p><b>  PLOS Pricing criteria<\/b> (source:  ). To provide open access, PLOS journals use a business model in which expenses &mdash; including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving &mdash; are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. Prices are as follows:<\/p><p><i>- PLOS Biology<\/i>  US$2900<\/p><p><i>- PLOS Medicine<\/i> US$2900<\/p><p><i>- PLOS Computational Biology<\/i> US$2250<\/p><p><i>- PLOS Genetics<\/i> US$2250<\/p><p><i>- PLOS Pathogens<\/i> US$2250<\/p><p><i>- PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases<\/i> US$2250<\/p><p><i>- PLOS ONE<\/i>  US$1350<\/p><p>  PLOS is committed to the widest possible global participation in open access publishing. To determine the appropriate fee, we use a country-based pricing model, which is based on the country that provides 50% or more of the primary funding for the research that is being submitted. Research articles funded by Upper Middle and High Income Countries incur our standard publication fees. Corresponding authors who are affiliated with one of our  are eligible for a discount on this fee. Such authors will be informed of the discount applicable after submission of their manuscript.<\/p><p>  Fees for Low and Lower Middle Income Countries are calculated according to the  for manuscripts submitted after 9am Pacific Time on September 4, 2012 (this program is not retroactive).<\/p><p>  - Group One: Countries from this  will not be charged for publishing<\/p><p>  - Group Two: Countries from this  will be charged a flat $500<\/p><p>  Our fee waiver policy, whereby PLOS offers to waive or further reduce the payment required of authors who cannot pay the full amount charged for publication, remains in effect. Editors and reviewers have no access to whether authors are able to pay; decisions to publish are only based on editorial criteria.<\/p><p><b>Number of PLOS papers per Irish HEI published in 2011 <\/b><table><tr><th><b>Institution<\/b><\/th><th><b>No. of PLOS papers<\/b><\/th><th><b>No. of Times Cited<\/b><\/th><th><b>Impact (Average Cites per Document)<\/b><\/th><th><b>h-index<\/b><\/th><th><b>Journal Actual\/Expected Citations<\/b><\/th><th><b>Category Actual\/Expected Citations (1 = expected citations)<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN<\/b><\/td><td>36<\/td><td>341<\/td><td>9.47<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>2.50<\/td><td>3.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN SCHOOL OF DENTAL SCIENCES<\/b><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>23.00<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2.81<\/td><td>5.54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN<\/b><\/td><td>37<\/td><td>204<\/td><td>5.51<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>1.88<\/td><td>2.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK<\/b><\/td><td>12<\/td><td>118<\/td><td>9.83<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>2.56<\/td><td>3.69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>NUI GALWAY<\/b><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>5.50<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1.11<\/td><td>1.80<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS IRELAND<\/b><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>5.38<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1.85<\/td><td>2.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>WATERFORD INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY<\/b><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>13.00<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>7.08<\/td><td>8.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>NUI GALWAY<\/b><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>26.00<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3.18<\/td><td>6.27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>DUBLIN CITY UNIVERSITY<\/b><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>7.33<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2.03<\/td><td>3.42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>NUI MAYNOOTH<\/b><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>4.67<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2.02<\/td><td>2.28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>UNIVERSITY OF LIMERICK<\/b><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2.00<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0.61<\/td><td>0.84<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>DUBLIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY<\/b><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><br \/><b>Number of PLOS papers per Irish HEI published in 2012 <\/b><table><tr><th><b>Institution<\/b><\/th><th><b>No. of PLOS papers<\/b><\/th><th><b>No. of Times Cited<\/b><\/th><th><b>Impact (Average Cites per Document)<\/b><\/th><th><b>h-index<\/b><\/th><th><b>Journal Actual\/<\/b><b>Expected Citations<\/b><\/th><th><b>Category Actual\/Expected Citations (1 = expected citations)<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN<\/b><\/td><td>53<\/td><td>109<\/td><td>2.06<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5.41<\/td><td>4.67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN<\/b><\/td><td>48<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>1.75<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4.67<\/td><td>4.39<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>UCD CONWAY INSTITUTE OF BIOMOLECULAR &amp;amp;

Accordingly, it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.

In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.  The NCSE will also shortly be inviting schools to make applications for SNA support for the coming 2014\/15 school year and will consider applications for support for new pupils enrolling to schools.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500064#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff Remuneration","counter":620,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500064#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[1323\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500064#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will arrange for requested information to be supplied to a person (details supplied) in County Wexford as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":622,"content":"<p>A UA\/UB 32 Details of Earnings (DSP Form) was completed by my Department in respect of the individual referred to, and sent directly to the Department of Social Protection offices in Enniscorthy on 30\/08\/2013.

The works carried out, which vary from location to location within the overall site, include strengthening \/ remedial works to existing structures, strengthening and stabilisation of riverbanks, removal of noxious weeds, excavation, demolition and other works associated with regrading the river bed and widening the channel, construction of flood defence structures and debris traps, demolition and rebuilding of existing walls, cladding \/ finishing to flood defence structures, diversion of existing services, construction of a 7.4m x 4m culvert at Bray bridge, structural stability works at Bray bridge, blocking of an arch at Ravenswell road and construction of an embankment behind the flood defence structure in the golf club lands.  <\/p><p>  Works of a similar nature to those listed above remain to be carried out at other locations along the river, along with the demolition of the existing riverwall and excavation of a section of the People's Park, removal of the weir downstream of Bray bridge, construction of an emergency flood relief channel in the golf club lands, works at the railway bridge and general landscaping.  Based on the original contract amount, the total estimated cost of the project, comprising costs of construction, fees, site supervision, compulsory acquisition and maintenance, is approximately &euro;28m.  Bray Town Council and the OPW remain fully committed to completing the Bray flood relief scheme to provide the standard 1-in-100 year level of protection and every effort is being made to achieve this objective as soon as possible.  The cost of completing the project is provided for in the OPW's projections of capital expenditure to 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500065#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":688,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500065#WRQ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":689,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[1518\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500065#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Civil Service Commission will consider applicants residing in the\u00a0proximity of\u00a0vacancies\u00a0when recruiting for positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":690,"content":"<p>Since 2004, recruitment to the civil service has taken place under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.

With regard to the five older university schemes, the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 provided for the transfer of their pension funds to the National Pension Reserve Fund. In accordance with Section 11 of the Act, discretions regarding added years, etc. transferred from the Governing Bodies to the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform acting jointly. I understand my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has separately provided the Deputy with details of any such awards made since the implementation of this Act.<\/p><p>  - Ill-Health\/Death in Service: Added years may be granted in the Civil and Public Service in cases of retirement on the grounds of ill-health or where a Survivor's pension is being awarded in circumstances where the civil or public servant dies while still in service.<\/p><p>  - Section 6 of the Superannuation Act 1909 and Sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 set out rules governing the early retirement of Civil Servants as a result of abolition of office or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in order to effect greater efficiency and economy in the organisation of a Department. Section 6 of the 1963 Act provides for the granting of added years.  (These provisions may apply to Secretaries General at the end of their contracts; similar provisions apply to City &amp;amp; County Managers under the Local Government Superannuation Scheme). In the wider Public Service these provisions serve as guidelines in dealing with similar cases.<\/p><p>  - Chief Executive Officers of Non-Commercial State Sponsored Bodies may, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, be granted added years at the end of their contract.<\/p><p>  It is not the case that the granting of added years is subject in all cases to direct Ministerial approval.  Added years are generally granted on an administrative basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant pension scheme or statutes.  Only in an exceptional case would formal Ministerial approval be required.<\/p><p>  As regards the detailed information sought, it should be noted that, once a pension is calculated and comes into payment, a breakdown of the various service components upon which that pension is based is not retained centrally nor readily available.  It would take an inordinate amount of official time and effort to obtain the information as it would necessitate examination of the files of all retirees since 2007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500066#WRR02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500066#WRR02425"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[1381\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500066#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of commercial and non-commercial State agency board positions under the aegis of his Department filled between March 2011 and December 2013; the number of these positions that were publically advertised; and the number of female appointments.

The application of international accounting standards is provided for in the circumstances set out in Regulation (EC) No 1606\/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 (the &ldquo;IAS Regulation&rdquo;). The IAS Regulation which sets out the adoption procedure for these international accounting standards does not provide for any adoption procedure as regards the Conceptual Framework, and, accordingly, this does not form part of EU law. The issue, therefore, of the omission of prudence from the IASB Conceptual Framework being contrary to EU company law does not appear to arise.  However, ultimately it is for the courts to determine if a matter is contrary to the law.<\/p><p>  International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39) &ldquo;Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement&rdquo;, as adopted by the EU requires an &ldquo;incurred loss&rdquo; approach to what it terms the &ldquo;impairment and uncollectability of financial assets measured at amortised cost&rdquo;.

However, even during the so-called &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; years, Irish people chose to emigrate for career or personal reasons.  It is also a factor that, where a person employed in a multinational company in Ireland undergoes an intra-company transfer to a different country, this is also classified as emigration in the CSO statistics.<\/p><p>  The number of Irish emigrants who have returned to Ireland in the past two years is estimated at 36,000.  Many of them are coming home having gained skills and expertise abroad that we can now capture to strengthen the operation and management of companies based here.<\/p><p>  At a macro level the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to re-build the economy and accelerate the transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, innovation and exports. This Department&rsquo;s focus is primarily on employment creation in the Enterprise Sector. We are doing this through the Action Plan for Jobs and have already seen the positive results of the action being taken across the whole of Government to support the enterprise sector to sustain existing jobs and create new ones. <\/p><p>  Recent figures published by the CSO indicate that the number of people employed in Ireland increased by 58,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2013, which is a reversal of the situation which faced the Government coming into office.  That increase in employment is made up of a mix of people; some leaving the Live Register, some entering the Labour Market for the first time and some returning emigrants.<\/p><p>  There are many initiatives from other Departments that seek to provide alternative routes for those who might be considering emigration &ndash; JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum and JobPlus are all new initiatives supplementing existing programmes in F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the UCC report from last September and its findings, which showed that 47% of Irish emigrants had full time jobs when they emigrated, while just under 40% wanted to travel and experience other cultures.  Others will have moved within their company to postings in other countries as part of a career development or global mobility plan.  Many of these emigrants will gain important skills and insights from working overseas, but may well return to Ireland in the future.<\/p><p>  I am clearly concerned that emigration is impacting on so many households, especially in rural areas, but I have noted the finding that a sizeable proportion of emigrants are leaving for reasons other than being unemployed.<\/p><p>  While the private sector has been adding on average 1,200 jobs per week for the past year is a very encouraging sign for the economy, we must continue to build on this progress and support further job creation.  I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan on behalf of the Government and we will continue, through that process, to build on the success of the actions we have taken over the last two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500067#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":774,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500067#WRS01150"},{"type":"question","counter":775,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[55213\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500067#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the engagements he or his Department has had with Irish emigrants or their representatives since he took office.","asker":"1066","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":776,"content":"<p>As far as possible when leading trade missions to support Irish exports, I try to connect with as many members of the Irish business diaspora as possible.

Key to this process is engagement with key stakeholders who are being consulted in order to better inform the policy choices to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the patent court.

In addition Enterprise Ireland arranges international buyer visits to Ireland.  These visits are focussed on sectors rather than specific geographic locations.  In 2013, Enterprise Ireland attracted over 900 international buyers to Ireland.

The soft supports include the provision of business advice, training and mentoring to all clients. The aim is to develop indigenous enterprise potential, stimulate economic activity at local level and promote the establishment of micro-enterprises within their administrative area. These supports are available to everyone, regardless of age.<\/p><p>  The CEBs have long been active in working with schools to promote entrepreneurship within the education system, primarily through close engagement with second level schools throughout Ireland but are also active with primary schools and third level colleges.

Part of that response included a Pilot Competitive Feasibility Fund for the South East Region which was established by Enterprise Ireland in 2012 with the aim of stimulating start-ups and creating jobs in the South East. The fund was designed to assist a new start-up company or individual entrepreneur to investigate the viability of a new growth orientated business or proposition.

Five of these have fully completed the study while a further 5 are in the process of completion and the remaining 4 companies have yet to engage fully in the process.

The review identified two companies which had received approval for grant aid without meeting fully the employment and sales growth conditions laid out in the scope of the scheme. <\/p><p>  The two companies concerned were awarded approximately &euro;10,000 each in support of their feasibility projects subject to expenditure of &euro;20,000 of the companies&rsquo; own funds in advance of application to Enterprise Ireland for payment. In both cases the evaluation team deemed the applications to be of sufficiently high quality to be awarded the funding particularly as regards their development and employment potential.

However, I understand that one complaint in respect of the company mentioned, that has yet to be heard, has been submitted to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) under Unfair Dismissals legislation.<\/p><p>  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms, the Labour Relations Commission, including the Rights Commissioner Service, and the Labour Court, to assist parties in their efforts to resolve disputes, if requested.  It is expected that the parties availing of these services do so in good faith and with a view to accepting the outcome of the process.<\/p><p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) carries out inspections of employers records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation.  These inspections arise: <\/p><p>- In response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation;<\/p><p>- As part of NERA inspections focusing on compliance in sectors where there is an identifiable risk of non-compliance and,<\/p><p>- As routine inspections, which act as a control measure.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all persons legally employed in Ireland on an employer-employee basis.  These protections relate to the statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions.  A person who is working under a contract of employment on a full-time or part-time basis has the same protection under law as all other workers.<\/p><p>  NERA aims to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.  While every effort is made to secure compliance, some employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and\/or pay money due to their employees.  These employers are referred for prosecution.<\/p><p>  Where people have concerns that workers may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.

Shortly after entering office, I committed to a fundamental reform of the State&rsquo;s existing Workplace Relations Services.  The overall objectives are to promote harmonious and productive employment relationships and to encourage early resolution of disputes, the vindication of employees&rsquo; rights and minimisation of the costs involved for all parties - employers, employees and Government - in terms of money, time and workplace productivity.  To this end, I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure which will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.<\/p><p>  I am certain that we can deliver a workplace relations system that will be supported by proportionate, effective and efficient compliance and enforcement measures.  For this reason, I am proposing to make provision in the Workplace Relations Bill for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of Compliance Notices, Fixed Charge Notices and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC Adjudicators and Labour Court Determinations.  I am confident that the introduction of these measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500070#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Protection","counter":889,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500070#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":890,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[1728\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500070#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the way the European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations 1988 are employed here; the number of times the National Consumer Agency have referred anyone to the courts under these regulations; if he and the National Consumer Agency will agree to meet with the Clinical Dental Technician Association to discuss the illegal practice of dentistry here with regards to the European communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations, 1988 and the Consumer Protection Act 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":891,"content":"<p>The European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations 1988 (S.I. 134 of 1988) were revoked in 2007.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.  There is evidence that this is already occurring &ndash; Eurostat estimates that the seasonally-adjusted rate of youth unemployment has fallen from almost 31% in late 2011 to just under 25% at the end of 2013<\/p><p>  In addition to promoting medium-term economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.  To this end, youth unemployment is being specifically targeted through our Youth Guarantee initiative. . I will be publishing details of this initiative shortly.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, work experience opportunities being provided to the under 25s, in the following table, outlines the expected provision and indicative costs associated with the provision of training and work experience opportunities for under 25s in 2014.<\/p><p>  These costs will be funded, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer.  However, it is expected that a number of these programmes will meet ESF eligibility criteria and will be included in the Youth Employment Initiative application for Ireland.

Time spent on certain activation measures may count towards eligibility to participate on JobBridge, however an individual must have a live qualifying claim before commencing an internship placement.  Further information on eligibility criteria is available on the JobBridge website at<i><\/i>.<\/p><p>  The eligibility to access JobBridge is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register.  JobBridge has been launched in this targeted way to allocate scarce exchequer resources fairly while ensuring that it does not replace or displace the normal operation of the labour market, which is an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The Department is determined to ensure that jobseekers are not disincentivised from seeking employment rather than internships.  Internships, while an outstandingly positive addition to the Department&rsquo;s labour market interventions, are not the only route into employment.  Approximately 40% of people signing on the Live Register exit the Live Register within 3 months of signing-on, that is, before they are eligible for JobBridge.  These criteria underpin the ethos of JobBridge and, for that reason, the Department does not allow for any exceptions in relation to these eligibility criteria.<\/p><p>  The independent evaluation of JobBridge (conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants) found that 61.4% of former interns had progressed into paid employment within 5 months of completion of a JobBridge internship.  These exceptionally high rates of progression into employment compare very favourably with similar schemes across Europe.  <\/p><p>  The Indecon evaluation clearly demonstrates that JobBridge is delivering for thousands of jobseekers by providing them with valuable opportunities to gain relevant work experience, knowledge and skills in a workplace environment<\/p><p>  11,316 individuals started JobBridge internships in 2013.

Prior to the 2009 Act, only the benefits of active scheme members could be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits.  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act further extends the options available to trustees of a scheme to include a portion of benefits payable to pensioners.  It essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.  However, the legislation restricts the extent to which pensioner benefits can be restructured as it is considered that this group of beneficiaries, being already retired, has least potential to make up losses due to a restructure of scheme benefits.<\/p><p>  The changes in respect of deferred members are not an unintended consequence.  This group is treated the same as active scheme members for the purposes of section 50 of the Pensions Act.  A deferred scheme member is a scheme member who has left employment to which the scheme relates and who is entitled to a pension payment at a future date.  A deferred member may be close to retirement or may be many years from retirement age and may have the opportunity to accumulate pension entitlements in a number of pension schemes before reaching retirement age.<\/p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries. <\/p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty. To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra customers became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.<\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was abolished from 1 January 2014. I am not in a position to make exemptions to this decision. I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone. However, in ending the telephone allowance my Department has been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity\/gas allowance and the free television licence. We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase. <\/p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full. The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm. <\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer. The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines. <\/p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.

I believe that, in aggregate, a significant public funding investment of up to &euro;500, 000 is being made to mark this millennium. <\/p><p>  Of course, in addition to the Millennial anniversary of Clontarf, I will also be making arrangements for commemorations in 2014 relating to the centenary of the founding of Cumann na mBan, the Curragh Mutiny, the import of arms by the Volunteer movements and, of course, the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. <\/p><p>  With regard to Limerick City of Culture 2014, the Deputy will be aware that the Government agreed with my proposal that Limerick City should be designated, given that it is undergoing a process of profound change at present and 2014 is an important year for the city, as it will be the year in which a new single local authority will be established.  The Limerick Reorganisation Implementation Group (LRIG) is preparing for this change and I believe that the designation of Limerick as a City of Culture for 2014 will help to shape, brand and promote a new Limerick city.<\/p><p>  I believe that Limerick&rsquo;s designation as City of Culture for 2014 will deliver a programme of cultural events and engagement in arts and culture by the citizens of Limerick and beyond. In bringing artists, arts organisations, local authorities and civic groups in the city and county together in a calendar of events which will showcase all that the city has to offer, I am confident that the initiative will generate a legacy, both locally and nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500076#WRBB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1162,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 427 and 428 answered with Question No. 425.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Issues","counter":1163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500076#WRBB01325"},{"type":"question","counter":1164,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[1354\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500076#WRBB01400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will provide in tabular form year on year the occasions on which he has signed off on the awarding of added years to public sector workers between March 2011 and December 2013; the grade of the persons awarded the added years; and the number of added years awarded in each instance.","asker":"1008","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1165,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware my Department was established on 2<sup><\/sup>June 2011.

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries. This is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 142 salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river. <\/p><p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive and Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies with the requirements of this legislation. The conservation imperative means that exploitation of salmon from each river is only permitted where the independent Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon (SSCS) determines that the stock in that river is above its conservation limit. The advice of the SCC is available on the website of IFI &ndash; <\/p><p>  During migration from rivers to marine feeding grounds, salmon from both rivers in Ireland and rivers in other countries travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters. These &quot;mixed stocks&quot;, either in coastal waters or distant waters, pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity. The difficulty is that it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals or stock groups at sea.<\/p><p>  Research in coastal areas and in the marine environment concentrates on increasing knowledge of migratory patterns, marine based mortality and return rates to home rivers as stock assessments can only be carried out on the individual stock in each river. <\/p><p>  The conservation\/exploitation balance is best achieved where fisheries target individual river-based stocks that have been shown to be at full reproductive capacity and capable of sustaining the genetically unique population of that individual river.<\/p><p>  In order to align fully with the EU Habitats Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) advice, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon. Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over the conservation limit. Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits.<\/p><p>  Any deviation from this policy would be contrary to the international independent scientific advice as the &quot;home river&quot;

This Scheme is currently funded by way of a set proportion of net television licence fee; I expect that a similar funding structure will apply following the introduction of the Public Service Broadcasting Charge. <\/p><p>  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is assigned responsibility under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 for the administration of the Scheme. <\/p><p>  Section 158 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that the BAI shall every three years review the operation, effectiveness and impact of the Broadcasting Funding Scheme, and make a written report to my Department. In April 2012, following a tender process the BAI engaged Crowe Horwath as independent Consultants to carry out the required review. The resultant Report addresses the impact, effectiveness and operation of the Scheme as well as including key findings from a stakeholder consultation and rightly recognised the important contribution of community broadcasting to Irish society. This Report was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 November 2013. <\/p><p>EU State Aid approval of the existing Scheme terminates at the end of this year and, in anticipation of this, in November 2013, the BAI issued a consultation paper on a proposed replacement Scheme.

The draft Scheme will be examined by my Department to ensure that it adequately fulfills the relevant policy objectives as enunciated in the legislation, including those relating to the development of community media. EU State Aid approval will also be required prior to the new Scheme becoming operational on 1 January 2015.<\/p><p>  Finally, I should mention that the BAI also operates the Community Broadcasting Support Scheme, which is a separate development fund specifically established to enable community radio stations to evaluate their activities. The scheme provides funding for stations to carry out key review work to assist with their overall performance to build capacity. The BAI works closely with the community sector in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500077#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Postcode System Establishment","counter":1221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500077#WRCC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1222,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[1091\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500077#WRCC02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the latest developments with regard to the new postcode system; the amount expended on this project to date; and the stage the tender process is at.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the National Broadband Scheme means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.<\/p><p>  In the normal course of events, my Department does not maintain information on the exact coverage offered by the many operators who offer broadband services and, given the different technologies and different types of service offered by these operators, it would not be practical to attempt to say whether one county had more or less broadband than another. Accordingly it is not possible to provide the detailed information sought in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  However, information relating to broadband services which are available in the Irish market can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the roll-out of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise currently underway will identify and map current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). The mapping data which has been submitted to my Department by operators is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to EU State Aid Guidelines, and engagement with participating operators is ongoing. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.<\/p><p>  It is my intention to publish the map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage later this year, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country. <\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500078#WRDD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries Regulation","counter":1237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500078#WRDD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1238,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[1198\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500078#WRDD00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns that the existing legislation regarding inland fisheries does not take into account the needs of modern fisheries management, including the control and management of invasive species, the implementation of necessary conservation measures such as bag limits, size limits, catch and release regulations and the ongoing requirement to control water pollution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It represents the most important investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations and will position our energy system for decades to come.<\/p><p>  The Government's July 2012 <i>Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure <\/i>underlined the urgent need for new energy infrastructure and its importance to individual consumers, but acknowledged that it will be necessary to have public confidence that relevant projects and programmes adhere to the highest international standards of safety, particularly with regard to health, environmental and visual impacts, and avail of optimal technologies. <\/p><p>  Neither the Government nor I seek to direct the energy infrastructure developers to particular technologies, sites or routes as was made clear in the Government Policy Statement. That statement emphasises that these are matters for the developers and for the forward planning process through regional and local development plans and at project level through the development management process. Ultimately, it will fall to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to determine whether the views expressed have been adequately taken into account in the final project design. <\/p><p>  The Grid25 consultation process is a key opportunity for public input as no decisions have been made regarding the final routes of these electricity lines. Following conclusion of the consultations on the &euro;500m Grid Link project, I have had a productive meeting with the Board and senior management of EirGrid. Some 35,000 submissions from the public are now being sifted through in detail by EirGrid and I have asked the company to prepare an initial list of the main issues raised. I am satisfied that the value of the public consultation will be determined by the character of the response to the issues raised. I am committed to making a response to the public consultation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as soon as an initial report is available. I expect to be able to respond before the end of this month.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that Grid25 is completely separate from the work underway on a possible Inter-Governmental Agreement with the UK on wind export. Grid25 was underway long before any proposals in this regard. Grid development is required to serve our own domestic energy needs, and it will be still required regardless of whether any agreement with the UK emerges. <\/p><p>  EU policy is to encourage greater integration and interconnectivity between member states. EirGrid has the statutory responsibility in this regard. Enhanced security of supply, increased competitiveness, and the ability to integrate greater quantities of renewable generation resources are some of the potential benefits of further interconnection between the transmission grids of Ireland, Great Britain and mainland Europe. I understand from EirGrid that a number of studies are exploring different aspects of the feasibility of additional interconnection and these will feed into the decision of future interconnection investment.<\/p><p>  I have had no discussion with Coillte regarding the use of their lands for any part of the Grid25 project.<\/p><p>  I look forward to reporting back to the House on these matters before the end of this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500078#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1257,"content":"<p>Question No. 463 answered with Question No. 449.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1258,"content":"<p>Question No. 464 answered with Question No. 448.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation Targets","counter":1259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500078#WRDD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1260,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[1337\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500078#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the current storage capacity within the electricity grid; and the targets that have been set to increase same in order to take full advantage of electricity generated from renewable sources.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1261,"content":"<p>There is no storage capacity within the electricity grid.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including Counties Galway and Limerick, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in Counties Galway and Limerick. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, Eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4 million premises with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in Ballinasloe in County Galway and in Abbeyfeale in County Limerick before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputies.<\/p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the roll-out of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500079#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services Provision","counter":1278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500079#WREE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1279,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[1562\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500079#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding premium telephone numbers (details supplied) ","asker":"1182","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1280,"content":"<p>The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) manages and administers the National Numbering Scheme which lists all numbers and codes that are available on public telecommunications networks. <\/p><p>  There is no obligation on companies providing services to the public to provide or display any particular type of telephone<b><\/b>number.

The change from manager to chief executive, which reflects modern terminology, is an important aspect of clarifying the appropriate roles of the executive in implementing policy of the council as, in effect, the board of directors of the authority.

For example, there are increased obligations on the chief executive to provide additional advice and assistance to elected members in the discharge of their roles at council and municipal district levels and in various committees.  Chief executives will be obliged to have regard to the views of elected members while policy options are still in formation and will have to assist elected members in the development of new policies at an early stage of the policy development process.

This Bill is currently before the Oireachtas.   <\/p><p>  Spending limits were first introduced for the 2009 local elections and were based on a sliding scale.

I should advise the Deputy that the Property Services Regulatory Authority was established in April 2012 under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and is responsible for controlling and regulating Property Service Providers (i.e. Auctioneers\/Estate Agents, Letting Agents and Management Agents).<\/p><p>  To enable the Authority to exercise its regulatory role, Section 65 of the 2011 Act provides that the Authority \"shall, following the receipt of a complaint, or may of its own volition, cause such investigation as it thinks fit to be carried out...\" to identify any \"improper conduct\" which has or is being committed by a Property Services Provider.  I am advised by the Authority that it does not collect or collate information in relation to cash buyers.  The Authority is aware that in recent years there has been an increase in the number of properties bought for cash. This could, however, be attributed to a decrease in mortgage lending and the Authority is not currently aware of any more sinister explanation for this trend.<\/p><p>  However I can assure the Deputy that measures are in place to ensure that any suspicious transactions can be examined by the law enforcement authorities. A Property Services Provider is a \"designated person\" for the purposes of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  To comply with that Act, designated persons are required to have a range of measures in place to ensure that customers are not laundering money or financing terrorism.  This includes identifying and verifying the identity of customers and beneficial owners, training their staff, keeping records etc. and making Suspicious Transaction Reports as necessary to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  Under Section 42 of the 2010 Act, where a Property Service Provider knows, suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect, on the basis of information obtained in the course of business that another person has been or is engaged in money laundering or terrorism financing they are required to make a Suspicious Transaction Report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners. All Suspicious Transaction Reports are subsequently investigated as appropriate by the law enforcement authorities to examine any links such transactions may have to any form of criminal activity.<\/p><p>  I can further inform the Deputy that it is my intention to confer the relevant powers under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 on the Property Services Regulatory Authority, by way of an order under Section 60 of that Act, to enable that Authority to monitor property service providers for the purpose of securing compliance by such providers under the requirements of the Act. I understand that it is the intention of the Property Services Regulatory Authority, once such powers are delegated, to include as part of its normal regulatory investigations, an examination of how property service providers are complying with their obligations under the 2010 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500083#WRJJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coroners Service","counter":1469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500083#WRJJ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1470,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[1237\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500083#WRJJ01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the operations of county morgues and county coroners expenses still have to go through the local authority and be accounted by the local authorities; and his plans to make changes in the future to the present set up.","asker":"1049","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1471,"content":"<p>I understand that with the exception of Dublin, where specific arrangements apply, local authorities are not involved in the provision of funding for morgue facilities.

The Bill, which I propose to introduce this year, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.<\/p><p>  The new legislation is being prepared in compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in the field of international protection which principally includes the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and the applicable instruments of the Common European Asylum System.  In this regard, the EU Asylum Qualification Directive 2004\/83\/EC provides that Member States shall ensure that family members of the beneficiary of refugee or subsidiary protection status, who do not individually qualify for such status, are entitled to claim certain benefits which are included in the content of international protection set out in Chapter VII of the Directive.  These benefits include a residence permit, a travel document and access to employment, education, social welfare, health care and accommodation.  The Directive defines family members as including the spouse of the beneficiary of refugee or subsidiary protection status and the minor children of such a couple or of such a beneficiary of refugee or subsidiary protection status.  In accordance with the requirements of the Directive these provisions are currently reflected in relevant Irish laws, regulations and administrative provisions.  This will continue to be the case under the new legislation.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that I made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State.  The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case.  Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively.  As I have said previously, by its very nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes.  However, now that processing has recommenced and once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for subsidiary protection applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.  In those circumstances I would anticipate very significant inroads to be made on the caseload by the end of 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500084#WRKK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":1517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500084#WRKK01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1518,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[55425\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500084#WRKK01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details of all migrant-led organisations which applied for moneys from the European Refugee Fund and European Integration Fund; the number of organisations that were successful; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The competition itself will involve a number of stages of assessment and evaluation including online questionnaires and assessments, on-site assessments, interviews, and physical and medical examinations.

Phase II is for 65 weeks, when they will be based in Garda stations with the full policing powers.  Phase III then consists of 7 weeks of exam preparation, exams and assessments.

It will also contain details of the procedures to be applied to the processing of applications for licences.  I hope to publish the Bill in the autumn but meanwhile, details on the procedures and processes involved are already available in the general scheme of the Bill (which is available on my Department's website).<\/p><p>  I will begin by setting out some general principles.  Only those forms of gambling permitted by the new Act may be carried on. In addition, where the gambling is of a type that is permitted, it may be carried on only if conducted under and in conformity with a licence. Each licence will be accompanied by terms and conditions designed to protect consumers and to prevent criminal activity.  The onus is on the applicants to fulfil the requirements of the legislation but the regulator will also be required to carry out extensive and detailed consideration of applications.  Heads 29 to 39 contain all the major requirements to be met by applicants for licences.  It is essential that the public has confidence in the licensing system and that it is satisfied about the integrity and bona fides of licence holders.<\/p><p>  Head 4 reflects this requirement, it sets out the primary purposes to be served by the new Bill. Among them is the need to ensure gambling is not used by or for criminal purposes.  Head 32 reflects the issues I have just mentioned. Each applicant for a licence must declare any convictions either in the State or elsewhere.  Failure to disclose a conviction may lead to an application being refused.  It may also result in the withdrawal of a licence issued to an applicant whose failure to disclose is established only after the licence has been granted.  There will be provision for the Minister to specify certain offences that, due to their relevance and nature, must be declared in all cases where applications are being submitted.<\/p><p>  All applicants must, of course, be treated fairly.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would be unreasonable to provide that the mere fact of a conviction would debar anyone from ever holding a licence.  Heads 32(4) and 34(3) therefore set criteria for the evaluation of convictions.  The offence involved will be evaluated by its gravity and relevance to the preservation of the integrity of the licensing system.<\/p><p>  Finally, I must draw attention to Head 12. It is of critical importance as it provides for enhanced cooperation arrangements at international level between regulators.  These arrangements will facilitate contacts and exchanges of information (including records of convictions) between our authorities and their counterparts abroad.  They will allow for independent verification of the applicant's status and of the information he \/ she has supplied or has failed to supply.

In most cases the cost of such operations is partially or fully funded through the FRONTEX budget which more than compensates for the annual contribution.

When I came into office there was a backlog of approximately 22,000 applications for naturalisation with cases taking 2 years and sometimes significantly more to process.  Rightly so, there were major criticisms of these delays and I set about addressing this matter with the result that today most standard cases are being processed in less than six months.  This essentially means that applicants are required to attend citizenship ceremonies at reasonably short notice.  I must say that, having attended and officiated at almost all ceremonies, my experience is that the candidates are universally appreciative of the reduced timescales for processing their applications as well as being immensely proud of becoming Irish citizens.  As outlined in the following paragraphs, information is provided at the various stages to applicants and arrangements can be made to reschedule candidates scheduled for a particular ceremony if they cannot attend.<\/p><p>  The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation include an initial examination upon receipt of each application to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for further attention while valid applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act such as good character and lawful residence and enquiries are made, as appropriate, with relevant Departments and agencies to establish if the applicant meets the requirements for the granting of naturalisation.  It should be noted that my Department keeps applicants informed of the status of their application at each stage of processing.  Once these processes are completed, the application is submitted to me for a decision which is made in my absolute discretion under the Act by assessing the entirety of the information available to me.  All applicants are then informed of my decision in writing.<\/p><p>  Successful applicants are then advised by letter of my intention to grant citizenship and they are requested to submit the prescribed fee and other documents, including their up-to-date GNIB card.  On receipt of the fee and documentation, the case is finalised and in due course the person is invited to attend a citizenship ceremony at which they required to make a declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation. <\/p><p>  Candidates are informed that if the ceremony date does not suit them they are not obliged to attend.  However, due to the volume of applications, it may take some months before an alternative invitation can issue.  Invitations are generally issued between two and a half and four weeks prior to a ceremony.<\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Citizenship Unit makes every effort to ensure that as much notice as possible is afforded to candidates and to take account of individual circumstances.  However, in this context, it should be noted that candidates are required to submit the required fee and documentation within approximately six months of notification of my intention to grant the application and failure to do so or repeated failure to attend a citizenship ceremony may result in a requirement for a new application as fresh verification and checks will be necessary. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">   <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500086#WRMM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade in Tobacco","counter":1636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500086#WRMM02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1637,"qnumday":595,"qnumall":"[1687\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500086#WRMM02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of all of the resources, salaries, vehicles, fuel, ancillary costs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na used specifically and exclusively in the effort to prevent, counter and fight the importation and sale of illegal cigarettes for the year 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1638,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 169 (ref: 54483\/13) of Wednesday, 18th December, 2013 which was practically identical to the current Question.<\/p><p>  In that reply I advised the Deputy that law enforcement in relation to the smuggling of tobacco products and the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products and the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products within the State is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

The latest report for 2012 is available on the website of the Irish Youth justice Service ( www.iyjs.ie ).<\/p><p>  In relation to the GSAS, the Committee recommended that it continue to work with the Garda Youth Diversion Office to profile high crime areas in order to target more effective  and efficient responses and interventions for young people and that the Garda Youth Diversion Office utilise the expertise of GSAS to enable tracking of children through the system in support of the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children's lives 2011-2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500087#WRNN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":1663,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500087#WRNN01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":1662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500087#WRNN01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1663,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[55293\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500087#WRNN01300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if and when further recruitment to the Defence Forces, including the Permanent Defence Force and Reserve Defence Force might be contemplated with a view to ensuring optimum strength; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1664,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 30 November 2013, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,286, comprising, 7,478 Army, 775 Air Corps and, 1,033 Naval Service personnel.

I believe that this can be achieved in the context of the reformed EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which places long term sustainability at its core.  The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was secured after many months of extremely complex negotiations with the European Parliament and is a significant achievement  of the Irish EU Presidency.   This radical reform will support the rebuilding of fish stocks in our waters as Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas are set to deliver maximum sustainable yield by 2015, where possible and by 2020 for all stocks and the wasteful practice of discarding fish is phased out.  In order to support the introduction of the obligation to land all catches,  the reform provides that where the discards ban is introduced, TACs and quotas will be fixed taking into account the change from setting TACs that reflect landings to setting them to reflect catches on the basis that for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed.  <\/p><p>  The whitefish quotas agreed at the December Fisheries Council involves a reduction from 36,674 tonnes to 33,266 tonnes for 2014.  While some of the quotas for whitefish stocks were reduced in the Celtic Sea, this reflected the scientific advice of poor recruitment into the stocks of cod, haddock and whiting, the cuts were required to take account of the scientific advice. I opposed a proposal from the EU Commission for a 24% reduction in the economically important prawn (nephrops) quota<i><\/i>in the Irish Sea and off the south and west coast.  I sought a roll over of the nephrops TAC and in the final outcome negotiated the Commission proposed 24% cut down to a  9% reduction  which while not welcome reflected a more balanced recognition of the scientific concerns about the state of stock in certain areas.<i><\/i>  For other whitefish stocks such as the economically important hake and monkfish, significantly increased quotas were secured reflecting the positive scientific advice for these stocks.   In addition, part of the whitefish fleet operating in the Celtic Sea will benefit from the increase of 30%  in the Celtic Sea herring quota, the 14% increase in the albacore tuna quota and the expected increase in the mackerel quota.  <\/p><p>  While I am conscious that the available whitefish quotas for our fishing fleet were reduced for 2014, the level of the cuts agreed at the EU Fisheries Council were significantly below those proposed by the EU Commission.   While the reduction in available whitefish quotas will impact on some vessels dependant on whitefish catches,  I have over the past two years been pursuing a strategy to increase value added in the seafood sector and this strategy,  implemented through BIM,  is intended to support Irish fishermen to maximise the value of their catch and present top quality fish to prime markets. Significant opportunity exists for improvement in this area and BIM is assisting the industry to be more innovative; to improve product quality and other standards; to develop environmental management systems (EMS); and to engage in accreditation programmes that lead towards recognised and accepted eco labels and responsible fishing brands.  BIM will continue to support, in 2014,  the industry to achieve these objectives.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500090#WRQQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Funding","counter":1806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500090#WRQQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1807,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[55555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500090#WRQQ01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding 50:50 co-funding for rural development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The funding schemes support the work of some 32 national and regional youth organisations and some 480 local youth work projects and involve services to some 400,000 young people throughout the country. The youth organisations and services are voluntary, not for profit organisations or limited companies. It is estimated that some 40,000 volunteers are involved in the sector. <\/p><p>  The recruitment, employment and deployment of staff including youth workers are matters for the youth organisations and services themselves. An Assessment of the Economic Value of Youth Work (Indecon, 2012) carried out on behalf of the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI), estimated that there were the equivalent of 1,397 individuals employed on a full-time, paid basis in the sector. These employees include those in management roles as well as service delivery and include youth workers.  Youth workers are employed directly by the youth organisations, services and projects to deliver programmes and services including recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal and social development opportunities for young people throughout the country. Information about the number of youth workers employed by youth organisations and services by county is not readily available to my Department. <\/p><p>  With regard to the Deputy's enquiries about the possibility of securing support for a youth worker position for a local service, if the Deputy provides details of the situation in question, my Department will make arrangements to clarify the matter with the relevant youth organisation or Education and Training Board in the locality.<\/p><p>  The Community Employment Scheme (CE) is an important feature of the voluntary youth work sector. Under the CE scheme, youth organisations and services sponsor placements offering work experience and skills acquisition opportunities to unemployed people to improve their chances of integration into employment elsewhere in the economy.  It is a requirement of the scheme that the placements offered do not displace or replace existing jobs. Youth work organisations and youth projects benefit through the contribution of CE workers in areas such as maintenance, security, caretaking, the administration of youth facilities, youth centres and youth activity centres and work which is essential to the effective organisation of youth groups, particularly in youth projects for disadvantaged young people. The NYCI report indicated that in 2010, there were some 256 CE workers employed in the youth sector<\/p><p>  My objective is to ensure the ongoing development and provision of, and access to, quality youth work services to young people. Well qualified and trained youth workers have a key contribution to make to the attainment of this objective along with skilled volunteers who have a significant role the provision of local services.  The National Youth Work Advisory Committee which comprises representatives of the voluntary youth services, Government Departments and other youth work interests, has an important advisory role to me in this context. <\/p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and will continue to meet, with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to achieve these shared objectives for the provision of quality services to meet the needs of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":2000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU01550"},{"type":"question","counter":2001,"qnumday":716,"qnumall":"[55340\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children currently on the waiting list for a special care placement; the average waiting time for such a placement; her views on recent reports that up to 40 children are waiting for a special care placement.","asker":"1020","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2002,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is currently being finalised and I will forward the information directly to the Deputy this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":2003,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2004,"qnumday":717,"qnumall":"[55429\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which agency staff have been used in her Department in each of the past five years to date for the purpose of answering and transferring calls on their switchdesk; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2005,"content":"<p>Reception duties, including switchdesk operations, are performed by employees of my Department.

The development of the youth strategy will take account of the information needs of young people and the role of modern technology in meeting those needs and it will be informed by the views of youth service providers and young people in this regard.<table><tr><th>Youth organisation <\/th><th>ORGANISATION WEB ADDRESSES<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>An Oige<\/td><td>www.anoige.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Belong To Youth Service<\/td><td>www.belongto.org<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Catholic Guides of Ireland<\/td><td>www.girlguidesireland.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Crosscare (formerly Catholic Youth Care)<\/td><td>www.cyc.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Church of Ireland Youth Department<\/td><td>www.ciyd.org<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Confederation of Peace Corps<\/td><td>www.localise.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ECO - UNESCO Clubs<\/td><td>www.ecounesco.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Experiment In International Living<\/td><td>www.eilireland.org<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Feachtas<\/td><td>www.gaelteic.com\/feachtas<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>For&oacute;ige<\/td><td>www.foroige.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Girls Brigade<\/td><td>www.girlsbrigadeirl.com<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Involve<\/td><td>www.involve.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Girl Guides<\/td><td>www.irishgirlguides.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Junior Chamber Ireland<\/td><td>www.jci-ireland.org<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Macra na Feirme<\/td><td>www.macra.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama<\/td><td>www.youthdrama.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Federation of Arch Clubs<\/td><td>www.archclubs.com<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Youth Council of Ireland<\/td><td>www.youth.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>No Name Club Ltd<\/td><td>www.nonameclub.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ogra Chorcai<\/td><td>www.ograchorcai.org<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ogras<\/td><td>www.ogras.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Order of Malta Cadets<\/td><td>www.orderofmalta.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scouting Ireland Ltd<\/td><td>www.scouts.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Boys Brigade<\/td><td>www.boysbrigade.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Voluntary Services International<\/td><td>www.vsi.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Young Christian Workers<\/td><td>www.ycw.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Young Irish Film Makers<\/td><td>www.yifm.com\/index.php<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Young Mens Christian Association<\/td><td>www.ymca-ireland.org<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Youth Work Ireland<\/td><td>www.youthworkireland.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Girls Friendly Society<\/td><td>www.girlsfriendlysociety.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DYCW Methodist Church in Ireland<\/td><td>www.irishmethodist.org\/dycw<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Presbyterian Youth<\/td><td>www.pciyac.org<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>L&eacute;aras &ndash; the Exchange Bureau<\/td><td>www.leargas.ie<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award <\/td><td>www.gaisce.org<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":2020,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2021,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[1056\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500094#WRUU02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will roll out the crisis intervention service emergency out of hours social work service for children and young people under the age of 18 nationwide; if her Department has costed the national roll out of this service; if she will provide details of the current CIS and how many referrals were made to the service in 2012 and 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2022,"content":"<p>The Child and Family Agency (CFA) provides a range of services aimed at addressing emergency situations in the area of child welfare and protection.

The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of voluntary youth work organisations, is also considering issues to do with progressing this important agenda for our young people.<\/p><p>I  , and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet with many youth organisations and groups to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs, including the area of employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500095#WRVV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework","counter":2042,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500095#WRVV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2043,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[1791\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500095#WRVV01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when she plans to publish the children and youth policy framework; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2044,"content":"<p>Work on the completion of the new Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework is now at a very advanced stage and I expect to be a position to submit the Policy Framework for Government approval in the very near future.

A further reduction of 30% was applied to these scales for those interviewed for posts on or after 1st October 2012.  Serving consultants interviewed for academic posts on or after 1st October 2012 are allowed retain their existing salaries.  In addition, on 1st July of 2013 consultants' pay was reduced in line with the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  As set out in the Haddington Road Agreement, these reductions were not applied to the 1 October 2012 pay scales, having regard to the level of reduction already applied.  Consultants have also been subject to changes in work practices under the PSA.  These include the range of flexibilities agreed at the LRC in September 2012 to enhance productivity and efficiency.  Arising from the LRC engagement, two items were referred to the Labour Court for a binding ruling &ndash; current rest day entitlements and the fee payable for second opinions under the Mental Health Acts.  A third issue, historic rest days, was referred under the normal IR processes.  <\/p><p>  The Court recommended a 25% reduction in each consultant's entitlement to historic rest leave and that this must be used by 2020.  Management are giving effect to this recommendation.  In relation to rest day entitlements the Labour Court recommended that compensatory rest be given in respect of actual call-out time only rather than leave (in the form of rest days) whether there is a call-out or not.  Implementation of this recommendation is under discussion in order to ensure workable arrangements that will not adversely affect care.  The Court recommended that the fee payable to Consultant Psychiatrists for the provision of a Second Opinion under the Mental Health Act, 2001 be addressed as part of the review of allowances in the public service.

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.<\/p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.<\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified by a GP or Consultant, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. For the purpose of the decision making process for an emergency medical card, in these circumstances, a &quot;terminal illness&quot;, or a person who is &quot;terminally  ill, is a person who is certified by a Doctor or a Consultant as &quot;terminally ill&quot;.<\/p><p>  Terminally Ill means that the person is suffering from an illness that will end in death, where there is no possibility of recovery and the person is more likely to die of their illness in the next six months than not.<\/p><p>  I note from the details provided by the Deputy that the constituent in question was issued with a medical card for a period of one year (May 2013 to May 2014).

I have been assured that patients with CF will have priority access to these ten beds at all times.  The ring fencing of beds for CF patients has been an issue in other hospitals around the country but has been resolved through written agreements and good operational procedures.  I am confident that a similar agreement can be reached in this instance.<\/p><p>  The key issue is that patients with CF are assured that sufficient beds will be available when they are needed, but at the same time, when beds are not needed for CF patients, they can be freed up for other very ill patients with respiratory and other conditions.

Implementation has been delayed by a number of factors including the changed economic context, constraints in public spending and the moratorium on recruitment.  It is disappointing that the pace of change towards a modern, patient-centred, recovery orientated mental health service has been somewhat slower than expected but it is the Government's intention that over time access to modern mental health services in the community will be significantly improved.  Since 2012, this Government  has prioritised the reform of our mental health services with the provision of an additional &euro;90 million and some 1,100 posts primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness and forensic mental health services in line with <i>A Vision for Change.<\/i><\/p><p>  A detailed progress report on implementation on each of the recommendations is not available.  However, a great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes the development of child and adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care,  the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.<\/p><p>  The establishment last year of the HSE Mental Health Services Division and the appointment of the National Director for Mental Health, delivers on a key recommendation of <i>A Vision for Change.  <\/i>This new Division carries operational and financial authority and accountability for all mental services.  I expect that this new structure within the HSE will accelerate the pace of change in the development of our mental health services.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive's National Service Plan for 2014, setting out the type and volume of health and social services the HSE will provide during the course of this year, commits to a number of key deliverables in 2014 continuing to progress the key multi-annual priorities<b><\/b>from previous years including implementing the Access Protocol for 16 and 17 year olds to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and reconfiguring General Adult Community Mental Health Teams (CMHT) to serve populations of 50,000 as recommended in <i>A Vision for Change.<\/i><\/p><p>  During 2014, the HSE will develop an implementation plan for the last 3 years of <i>A Vision for Change <\/i>and develop a Standard Model of Care.  It will focus on developing a major work stream within the mental health clinical programme which will seek to address a variety of issues that have existed for some time and have been raised during the initial engagement process with internal and external stakeholders.<\/p><p>  These include:<\/p><p>  -  Reduce variation and over time provide a relatively standard level of basic service regardless of location.<\/p><p>  -  Access to, from and flow through the services, general care pathways and out of hours access.<\/p><p>  -  How mental health can best support and integrate with primary care, acute hospitals and other services.  <\/p><p>  -  A Change Management plan to get to the desired level of acute and non-acute beds, day hospitals versus day centre, etc.<\/p><p>  -  Involving service users, carers and family members &ndash; moving from consultation to co-production, and greater recovery focus.<\/p><p>  In addition, the HSE will begin to address foundational issues within mental health services including <\/p><p>  -  Develop an initial workforce plan for 2014 to bring greater certainty around essential replacements<\/p><p>  -  Streamline recruitment to allow for more local control and specialisation where appropriate<\/p><p>  -  Develop an initial training and development strategy for Mental Health<\/p><p>  -  Build national capacity to respond in a standardised way to serious adverse incidents<\/p><p>  -  Commence key projects to address ICT gaps.<\/p><p>  The National Mental Health Division is currently preparing a National Mental Health Divisional Plan which will detail further its objectives in 2014 and will include prioritised actions for each Mental Health Catchment Area.  It is expected that the Divisional Plans will be considered by the HSE Directorate next week with a planned publication shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500099#WRZZ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":2266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500100#WRAAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2267,"qnumday":807,"qnumall":"[1019\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500100#WRAAA00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of child and adolescent inpatient beds available in psychiatric hospitals for young persons experiencing mental health difficulties; the location of these inpatient beds; the number of inpatient beds at each location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2268,"content":"<p><i>A Vision for Change<\/i> recommends the provision of 80 child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient beds nationally.

As e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco they are currently not regulated under our tobacco legislation. <\/p><p>  In order to harmonise the way EU Member States regulate e-cigarettes, the new Tobacco Products Directive being developed by the European Commission will, inter alia, provide for the regulation of e-cigarettes.  It is anticipated that the Directive will be adopted formally by Council later this year following a vote in the European Parliament.  Member States will have two years to transpose the Directive.<\/p><p>  The Tobacco Directive will set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc. for e-cigarettes that do not fall under the definition of medicinal products of Directive 2001\/83\/EC.    The new Directive will make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory, introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes, impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  The Directive will also enable Member States and the European Commission to react in the case of any identified  health concerns related to these products.<\/p><p>  In light of the above and in view of the emerging evidence base around E-Cigarettes, I have asked my Department to review the issue in order to inform  policy and regulation in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500102#WRCCC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":2387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500102#WRCCC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2388,"qnumday":850,"qnumall":"[1257\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500102#WRCCC03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to the Topical Issue debate of 18 December 2013, if he has received a response from the Health Service Executive; if he will now hold an independent investigation into all of the circumstances surrounding this case and its handling by HSE management; the steps taken to trace patients of both the public and private dental clinics involved; if he can reassure patients that there is no infection risk as a result of this practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2389,"content":"<p>An Expert Group established by the HSE investigated public health aspects of this case and determined that the risk of infection is miniscule.

The objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services for children with a disability including those with autism so that there is a clear pathway to the services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that currently persist around the country.  <\/p><p>  The issue of service levels and funding to be provided for the disability sector is a matter for the HSE in the first instance and needs to be considered in 2014 in light of the resources available and the relevant service priorities.  In general terms, HSE disability services are embarking on a large scale reform programme which will transform the model of service to a community-based model of person centred care.  In 2014, the HSE are taking a number of key steps in implementing the change programme, including rolling out a new model of assessment and intervention, in line with the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People.  An additional &euro;4 million has been allocated, which equates to 80 additional therapy staff, for these purposes.  <\/p><p>  Specifically in relation to Beechpark Services in North Dublin, in 2013, the HSE allocated funding to HSE Dublin North East for Beechpark Services, in order to address the waiting list for services in Dublin North East.  This provided, in the first instance, for the recruitment of five therapy staff.   This process is under way.  The HSE also assigned a Disability Manager in Dublin North East to oversee the re-configuration of early intervention services for children and young people with disabilities in the region, in line with the national Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People.  The Independent Expert Review Group, which was established to look at the Beechpark model of services, is also nearing completion.  The Group has also been asked to consider and make recommendations on a resource allocation model for children&rsquo;s disability services including autism across the HSE.  The Group is currently consulting with the HSE on recent developments in respect of the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500104#WREEE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Services","counter":2459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500104#WREEE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2460,"qnumday":876,"qnumall":"[1429\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500104#WREEE01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure the recent incident (details supplied) is not repeated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2461,"content":"<p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Pharmacy Regulator is conducting an investigation into the case referred to by the Deputy.

It is acknowledged that response time indicators should not be used in isolation to evaluate pre-hospital emergency service delivery.  Following a review of the validity of time-based KPIs for clinical status data, and in line with international views, it is considered that clinical outcome indicators should also be used.

There are in the region of 300 such agencies at present across the country that provide a significant and broad range of services for children and adults with disabilities in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.  It is important to note that many children and adults with a disability can be very effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  <\/p><p>  Dyspraxia is a developmental co-ordination disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.  For some children, dyspraxia can affect their learning capacity.  For this reason they may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.  A comprehensive range of supports is in place in our school system to supports these children.  <\/p><p>  From a health perspective, there are a number of therapies that can make it easier for people with dyspraxia to cope.

It is the responsibility of the regulator,\u00a0the National Transport Authority (NTA),\u00a0to\u00a0adjudicate on applications from the\u00a0CIE companies and\u00a0the Railway Procurement Agency for fare increases or changes to fares. I think it is important to point that heavy rail is very expensive to run and journeys by Irish Rail remain heavily subsidised while journeys by car, Luas or\u00a0bike are not.<\/p><p>  In\u00a0our dealings with all companies,\u00a0we have consistently emphasised that they must reduce costs ahead of future fare increases or service cuts.\u00a0 However, in the current environment, it is the case that fare increases will be inevitable if costs cannot be reduced sufficiently in order to maintain a reasonable level of service provision and protect our network.\u00a0It is, however, important to point out that significant savings can be made by passengers who choose to avail of the integrated ticket, the Leap card.\u00a0In many cases, passengers will be paying fares that are below 2011\u00a0cash fares when using the Leap card.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the NTA's statutory responsibilities,\u00a0the Government recognises\u00a0the need for the CI&Eacute; companies to respond to the challenge of reduced PSO subvention funding, reduced fares income arising from reductions in passenger numbers and increased costs, such as fuel costs, which are outside their control.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to remember that public transport remains heavily subsidised\u00a0by the State and fares would be much higher if people had to bear the full cost of providing PSO services.<\/p><p>  Over the past 18 months I have monitored the financial situation in CI&Eacute; and the subsidiary companies, including Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, to ensure a return to financial stability in order that they can continue to provide an essential service to the public. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has incurred accumulated losses of &euro;130m in the past five years, a position which is unsustainable.<\/p><p>  My Department and the NTA are working with\u00a0Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to increase the efficiency and attractiveness of existing rail\u00a0services. The Government continues to provide substantial Exchequer investment in the rail network.\u00a0Despite the reduced level of funding available, my Department has allocated over &euro;150m towards the rail network this year.\u00a0Investment in roads has been severely curtailed since 2009 and at current levels is less than what is required to maintain and protect our investment in the longer term.<\/p><p>  In addition to safety related works, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is undertaking infrastructural works to improve journey times such as removing or upgrading level-crossings, providing automated ticketing machines, improving station facilities - all of which contribute to making the railway more competitive and attractive to passengers. As well as capital investment, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will also receive a total allocation of &euro;117m in 2014 for Public Service Obligation (PSO) services.\u00a0There have been reductions in subvention in recent years\u00a0due to pressure on the public finances but I will be\u00a0proposing that there be\u00a0no further cuts to the PSO subvention from 2015.<\/p><p>  Through the NTA, my Department is also funding the use of smart technology to make public transport easier to access and more reliable for the user.\u00a0 Significant progress has been made with the Leap card, Real Time Passenger Information, and the National Journey Planner which maps all public transport services across the country. The use of Wifi on trains and buses has also improved the transport experience. The NTA will continue to progress these consumer friendly initiatives which make using public transport more attractive. The public transport experience has improved significantly and that is where we must target our efforts in future. I hope that no further reductions in subvention,\u00a0a stabilisation of\u00a0passenger numbers as the economy improves and cost saving measures in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will mean that future fare increases can be minimised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500107#WRHHH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Safety","counter":2624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500108#WRJJJ00075"},{"type":"question","counter":2625,"qnumday":934,"qnumall":"[1076\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014011500108#WRJJJ00100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a fuel emergency mayday on 14 December 2013 out of Dublin on a Ryanair aeroplane which diverted to Liverpool and landed with less than final reserve fuel on board; and the steps he will take in this matter in view of the previous call by the Irish Aviation Authority on Ryanair to review its fuel policy and the very serious potential consequences for passenger safety.

In drawing up the Action Plan, one of the options considered by my Department was reducing the service available at Malin MRSC to that of daytime only.
