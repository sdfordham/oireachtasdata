The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>There are circa 88,000 premises in County Kildare, approximately 20,000 (23%) of which are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining c.68,000 (77%) premises are located in the commercial blue area and will be served by commercial operators. <\/p><p>My Department is actively monitoring commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all households and businesses can get access to the services.\u00a0 My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.\u00a0 This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. <\/p><p>I should add, however, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).\u00a0 I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.<\/p><p>The map indicates that the townlands of Legan and Ardagh Demesne County Longford are\u00a0within the AMBER area and will, therefore, be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP. <\/p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand and\u00a0a prioritisation programme will be put in place in consultation with\u00a0the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. <\/p><p>Two Regional Action Groups have been established to\u00a0work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate\u00a0broadband\u00a0rollout in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce has moved to the Implementation\u00a0phase.\u00a0\u00a0The Implementation Programme on Mobile Phone and Broadband Access\u00a0identifies 19 of the 40 Taskforce actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Government Departments and State Agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  Each of the actions and Implementation Programme has its own timeframe for delivery, see\u00a0Report: \u00a0. <\/p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the combination of initiatives, and the procurement process to deliver a new high speed broadband network under the NBP, will put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity, and ensure that high speed broadband services are universally available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[13925\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which his plans have progressed to develop the alternative energy sector in view of international trends and the extent to which dependency on imported fuels is likely to increase in the absence of a robust non fossil fuel sector; the degree to which reliance on foreign imports and costs associated therewith can be reduced significantly in the next ten years by way of the development of all viable alternatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced electricity to all consumers.  The Energy White Paper, published in December 2015, sets out a high-level framework for Ireland's energy transition to a low carbon economy and society and identifies a range of measures and actions to support this aim.<\/p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter\u00a0target also being legally binding.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.  Overall,\u00a0SEAI analysis\u00a0shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s\u00a0energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and that this avoided &euro;286 million of fossil fuel imports.  Provisional data for 2016 from\u00a0SEAI shows\u00a0that 27.3% of electricity demand was\u00a0met\u00a0from renewable sources. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)\u00a0Scheme, designed to assist in\u00a0meeting our RES-E and RES-H targets.  The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission. <\/p>  <p>  In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.\u00a0 Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme\u00a0took effect from 1 January 2017 when the rate\u00a0increased to 8% by volume.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, which is underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, provides the high-level policy direction for the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  The development of sectoral mitigation measures for the electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture sectors to be set out in a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) is well advanced.  The primary objective of the first NMP will be to monitor measures already underway and identify potential additional measures that, in the medium to longer term, will reduce GHG emissions.  This will assist Ireland to achieve our national transition objective to become a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the end of 2050.\u00a0 Following a public consultation launched last week, the NMP will be submitted to Government for approval in June.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Recreational Angling Sector","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[13689\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans for further funding in 2017 to develop and enhance infrastructure associated with angling (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>My Department provided &euro;500,000 in funding support for the National Strategy for Angling Development (NSAD) in 2016 and Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) reviewed applications in respect of a first call for projects based on this funding.\u00a0 I announced approval for\u00a0the first &euro;500,000 of investment for 50 community-based projects nationwide in\u00a0December last.<\/p>  <p>  I have also secured an additional &euro;1.5 million for NSAD investment for this year and further tranches of project funding will be announced in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, IFI secured funding of &euro;536,000 from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the Action Plan for Rural Development, with which the NSAD is aligned.<\/p>  <p>  The NSAD is the first comprehensive national framework for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s angling resource.

Rigorous implementation of environmental policy and legislation, underpinned by the principle of proportionality, is the appropriate approach to adopt in protecting our environment.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the independent statutory body responsible for protecting the environment in Ireland.  The EPA performs a wide range of statutory functions in fulfilment of its mandate.<\/p>  <p>  For example, the EPA has a key role in licensing facilities with the potential for significant environmental pollution, to ensure that their emissions do not endanger human health or harm the environment.  The EPA is responsible for issuing Industrial Emission Directive Licenses; Integrated Pollution and Control (IPC) Licenses; Waste Licences; Waste Water Discharge Authorisations; Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Authorisations; and Radiological Protection Licences.<\/p>  <p>  The EPA also encourages participation in its regulatory activities, through providing input to its decision making processes and reporting any negative environmental impacts from facilities that it licences such as odours, noise or water pollution. <\/p>  <p>  While overall compliance with EPA Licences is good, the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement introduced a new methodology in 2015 for risk-ranking National Priority Sites which takes account of enforcement performance, giving a timely, dynamic and accurate picture of where regulatory responses should be directed.<\/p>  <p>  Targeting actions in the right places is also of critical importance to the EPA in addressing the problems in both an effective and efficient manner, and they are placing a particular focus on any licensed industrial, waste and waste water facilities creating nuisance for adjacent communities.<\/p>  <p>  EPA prosecutions are particularly focussed on priority sites and issues. In 2016, the EPA conducted over 1,500 site visits at licensed facilities and\u00a017 prosecutions were pursued. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EPA operates in a transparent and open manner, publishing comprehensive details about its activities.\u00a0 Further information is available to the public on www.epa.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Although the EPA, like many other State Bodies, has immunity from liability for civil damages, it is important to clarify that it is not immune from prosecution, as it is answerable and accountable before the Irish Courts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bioenergy Strategy Implementation","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[13894\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the status of the draft bio-energy plan; when he anticipates publishing this plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>The Draft Bioenergy Plan sets out the policy areas that must be coordinated to support the development of biomass sector in Ireland. \u00a0It also identifies 19 measures to support the sustainable development of the sector. \u00a0There are a wide range of Government departments, agencies and state bodies that are critical enablers for bioenergy development by virtue of their responsibility for areas such as forestry, agriculture, waste, research funding and business development.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is\u00a0still in the process of\u00a0finalising the draft Environmental report and associated Natura Impact Statement in respect of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment for the Bioenergy Plan.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that these documents and a revised draft bioenergy plan to go for public consultation in quarter two this year.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP, including over the last 12 months\u00a0has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises\u00a0in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband of\u00a0a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging\u00a0investment by the telecoms sector, which is\u00a0continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The latest ComReg quarterly report highlights that over 65% of all broadband customers now\u00a0avail of high speed broadband services\u00a0( &amp;gt; 30 Megabits per second).  It also indicates that\u00a0uptake over the past quarter includes an increase in customers availing of Fibre to the Premises\u00a0(FTTP) of\u00a0\u00a0over 20.2%.\u00a0 While this represents only 7,623 premises,\u00a0this is a large increase over a short period and is a very encouraging indicator of the popularity of\u00a0FTTP products.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map is available at :\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all\u00a0households and businesses can get access to the services.\u00a0 My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.\u00a0 This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.\u00a0 My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map\u00a0to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.\u00a0<\/p><p>In the short-term I am\u00a0working to ensure\u00a0measures are put in place to assist in the rollout of the NBP State Intervention network once a contract is awarded and to\u00a0improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.<\/p><p>In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.\u00a0 The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken\u00a0to remove barriers\u00a0and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link:. <\/p><p>Minister Humphreys has established\u00a0two Regional Action Groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock\u00a0barriers\u00a0to investment in mobile and broadband services.\u00a0 Since July, there has been significant\u00a0progress made in discussions with\u00a0the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.<\/p><p>I\u00a0signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band in\u00a02017.

My long-standing position on the gas network is that\u00a0it should be developed generally in rural Ireland to provide natural gas to as many areas as possible.  Accordingly, and against the backdrop of the energy policy White Paper, my Department is preparing to commission research and to have a report by year-end\u00a0into the potential role that natural gas could play in\u00a0supporting rural centres.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, I am interested in whether ways can be identified\u00a0to facilitate additional connections to the network contributing to rural development, without additional costs for all gas consumers. <\/p>  <p>  I have, over recent months, had discussions with GNI, including a meeting in December 2016, on its economic and financial analysis relating to proposals to establish a gas pipeline in County Longford. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB05400"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[13693\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100063#WRB05500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress he is making with the waste industry to ensure when proposed pay-by-weight charges for refuse collection are introduced later in 2017 they will not result in price rises for households, which occurred in July 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>The charges applied by waste management companies are matters for those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008 -2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.\u00a0 The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published\u00a0projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels, depending on whether additional policies or measures beyond those already in place by the end of 2014 are implemented.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to\u00a0have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2eq).  According to the latest\u00a0inventory published by the EPA in November 2016, GHG emissions for 2015 are estimated to be 59.84 MtCO2eq. This is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, the\u00a0shortfall to 2020 projected by the EPA reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis (including the impact of the troika programme and the EU fiscal governance requirements), and the fact our 2020 target was very significantly above what would have been cost-effective for Ireland to contribute to the overall EU effort.  It now represents a significant challenge to be addressed, including as we look out to 2030.\u00a0 In order to maximise Ireland's emissions reductions under the 2009 ESD and address the gap to the 2020 target, it will also\u00a0be necessary to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned through the National Mitigation Plan. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I published a draft of the National Mitigation Plan for public consultation on 15 March 2017.\u00a0 This public consultation will help inform further work in my own Department and across Government to finalise the Plan later this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100064#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":101,"content":"<p>Question No. 72 answered with Question No. 43.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies Code of Conduct","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100064#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[13881\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100064#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he is satisfied that the oversight role of his Department with regard to adherence to the revised codes of practice for State bodies 2016 is fit for purpose with particular regard to oversight of the national broadcaster RT&Eacute;.","asker":"1259","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>The revised\u00a0Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies was published in August 2016 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and\u00a0all State bodies, including RT&Eacute;, are required\u00a0to be fully compliant in respect of\u00a0the first full financial\u00a0year following publication.

Relevant legislation in this area includes section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, section 8 of the Family Law Act 1995, section 13 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 and section 45 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.

The requirement of Article 34 of the Constitution that justice be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution is a matter that would have to be carefully considered.  <\/p>  <p>  The full year cost of establishing a child maintenance agency would depend on a number of factors, including the specific functions that such an agency would perform and the expected level of demand for the services of such an agency.

The Valuation Office has recently revalued all commercial properties in a number of rating authority areas as part of a revaluation programme that will see the valuation of all commercial properties in the State brought up to date by reference to modern property values.  I have been informed by the Commissioner that a number of wind farms in the relevant counties have been revalued as part of this programme.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of a revaluation in a Local Authority area is to redistribute the rates burden with each ratepayer's liability reflecting up-to-date property rental values.  The Valuation Acts 2001-2015 provide for an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, (an independent statutory body established for that purpose), and a subsequent appeal to the High Court on a point of law, for all valuations carried out under the Valuation Acts.  The basis of rateable valuation for all property is \"net annual value\", as defined in Part 11 of the Valuation Act 2001.  Section 48 of the Act, as amended, provides that net annual value is the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that stage, and all rates and other taxes in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that in accordance with well established international valuation principles and best professional practice, and in keeping with the case law of the independent Valuation Tribunal and the jurisprudence of the Higher Courts, various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value of a property or class of properties for the purposes of section 48.  One commonly used method is known as the \"receipts and expenditure\" method of valuation where trading accounts relating to the use of a particular property are analysed to estimate its net annual value.  Another method of valuation used from time to time, depending on the particular circumstances and type of property involved is known as the \"contractor's method\" where the annual equivalent of the cost of construction, allowing for depreciation as appropriate and the value of the site, is used to arrive at the net annual value.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that, as regards the valuation of wind farms, the Valuation Office sought information on construction and development costs as well as detailed trading information for such facilities and that the information provided was used to draw up a valuation scheme, based on a combination of the \"receipts and expenditure\" and the \"contractor's\" methodologies, for the wind farms which have to date been valued under the revaluation programme.  I am also advised that the valuations of a number of wind farms have been appealed to the independent Valuation Tribunal, which will issue its determination in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100064#WRC06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100064#WRC06600"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[14080\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100064#WRC06700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her position in relation to\u00a0the challenge by a person (details supplied) to the stand contractual clauses for the transfer of data from the EU to non-EU locations such as the US; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[14081\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100064#WRC06800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Data Protection Commissioner will be more vigilant than in the past regarding\u00a0companies that use personal data for commercial purposes without consent,\u00a0specifically taking into account the new regulatory context opened by the General Data Protection Regulation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, the Data Protection Commissioner acts independently in the performance of her tasks and exercise of her powers.

I, as Minister for Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in either of the decision-making processes.<\/p>  <p>  The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as road or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system - distributing the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  Following revaluation, there is generally a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.<\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts provide several avenues of redress for the occupiers of property and for a number of other categories of persons listed in the legislation who are dissatisfied with a determination of value under the provisions of the legislation.  Firstly, there is a statutory right for the occupier of a property to make representations within 40 days to the Valuation Office in relation to the proposed valuation to be placed on their property.  Since the statutory mandate of the Valuation Office is to ensure that valuations of all rateable property are correct, equitable and uniform, relative to each other, consideration of representations made to the Office in respect of an individual property may result in a decrease, increase or no change in the valuation of that subject property.  The outcome is based on the evidence provided to and available to the Valuation Office.  In any event, this outcome may be the subject of an appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question in relation to the appeal process to the Valuation Tribunal, the legislation specifies the categories of persons who have a right to appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.  These include (a) an occupier of the subject property under appeal; (b) an occupier of other rateable property situated in the same local authority area as the property under appeal; (c) a rating authority; and (d) a person, in respect of any property in relation to which he or she is an interest holder.  While in most cases, the appellant is usually the occupier of the premises subject to revaluation or their professional representative, it is possible for a person listed in categories (b) to (d) to lodge an appeal.  In determining an appeal the Valuation Tribunal may, under Section 37 of the Valuation Act 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, decrease or increase a valuation or determine that no change is warranted.<\/p>  <p>  In reaching its decisions, the statutory duty of the members of the Valuation Tribunal is to ensure that valuations are (insofar as is reasonably practical) correct, equitable and uniform, relative to each other.  The professional expertise in both law and valuation practice of the Tribunal members is brought to bear in arriving at such decisions.  Therefore I have no reason to consider that the decisions of the Valuation Tribunal are unfair in circumstances where the valuation of a property is reduced, remains the same or is increased.  Appeals to the Tribunal are dealt with in a comprehensive manner involving the consideration on a quasi-judicial basis of detailed, formal written documentation submitted to it.  The Tribunal can hold hearings as provided for in the legislation which allows for the taking of oral evidence and the receipt and consideration of written submissions made to it by and on behalf of all parties to the appeal concerned, including any person appearing to the Tribunal to have an interest in or be likely to be affected by the determination of the appeal.  When issuing its decisions, the Valuation Tribunal issues formal, written judgments which provide clear and cogent reasons for its decisions and these judgments are available to the public on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website, www.valuationtribunal.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Time Zones","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[12940\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if further consideration has been given to bring forward the start of summer time to the last weekend in February; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Winter time begins at 1:00 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday in October every year when clocks are put back by one hour.

The simple fact that someone may wish to settle here as a retired person does not, of itself, create an entitlement for that person to do so.  Over a number of years retired persons seeking to come to Ireland to live has become a prominent new channel for migration into the State.  In the interests of clarity and greater transparency the immigration service published guidelines for such persons in March 2015.  The overriding requirement is that such persons must be able to show that they have sufficient resources.  In particular, they must satisfy the immigration service that they:<\/p>  <p>  - Have an annual income equivalent to &euro;50,000<\/p>  <p>  - Have savings equivalent to the cost of buying a new home in Ireland<\/p>  <p>  - Have comprehensive private Irish-based medical insurance<\/p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process in October 2016 the immigration service undertook a review of this policy.  This review is being finalised and decisions on foot of it will be made in the near future.  While it would be premature at this stage to outline the details of the proposed scheme, the Deputy will appreciate that it is reasonable that persons seeking to retire in the State should have a close association with Ireland, that they can fully support themselves while resident here and that they should be approved for this purpose before taking up residence.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State in May 2015 as a visitor and subsequently applied to the immigration authorities to remain in Ireland as a retired person.  After due consideration of all the circumstances in this case this request was refused because the person concerned did not satisfy all the conditions for settling in the State as a retired person as set out in the policies set out by INIS.  This decision was subsequently reviewed twice at the request of the person concerned and the original decision was upheld on both occasions.  In August 2016 this person was granted a short period of permission to remain in the State for medical reasons and after voluntarily leaving the State at the end of 2016, was subsequently granted temporary permission to re-enter the State in March 2017 for a specific period in order to attend a specific medical appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Facilities","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[13001\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to close or move the training unit in operation in Mountjoy Prison; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service has commenced the repurposing of the Training Unit Place of Detention (on the Mountjoy Prison Campus) to a dedicated Unit for older prisoners.<\/p><p>  A key action of the current Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan (Action 2.5) is to ensure that older prisoners are identified as a specific group who have particular needs within the prison population.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, some 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.<\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

In this regard, the Policing Plan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised crime activity including drug crime.  I am advised that the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies.  The Bureau continues its policy of working with Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.<\/p><p>  I am advised that community policing continues to be a key aspect of the Garda approach to the prevention and detection of crime.  Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of community based groups, as well in more formal settings such as Joint Policing Committees, to ensure that local issues can be aired and appropriate partnerships formed with communities to address matters of concern.  Garda&iacute; also support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons.  In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities.<\/p><p>On 9 June 2016, the Garda Commissioner launched a five year programme to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure that it can meet present and future policing and security challenges.  An important principle included in the plan is increased Garda visibility, with crime prevention being the number one priority. The Garda modernisation plan was developed with the benefit of inputs from Garda personnel and community stakeholders, as well as the experience of police forces in other jurisdictions.  The measures in the plan also respond to reports and recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<\/p><p>In conclusion, all Garda activities, including community policing, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000, so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD05200"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[13016\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100065#WRD05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to replace or upgrade the PULSE system (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1363","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda equipment and resources, including ICT, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 is intended to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the organisation can meet present and future challenges.

Under section 142 the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator may also prepare and publish, for the guidance of Legal Costs Adjudicators, legal practitioners and the public, guidelines on the manner in which the functions of the Legal Costs Adjudicators are to be performed.  For the first time in legislation, Schedule 1 of the 2015 Act sets out the Principles Relating to Legal Costs that are to be applied under section 155 in the adjudication of legal costs by a Legal Costs Adjudicator while also having regard to such matters as whether the work claimed was actually and appropriately done, was reasonably charged and the costs concerned reasonably incurred.  It should also be noted that a number of the new provisions contained in Part 10 of the 2015 Act will also apply to legal costs determinations carried out by County Registrars.<\/p>  <p>  While the Legal Costs Regulatory Authority will not assume any of the current functions of the Taxing-Master it will, under the new complaints regime contained in Part 6 of the 2015 Act, continue to provide an opportunity for the informal resolution of more minor legal costs disputes between legal practitioners and their clients at what might best be described as the consumer level.  This facility is intended to allow more minor legal costs matters to be resolved informally at the invitation of the Regulatory Authority without incurring the substantial costs and time that would arise under a full and formal referral to the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.  However, it should be noted that this informal process is not intended to deal with more serious legal costs disputes or to deal with the charging of \"grossly excessive\" fees the charging of which could, under section 50 of the 2015 Act, be considered to amount to professional misconduct by a solicitor or a barrister.<\/p>  <p>  The current working focus remains very much on the phased commencement of the respective sections or Parts of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and the effective roll-out of the key functions concerned over the coming period.  Some of these functions such as the holding of public consultations on Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain aspects of the work of barristers under sections 118 to 120 of the Act have already commenced.  The Chairperson and members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Interim Chief Executive and my Department are working closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of the necessary steps and commencements by the Department, and the delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various remaining provisions concerned.  The changeover to the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will, therefore, come into effect with the commencement of the relevant provisions of Part 10 of the 2015 Act. This is something for which detailed preparation is already being made by a specifically tasked joint working group chaired by my Department in conjunction with the Courts Service that is working to map out and oversee the various practical steps that have to be taken to get the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators up and running.  This work is also intended to ensure that the relevant new legal costs adjudication processes, documentation, rules of court and IT systems can be put in place in a legally robust manner.  Certain transitional arrangements that will apply to the coming on stream of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators and the modalities of processing any matters which may already have been referred for a taxation of legal costs are set out in sections 164 and 165 of the 2015 Act.  In broad terms, this will be done on the basis that such referrals will be dealt with in accordance with the applicable law as it stood when they were initially made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100066#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100066#WRE04200"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[13449\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100066#WRE04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Part 7 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 relating to enduring powers of attorney shall be commenced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties and is being commenced on a phased basis.

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division.<\/p>  <p>  Rathdowney Garda Station forms part of the Portlaoise Garda District which is within the wider Laois\/Offaly Garda Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Laois\/Offaly Division on the 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 296 and the strength of Portlaoise District was 162 of which 2 were assigned to Rathdowney Garda Station.  There are also 19 Garda Reserves and 23 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 29 of whom have been assigned to the Laois\/Offaly Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda resources to specific areas, but I am assured that Garda management constantly monitor the distribution of resources in the light of crime trends and overall policing needs.  As the Deputy is aware, very significant resources have been provided to the Garda authorities, including an overtime allocation of &euro;88.5 million in the current year, to support large-scale policing operations, including Operation Thor.  If I might illustrate the scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime &ndash; under Operation Thor we have seen more than 67,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide, and in the region of 4,000 arrests connected to a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p><p>Operation Thor has particularly targeted mobile gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes and it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  In fact, CSO figures for the Kerry Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 56% in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, coinciding with the introduction of Operation Thor.<\/p><p>As part of the concerted strategy to combat burglary, I made it a priority to secure the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; to support prosecutions arising from Operation Thor.  The reduction in the volume of burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the overall detection rate for burglary.  However, I might add that the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links ('hits') between people and unsolved crimes, including burglaries.

In that context, I published the Bail (Amendment) Bill in December 2016, to provide for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders and to strengthen Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  Within that constitutional framework, and in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government, the new Bail Bill will improve the operation of the Bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail while also safeguarding the rights of the individual.   <\/p>  <p>  The new Bill specifically provides that the courts must have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail; it expands the conditions which a court may impose when granting bail, including a conditions requiring an accused person not to have contact with the victim of the alleged offence or any member of the victim&rsquo;s family and the imposition of a curfew.  The Bail Bill will also provide that electronic monitoring may be imposed as a bail condition if the prosecution applies to the court for that condition.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Bill will give the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na new powers of arrest without warrant for a breach of bail conditions where it is necessary to arrest the person immediately to prevent absconding or to prevent harm, interference or intimidation to the victim or a witness.<\/p>  <p>  There are also existing legislative provisions which provide for the monitoring and management of sex offenders following release from prison.  Under the Sex Offenders Act 2001, convicted sex offenders must notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their name and address as well as any subsequent changes to those details.  The 2001 Act also provides for monitoring of certain sex offenders including through post release supervision by the Probation Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100068#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Remuneration","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100068#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[14568\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100068#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will confirm that no Minister or Minister of State under her remit since 2011 has claimed overnight expenses for staying in Dublin.","asker":"1349","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>I can confirm that no overnight expense for staying in Dublin has been paid from my Department's Vote to a Minister or Minister of State during the period since 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100068#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100068#WRG00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100068#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[12966\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100068#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if diagnosed severe autism will be included on the criteria for a primary medical certificate.","asker":"1225","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":380,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (up to a certain limit), an exemption from motor tax and\u00a0a\u00a0grant\u00a0in respect of fuel, on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities. <\/p><p>To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.

However, despite the absence of complete information for 2015 onwards, Revenue has also advised that there is more timely information available on claims in respect of PAYE taxpayers in employment.\u00a0 That data reflects the number of PAYE taxpayers with the incapacitated child tax credit on their record, irrespective of whether the taxpayer has the earning capacity to use some or all of the credit.<\/p><p>The comparison of the published website data (PAYE and self-employed taxpayers who have used all or some of the incapacitated child credit) up to 2014, and provisional data for PAYE taxpayers only up to 2017, is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>PAYE taxpayers in employment with the credit on their record<\/th><th>PAYE and self-employed taxpayers: claims giving rise to a cost to the Exchequer\u00a0 (years for which complete data is available)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>14,682<\/td><td>17,700<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>15,292<\/td><td>20,300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>15,673<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>15,890<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>15,893<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The entitlement to the dependent relative tax credit is provided for in section 466 of the TCA 1997.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The dependent relative tax credit is &euro;70 for 2017.\u00a0 However, if the income of the dependent relative exceeds the maximum amount payable for the State Pension (Contributory) plus an additional &euro;280 in the year of assessment, which amounts to &euro;14,504 for 2017, there is no entitlement to the credit.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The conditions for entitlement to the tax credit are that an individual must prove that he or she maintains, at his\/her own expense, a:<\/p><p>- relative, including a relative of his spouse or civil partner, who is unable due to old age or infirmity to maintain him\/herself,<\/p><p>- widowed parent of the claimant or of the claimant's spouse or civil partner, whether incapacitated or not, or<\/p><p>- son or daughter, or a child of his\/her civil partner who resides with the claimant and on whose services the claimant is compelled to depend on due to old age or infirmity.<\/p><p>The dependent relative tax credit cannot be claimed for a child if the incapacitated child tax credit is claimed.

Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code now requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the regulated entity that will be 'servicing' the loan for the unregulated entity.

I have been informed by the Central Bank that in relation to the holding of AGMs by credit unions in accordance with Section 78(2) of the 1997 Act, the Central Bank works closely with credit unions on a case by case basis to resolve any regulatory issues arising before a credit union holds its AGM.  In this regard the Central Bank suggests that members should seek information from their individual credit union regarding the proposed timing of their AGM.  Under section 78(4) of the 1997 Act the Central Bank may direct a credit union to postpone, for a period not exceeding nine months, the holding of the AGM.\u00a0 However, the Central Bank informs me that at present, no credit union has been directed by the Central Bank to postpone the holding of their AGM.\u00a0 I have been further informed by the Central Bank that\u00a0as at 31 January 2017, there were 13 credit unions that had not held AGMs for more than 9 months.

Where taxpayers minimise their tax liabilities or, as is alleged in the case of the poultry sector, use the interaction of the flat-rate scheme for farmers and the normal VAT system to maximise their level of VAT input recovery and do so within the law no 'overclaiming' of VAT on input costs arises.  Unregistered farmers apply a flat-rate addition to the value of the agricultural goods or services supplied to a VAT registered business; they cannot apply a higher rate than that provided in law or apply it to a value other than the price charged for the supply of the goods or services.  It follows that they cannot at a later date seek to adjust upwards the amount of the flat-rate addition added at the time of the supply. <\/p>  <p>  The flat-rate addition, currently 5.4%, is reviewed each year and adjusted where necessary to ensure that farmers that are not registered for VAT are compensated at the aggregate level for the unrecoverable VAT borne on their input costs. <\/p>  <p>  However, while business structures and contractual arrangements in an agricultural sector may be lawful they are not acceptable if they result in a systematic overcompensation of farmers for the VAT borne on their input costs.\u00a0 Accordingly, when this matter was brought to my attention I introduced a provision in Finance Act 2016 that enables me to exclude, by Ministerial Order, any specified agricultural sector where the business structures or models employed result in a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments over input costs borne by flat-rate farmers within that sector.  If it proves necessary to do so, I fully intend to make any order required to exclude any sector from the flat rate scheme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While there is evidence that business structures and contractual arrangements have emerged in the poultry sector that would be likely to result in an excess of flat rate addition payments to farmers over the VAT borne on their input costs, no economic analysis of the level of VAT recovery in the poultry sector has been undertaken.  With regard to the question about 'artificially inflating feed prices', the Deputy will be aware that prices are a matter to be agreed between buyers and sellers and that sellers will be in a position to point to a range of factors influencing price levels, including quality, consistency, traceability, etc. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by The Revenue Commissioners that following enactment of the provision referred to above officials met with the Irish Farmers Association and are in the process of meeting relevant parties in the poultry sector to establish if they plan to unwind any structures and arrangements that are designed or likely to give rise to overcompensation of farmers for the VAT borne on their input costs.  If Revenue is not satisfied that any such structures and arrangements will be unwound within an acceptable timeframe they will complete a review of the sector as provided for in Section 86A of the VAT Consolidation Act, 2010 (inserted by Section 47 of Finance Act 2016).  I gave a commitment at Report Stage in the D&aacute;il when discussing this provision that I would provide the industry with adequate time to make the necessary changes to their business models and that I did not envisage making a Ministerial Order to exclude any particular sector from the flat-rate scheme until the latter part of 2017. I intend to honour that commitment, but I also want to reiterate my commitment to make such an Order if it proves necessary to do so.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to other agricultural sectors, I am not aware of any evidence that similar structures and contractual arrangements have been put in place. I am advised by Revenue that it is enquiring into business practices in other agricultural sectors for evidence of such business structures and have asked the Irish Farmers Association to advise them if they become aware of any such structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100069#WRH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100069#WRH01250"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[13299\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100069#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if each State supported bank offers, in certain circumstances, an interest rate to an existing mortgage customer which is outside of the advertised rates for that particular category of customer including, for example, in a situation in which a customer has informed the bank that he or she is switching to another lender; if the Central Bank has a view on this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, as I advised in my responses to PQ numbers 130 and 156 of 14 February 2017 and PQ number 170 of 7 March 2017, Section 865 (4) of the TCA provides that that right is subject to the making of a claim within a statutory limit of four years after the end of the chargeable period to which the claim relates.  That statutory limit is binding on Revenue as well as on the taxpayer.  Decisions of the Tax Appeals Commission in differing appellant circumstances published recently have confirmed that there is no discretion in the application of the 4 year rule for claiming repayments.<\/p>  <p>  Section 865 TCA was introduced in 2003 and provides a statutory general right to repayment of tax as well as payment of interest, subject to a four year time limit.\u00a0 It provides that no repayment may be made based on claims submitted more than four years after the end of the period to which they relate.  Prior to that there was no statutory right to repayment, though a taxpayer could sue for repayment under common law.\u00a0 The Minister at the time indicated that, in introducing the new arrangements, he was satisfied that they achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while providing necessary protection for the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, the general right of the Revenue Commissioners to raise assessments or make enquiries as respects taxpayer returns was also reduced to four years though in certain circumstances, for example where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules, Revenue's right to enquire or raise assessments is not time limited.  Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years.  The convergence of these various time limits on four years creates parity between a taxpayer's right to repayment and Revenue's powers to raise assessments. <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the decision of the High Court regarding the deductibility against rental profits of the NPPR charge has been appealed by Revenue to the Court of Appeal.

Any repayment claims made in relation to this matter that are received within the statutory time limits, as they apply to each year of assessment, will be retained and processed when the outcome of the Appeal case is known.

As a result, where properties and assets over which NAMA holds a charge are being sold, the sales process is managed by the property owner or by a receiver.  NAMA does not manage the sales process, but NAMA guidelines require that a property is openly marketed, with the property owner or receiver appointing a sales agent to market the property and ensure that the sale is conducted in an open and transparent manner.  As secured lender, NAMA's approval of the sale is required before its security can be released to complete the sale. <\/p><p>NAMA's Business Plan, which was published in July 2010, stated that NAMA would engage proactively with Government departments, local authorities, State agencies and other appropriate bodies in relation to their possible need for land\/properties.\u00a0 The NAMA Board formally approved a policy in relation to open marketing exceptions in 2014 and since then all exceptions have been logged.  I am advised that since January 2014, 240 exceptions to NAMA's open marketing policy have been approved and the aggregate value of these transactions to date is &euro;1.2 billion, which is\u00a0less than 6%\u00a0of total disposal proceeds since January 2014.  Such derogations are dependent on achieving the current market value as determined by independent market\u00a0valuations.<\/p><p>I am further advised that NAMA Board policy in relation to exceptions provides for four exceptions to its policy of open marketing:<\/p><p>1.

Such assets are offered at the appraised market value confirmed by way of independent valuation report received by NAMA. <\/p><p>2. Where a government or State entity has approached NAMA to purchase an asset for legitimate reasons in the public interest.  Such derogations are dependent on achieving the current market value as determined by an independent valuation.<\/p><p>3.\u00a0Where NAMA, through NARPS, acquires assets for social housing purposes from NAMA debtors or receivers for onward leasing to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).\u00a0 Such derogations are dependent on achieving the current market value as determined by an independent valuation<\/p><p>4. Where the asset is the subject of a compulsory purchase order (CPO) by a State body or local authority.<\/p><p>Included in the <b>first exceptions category<\/b>are transactions which resulted in full redemption of par debt, transactions involving defective security and transactions involving the sale of assets where there were legal impediments to open market sales. These included cases involving existing ownership agreements and third parties with legal entitlements or pre-emption rights relating to the assets.  Table 1 provides a breakdown by sub-category. NAMA's primary objective under the NAMA Act is to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State and in cases where it can be demonstrated that the best achievable price for an asset will not be achieved on the open market, derogation from NAMA's open marketing policy is sought from the appropriate delegated authority.  Such assets are offered at the appraised market value confirmed by way of independent valuation report received by NAMA.  The total value of transactions in this category was &euro;795m.<\/p><p>The <b>second exceptions category <\/b>relates to cases where State bodies require certain property assets in the public interest.  This includes the sale of sites to the Department of Education for the provision of primary and secondary schools and properties and sites sold to local authorities and to various Government departments and State agencies.  This category also\u00a0includes sites identified by IDA Ireland as suitable for Foreign Direct Investment. Derogations\u00a0are applied in instances where the purchaser\u00a0is an existing tenant or where an existing business\u00a0is looking to expand into an adjoining NAMA-secured property or site.  Again, such derogations are dependent on achieving the current market value as determined by an independent valuation.

Since the start of 2012, NAMA has identified 6,941 houses and apartments controlled by its debtors and receivers as available for social housing.  Of these, 2,748 properties have been confirmed as suitable by local authorities. NAMA, through its special purpose vehicle, NARPS, purchased properties from its debtors and receivers for onward long-term leasing to local authorities or AHBs.  In addition, AHBs directly purchased residential properties for social housing purposes. In total, social housing transactions valued at &euro;149m have received derogation from NAMA's policy of open marketing.

For a purchaser buying a new build, the first major expenditure is the point at which they enter into a contract to purchase and pay over the full\u00a0deposit.\u00a0I am advised by Revenue that from their discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, their understanding of the usual purchase process involves the payment of\u00a0a 2 per cent booking deposit, followed by the payment of the balance to bring the deposit up to\u00a010 per cent of the purchase price\u00a0upon the signing of the contract.  The timing of the payment of this deposit is a matter between the purchaser and seller but it is only when a contract has been entered into that a claim can be made for the tax refund under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  For a self-build property, the first major expenditure point usually coincides with\u00a0the draw down of the\u00a0first tranche of the relevant\u00a0mortgage, and thus the refund is payable at this point in respect of self builds.  The Help to Buy refund is worth 5 per cent of the value of the property, up to certain limits, and the legislation provides that it is a credit against the purchase of the new home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100070#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100070#WRJ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[13793\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100070#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a newly developed graveyard becomes exempt from 13.5% VAT once it is five years old; the person or body that pays the 13.5% VAT on the grave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Government recognises this and has put in place a number of measures to ensure that credit unions can continue to provide\u00a0services to their\u00a0members and to ensure the stability of the sector into the future.  These measures include: <\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions;<\/p>  <p>  - the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012;<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board   ReBo;<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of a stabilisation levy to support credit unions that are undercapitalised but are otherwise viable;<\/p>  <p>  - the availability of &euro;250 million of exchequer funding for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by\u00a0ReBo; <\/p>  <p>  - the availability of &euro;250 million of exchequer funding for resolution purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Most of these measures stemmed from recommendations made in 2012 by the Commission on Credit Unions in its final report and were implemented over\u00a0five years with the\u00a0objective of\u00a0developing a strengthened and revitalised credit union sector to ensure\u00a0it is\u00a0in a position to play an increasing role in the\u00a0financial landscape of the future in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from this, in December 2015,  I invited the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) to carry out a review of the implementation of those recommendations set out in the report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  On 29 June 2016 I was presented with a\u00a0report by CUAC which provides\u00a0an in-depth analysis of the sector from a financial perspective\u00a0and from a stakeholder perspective based on discussions with a wide range of stakeholders.  This approach\u00a0ensured a balanced report from CUAC providing focused and effective recommendations.

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.<\/p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS School Support Programme.<\/p><p>Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools. <\/p><p>Schools which have not been included or upgraded at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification process, which is fair and objective.<\/p><p>The DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to <i><\/i><\/p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.

Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Accommodation","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[14148\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the disparity between rents being charged in private purpose built student accommodation (details supplied) and the average rent which DIT estimate students currently pay, which is &euro;348 per month; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[14149\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated number of beds in purpose built student accommodation that are currently let to students in receipt of a partial or full student grant, students paying EU fees and students paying international fees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[14150\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the disparity between rents being charged in private purpose built student accommodation (details supplied) and the full maintenance grant, which is less than one quarter of the annual rent charged for such purpose built student accommodation; his views on whether this will be a further impediment to access third level education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241, 242 and 388 together.<\/p><p>Firstly, I should point out that the student maintenance grant is a contribution towards the living costs of a student.  It is not intended to cover the full costs of attending college.  The student grant scheme does however, provide for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.<\/p><p>Secondly, and turning specifically to the area of Student Accommodation, the Deputy will be aware of the HEA report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, published by my predecessor in 2015. <\/p><p>Subsequent to this, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, on 19 July 2016 published <i>&ldquo;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rdquo;, <\/i>following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at: <i><\/i><\/p><p>My Department worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in developing this Plan, with a specific focus on student accommodation.<\/p><p>Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector and this was delivered, with the publication of the Strategy for the Rental Sector.  The Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.  Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of 3 years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017. <\/p><p>The most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long-term is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of all types of housing.  As outlined in the Action Plan for Education 2017 which was published on 6 February 2017 and in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland <\/i>Action Plan, my officials have been working closely with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with other relevant stakeholders with a view to implementing all of the relevant actions in relation to student accommodation that were detailed in <i>Rebuilding Ireland.  <\/i>This includes the development of a national student accommodation strategy which is due for completion in Q2 2017 and which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of student accommodation.<\/p><p>Finally, the information requested by the Deputy, regarding the number of beds in purpose built student accommodation that are currently let to students in receipt of a partial or full student grant, students paying EU fees and students paying international fees, is not collected by my Department and would require a disproportionate amount of time and resources to compile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Education Review","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01350"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[12804\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when new arrangements for the NCSE model for special education needs in schools will be released to primary schools in view of the fact the deadline was February 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools and 0014\/2017 for post primary schools have been published.<\/p><p>These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.<\/p><p>The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.<\/p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p><p>Allocations based on the school profiles have been issued to all schools and details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.<\/p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. <\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. <\/p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  This includes provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school. <\/p><p>The new allocations to schools will include provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school. <\/p><p>All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. <\/p><p>For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. <\/p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>.  Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. <\/p><p>Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. <\/p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p><p>The model will allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.<\/p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01550"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[12850\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the length of time a school building project (details supplied) has been at stage 2B, detailed design; the average time a new school construction project spends at stage 2B; the cause of the delay in this project build; when he envisages construction will be begin on this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[12851\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the name of the architect on a school building project (details supplied); the amount being spent on the architectural process; if the spend on architectural services for this project will run over the initial budget; if so, the amount by which it will run over; the justification for any overspend; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.<\/p><p>The major building project to which the Deputy refers was authorised to progress to Stage 2b (Detailed design) in December 2014.

Since 2011 over 35,000 learners have participated on programmes in areas of key skill shortages. These include ICT, advanced manufacturing (including engineering, bio-pharma and med tech), financial services and construction. \u00a0<\/p><p>In 2017 the programme is being expanded and manufacturing programmes will be open to people irrespective of their employment status; previously you needed to be unemployed to access these courses in Springboard+.  The purpose of the change is to continue to address key skill shortages by providing focussed industry-related courses, even as the numbers on the Live Register continue to fall. <\/p><p>The ICT programmes provided under Springboard+, including a part-time ICT Conversion Programme, introduced in 2016 and open to people irrespective of their employment status, forms part of a suite of measures to increase the supply of ICT graduates as part of the implementation of the ICT Skills Action Plan 2014 - 2018.  In addition to the targeted Springboard+ ICT courses,\u00a0HEA funds additional places on mainstream\u00a0Computer Science courses at Level 8.Institutions have been allocated &euro;2,000 per additional place.  In 2016 an additional 400 places were funded.  The Information Technology Investment Fund (ITIF) continues to support HEI ICT programme retention, and provides annual block funding to HEIs, (&euro;80,000 for Universities and &euro;54,000 for IOTs).  HEIs allocate this funding across their specific retention activities.  Activities are focused on integration of incoming students, supports and facilities for all students, and targeted activities for students experiencing difficulties. <\/p><p>Reports covering activity in 2016, detail over 100 specific retention supports delivered to ICT students.  These include learning support centres; additional tutorials over the summer and weekends; peer mentoring; staff retention seminars; group building initiatives; maths learning supports; and improved infrastructure.  The Fund also supports the provision on Computer Science Summer Camps for second level students.  In 2016\u00a0 29 camps were funded nationally facilitating over 1,245 students.  Each HEI was awarded &euro;5,000 to support camps programmes. Camps typically target transition year students and run for a week.  A particular focus is placed on the inclusion of girls, with some girls&rsquo; only camps.  In 2016 over 40% of participants were female.  The aim of the camps is to foster an interest in Computer Science as a potential third level option for second level students.  HEI computing departments are centrally involved in supporting coder dojos, providing facilities to host dojos, third level computing students to run clubs and lecturers to provide mentoring strategies.  HEIs link their computing camps and computing outreach activities to coderdojo activities and use these to foster greater links with secondary schools within their region. <\/p><p>This morning (March 20th), Minister Halligan and I announced additional funding of &euro;2.25 Million to boost ICT Skills development with additional summer camps for second level students being developed, as well as up to 700 additional places on ICT courses. <\/p><p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) will write to higher education institutions to seek proposals for three calls:<\/p><p>- Additional ICT Summer Camps for second level students, <\/p><p>- Additional undergraduate places on core level 8 full-time courses <\/p><p>- A call for full-time level 9 MSc computing courses.<\/p><p>The promotion of STEM careers\u00a0to students is\u00a0part of the\u00a0remit of Science Foundation Ireland\u00a0who manage the SmartFutures initiative.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100071#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100072#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[13002\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100072#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which a person(details supplied) can continue education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":628,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to ensuring that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.<\/p>  <p>  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of children with ASD who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.

This will involve the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase, as the State&rsquo;s local education authorities, identifying areas where there is likely to be demand for greater diversity and they will work with pre-school services to establish evidence of this demand among the cohort of pre-school parents.  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will prepare a report for my Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent and separate implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests, including parents and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and co-operation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  \u00a0In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.\u00a0In the final instance, an application for a formal transfer of patronage will have to be made by the existing patron under the Education Act 1998, which will require Ministerial approval.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases the owner of the land on which the school stands.  My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.  I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons.<\/p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.  I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons.  I believe that the new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system.  In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working constructively with all education stakeholders and patron bodies in this important endeavour and I would ask all parties to put aside sectional or self interest in pursuing the national objective of providing greater diversity of school provision in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100072#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100072#WRL01950"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[13110\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100072#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will allocate direct once-off funding to the Mayo campus in Castlebar of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, similar to the Killybegs campus in Donegal to the tune of &euro;3 million, in order that the Mayo campus can invest in developing new courses.

My Department allocates the recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to the HEA designated higher education institutions including the Institutes of Technology (IoTs) such as Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT).  The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution.  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day to day affairs, including the allocation of all of its income (both public and private).  They are also responsible for the provision and management of courses at their institution.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by a number of the Institutes of Technology (IoTs) including GMIT.  The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular are working closely with those Institutes operating in deficit to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the HEA's policy for dealing with financially vulnerable institutes, GMIT has agreed a 3 year financial plan with the HEA to reach a balanced budget by 2017\/18 and an external financial expert has been appointed to review the plan.  GMIT has also identified a number of areas to address their financial position including implementation of a retention strategy, review of offering versus other HEIs to try to increase demand and new programme development to bring increased student numbers.<\/p>  <p>  The HEA and GMIT Governing Body have\u00a0re-confirmed\u00a0to\u00a0my Department their commitment to\u00a0implementing a viable development plan for the Castlebar campus as part of this process.

Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.\u00a0This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including\u00a0where\u00a0a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or\u00a0where there are\u00a0newly\u00a0enrolling pupils\u00a0to the school. <\/p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. <\/p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE\u00a0has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie. \u00a0Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will\u00a0allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.

We know that schools\u00a0have done\u00a0this well. <\/p>  <p>  We also know that under the pilot of the new allocation model that was conducted in 2015\/16 that schools welcomed the discretion that they had to allocate resources under the new allocation model to\u00a0pupils based on their individual learning needs, as opposed to primarily based on a diagnosis of\u00a0a disability.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A category of disability, by itself, does not identify how much support a child should receive &ndash; two students, with the same disability can need completely different levels of support. <\/p>  <p>  Schools use their own knowledge of their students to allocate teaching supports and they can also call on a wide number of support services to assist them. These include the Visiting Teacher Service, NEPS, Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) and other support services such a  the Special Educational Support Services. Under the new allocation\u00a0model, schools will continue to receive guidance when making decisions about supporting students&rsquo; learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on supporting children with special educational needs under the new allocation model are also currently being prepared and will be published shortly.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new model, schools will be guided as to how to identify pupils for additional teaching support and how to prioritise pupils for support taking into account the extent of their learning needs in order to ensure the appropriate level of support is being given to the child. Schools should inform parents about this process and how to request a review of their child&rsquo;s additional teaching support, if this is required. <\/p>  <p>  However, despite these measures, some parents, might still disagree with the level of support being given to their child. In such cases parents should discuss this first with their child&rsquo;s class\/subject teacher or his\/her support teacher. <\/p>  <p>  If parents remain unhappy with the level of support being given to their child in a school they may then raise this issue with the school principal and if necessary, at a later point with the Chairperson of the school Board of Management, who are the body which has responsibility for the management of the school.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines for Schools Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools, which are due to be published \u00a0shortly will support schools in identifying and addressing the needs of children with special education needs and also in monitoring their deployment of resources to meet those needs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines have drawn on best practice to assist schools to allocate the greatest level of resources to the pupils with the highest levels of needs.\u00a0 The school self-evaluation process also supports schools to examine their own practices in the area of special education, to identify what is working well but also to identify areas that require improvement.\u00a0 Schools will set targets for improvement and implement agreed actions at a whole-school level.\u00a0 This process will enable schools to monitor their deployment of resources in area of special education needs.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to oversight of in the way in which resource hours are used in schools, my Departments Inspectorate operates a programme of evaluation in primary and post-primary schools.\u00a0 The range of evaluation models available to the Inspectorate regularly involves inspectors evaluating, advising and reporting on the provision for pupils with SEN at the various levels of the Continuum of Support.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Inspectorate also conducts SEN-specific evaluations at primary and at post-primary levels which allow for an in-depth focus on issues relating to special education needs.\u00a0 For example, in Evaluations of Provision for Pupils with Special Educational Needs at primary level, one area of enquiry for the inspection team is the management and use of resources received to support pupils with special educational needs.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100075#WRO06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":850,"content":"<p>Question No. 343 answered with Question No. 341.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":852,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[13596\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100075#WRO06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if additional provision has been made for special education needs co-ordination under the new resource allocation model, as recommended by his Department's inspectorate in relation to the review of the pilot; if schools are expected to provide this from within their resource allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":853,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools and 0014\/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.<\/p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p>  <p>  Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March. \u00a0Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.

Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.<\/p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.<\/p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school.<\/p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.<\/p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile.<\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.<\/p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile. This includes provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school.<\/p><p>The new allocations to schools will include provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school.<\/p><p>All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation.<\/p><p>For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations.<\/p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website:<i>www.ncse.ie. <\/i>Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017.<\/p><p>Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.<\/p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p><p>The model will allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.<\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.<\/p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools Scheme","counter":893,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP02650"},{"type":"question","counter":894,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[13727\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if further schools will be added to the DEIS programme in the coming 12 months; the process and timeframe for this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":895,"content":"<p>DEIS is my Department's main policy initiative to tackle educational disadvantage.

I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS.<\/p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":906,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03450"},{"type":"question","counter":907,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[13759\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school (details supplied) can appeal allocated hours and receive more hours with regard to the new system of special educational needs support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":908,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools and 0014\/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.<\/p><p>These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.<\/p><p>The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.<\/p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p><p>Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.<\/p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.<\/p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school.<\/p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.<\/p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile.<\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.<\/p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  This includes provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school.<\/p><p>The new allocations to schools will include provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school.<\/p><p>All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation.<\/p><p>For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations.<\/p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website:<i>www.ncse.ie.<\/i>Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017.<\/p><p>Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.<\/p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p><p>The model will allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.<\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.<\/p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":909,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03650"},{"type":"question","counter":910,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[13778\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application for additional space made by a school (details supplied) in County Tipperary; when a decision will issue on this application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":911,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of an application for additional accommodation from the school referred to.<\/p><p>The application is currently being assessed and my Department will be in direct contact with the school authority concerned\u00a0when the assessment process has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":913,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[13782\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100076#WRP03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department has a policy regarding the use of sports halls as classrooms in schools; if officials in the building unit have been advising principals to use the sports halls as classrooms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":914,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department only considers the use of Sports\/PE halls or General Purpose rooms as classrooms where an immediate accommodation need arises to cater for increased enrolments or extra staffing and it\u00a0is not possible to meet this need straight away.

At Primary level a survey of school Principals was used while at Post-Primary, a combination of data from the DES Post-Primary Pupils Database, including school-level retention rates, together with exam achievement data and exam fee waiver data, which indicated that students had a medical card, from the State Examinations Commission (SEC) was used.  The objective of both methods was to capture the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict the risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The revised identification process for DEIS 2017 is significantly more robust.

These proposals are now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rents for social housing in place across local authorities to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.<\/p>  <p>  I expect this review to be completed before the end of Quarter 2 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100078#WRRR04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Yield","counter":1021,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100078#WRRR04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1022,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[12991\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100078#WRRR04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on whether local authorities have become significantly more reliant on revenues from commercial rates in view of the fact that revenues sourced from this category constituted 29% of total revenues in 2010 but in 2015 constituted 38%of total revenue; his further views on whether local authorities should diversify their revenue income sources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1023,"content":"<p>The monetary amount of each revenue income source to local authorities in the years 2010 - 2015 is set out in Table 1.

It is important to note that the local authority funding model changed considerably as a result of the introduction of LPT\u00a0in 2013 and the establishment of Irish Water.  The Local Government Fund (LGF)\u00a0historically, through\u00a0GPG\u00a0allocations, provided local authorities with finance for funding some of their day-to-day activities, including elements of water services costs; for non-national roads; and funding for certain local government initiatives.<\/p><p>The Government decided in the context of Budget 2014 that the former water-related elements of GPGs should continue to contribute to the water services costs that were previously met by local authorities.  GPG allocations from the LGF\u00a0to local authorities in 2013 were &euro;641m and in 2014 were &euro;281.25m.  These figures recognise the removal of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014 and local authority allocations are therefore not directly comparable to previous years. In 2015, LPT allocations (which replaced GPGs) to local authorities amounted to &euro;458.8m. <\/p><p>LPT was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions and giving greater funding certainty for the sector through removing the reliance on other taxes, which may fluctuate according to economic circumstances.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide\u00a0as to how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process.<\/p><p>Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides local authority members with the power to vary the rates of LPT in their areas from 2015 onwards by up to 15%.  If an authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate upwards (by up to 15%) it retains 100% of the resultant additional income collected in that area. Likewise, if the rate is reduced, the authority forgoes the full amount of the reduced income collected.  Fewer local authorities decided to lower their LPT rates for 2017 than was the case for 2016, illustrating\u00a0a growing appreciation of the link between service provision, LPT income and the budgetary process. Limerick, Wexford and Galway County became the first local authorities to use their power to vary the LPT rate upwards for 2017, thereby gaining a combined &euro;3.6m in additional LPT income for the delivery of local services in their areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100078#WRRR04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":1024,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100078#WRRR04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1025,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[13020\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100078#WRRR04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has analysed the optimum mix of social and private housing dwellings in large scale developments such as strategic development zones in terms of social cohesion, the tipping point for private buyers to purchase in such schemes, the average income levels sufficient to attract retail and other pull services; if his attention has been drawn to international evidence in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1363","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1026,"content":"<p>Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will apply to each individual application or applications for permission for housing in a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ), or any other large development, which should lead to 10% social housing in the development in question. <\/p>  <p>  The acquisition of further social housing units, beyond the Part V requirement, in an SDZ or other development is a matter for the relevant housing authority in the first instance, subject to the policy of sustainable communities, which aims to ensure the provision of a choice of house type, size and tenure within a single neighbourhood.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of this policy is to avoid the significant effects of social isolation and limiting of opportunities that can occur with large mono - tenure estates, frequently necessitating significant\u00a0regeneration and remediation proposals at a later stage,\u00a0at considerable cost.

Under Rebuilding Ireland, it is envisaged that all long-term Rent Supplement recipients will be transferred to the HAP scheme by 2020.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection may request long-term recipients of Rent Supplement to contact their local authority in order to have their housing need assessed, which could potentially allow them to access HAP. Local authorities are working closely with local Department of Social Protection staff to transfer eligible households from the Rent Supplement scheme to HAP.  The phased process of transferring households from Rent Supplement to HAP, which only begins after the scheme has been introduced and established in a local authority area for some months, is carefully managed in order to ensure that no gaps in support arise within the transfer process. <\/p><p>Following the commencement of the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, HAP is considered to be a social housing support and consequently, households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that households on the waiting list who avail of HAP might have expectations that they would receive an allocated form of social housing support, Ministerial Directions were issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP tenants can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.  With the completion of the HAP rollout and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase, I recently signed a Ministerial Direction instructing local authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list.  This refreshed direction ensures that following completion of the HAP pilot phase, HAP tenants still get all the benefits of HAP and are no less likely to get a different form of social housing support.<\/p><p>The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.  I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of the option to be placed on a transfer list.

The HSE operates under the remit of my colleague,\u00a0the Minster for Health. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister with policy and legislative responsibility for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, I am primarily concerned that local authority provided fire services are meeting their statutory obligations in respect of provision of fire services and fire safety.  These responsibilities include the important activity of community and other fire safety initiatives as well as response to 999\/112 calls.  In 2013, the policy document &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo; was published and, for the first time, set out standards and norms against which local authorities can benchmark their fire services.  In April 2016, the first report of the External Validation Group, titled &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency&rdquo;, was published.  This report assessed the review process undertaken in each of the 27 local authority fire services, and provided an appraisal of the current state of our local authority fire services. <\/p>  <p>  In general, there is a high degree of collaboration and co-ordination of emergency activity among the Principal Emergency Services.  In some circumstances, the HSE&rsquo;s NAS calls for assistance from fire services in responding to certain categories of 999\/112 emergency calls.  Such calls are typically in respect of, but not limited to, ECHO (life threatening) emergencies.  As well as being able to call on Community First Responders, the NAS is aware that many fire services are equipped with automatic external defibrillators and have trained their fire-fighters in Cardiac First Responder and Emergency First Responder to Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council standards.  Fire services are so equipped and trained in the first instance for ensuring the health and safety of their own staff, but can use their skills and equipment where they encounter casualties at emergency incidents.<\/p>  <p>  Fire services generally respond to calls for assistance from external bodies in accordance with protocols operated within the three fire services Regional Communications Centres.  However,\u00a0 there is no national framework or agreement for cross-mobilisation between the Principal Emergency Services. <\/p>  <p>  The feasibility of fire services being commissioned by the HSE to provide a response service in support of the NAS in responding to ECHO emergency calls is currently being discussed at national level at the Fire Services National Oversight &amp;amp; Implementation Group, which consists of fire service management and staff representatives.  Any proposal emerging from these discussions will be considered in the first instance by the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management and could be used as the basis for discussions with the Health sector on this matter, if relevant. <\/p>  <p>  Experience has shown that any proposal for formalising such assistance needs to be subject to appropriate governance and cost reimbursement arrangements and to be set in the context of a service agreement which will not impact on or adversely affect fire services' primary roles.  It is important in such circumstances\u00a0to ensure that local authority and fire services' resources are not diverted from their statutory fire service and fire safety responsibilities where they are providing assistance for another public body.  The potential impact on the current\u00a0Community First Responders schemes would also have to be assessed.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100079#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":1092,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100079#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1093,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[13292\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100079#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the estimated amount it would cost to adequately upgrade the infrastructure in the wastewater plants in the 38 agglomerations across the State that are deemed to be in breach of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1094,"content":"<p>The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive mandates the required standards for the collection and treatment of waste water from urban areas and sets various deadlines for meeting these standards.

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. <\/p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.<\/p><p>The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme, having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000. My Department is working closely with local authorities to implement the scheme locally.<\/p><p>Following on from the success of the initial pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is being rolled out on a national basis from 23 February 2017. <\/p><p>I am making an additional &euro;26m available to fund the scheme in 2017, which brings the total amount available this year to &euro;32m.  This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.  This funding represents a frontloading of the &euro;140m being made available for the scheme over the next 5 years.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme.  Funding to support the cost of bringing new social houses into use using the Repair and Leasing Scheme in 2017 will be released based on proposals submitted by local authorities to my Department rather than by allocation to each local authority.  I have provided funding to support ambitious delivery under the scheme in 2017 and I would urge every local authority to work hard to secure units as early as possible and maximise the use of this investment. <\/p><p>I will be carefully monitoring the scheme in 2017 to ensure that it works well and is cost effective.  Likewise, this analysis will assist in determining its delivery potential for future years, as well as whether additional financial resources are required in that context.<\/p><p>The Repair and Leasing Scheme is one of a number of initiatives in <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>to address vacant properties around the country.  Other initiatives include the Buy and Renew Scheme.  The full details of this scheme are being finalised and will be communicated to local authorities shortly.  I have made an initial &euro;25 million available for this initiative this year and propose to increase this to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018, depending on the uptake.  I expect this investment to deliver between 400 and 500 renewed houses for social housing use.  <\/p><p>The initiative may present opportunities for local authorities and approved housing bodies to tackle dereliction in towns and urban areas, but prospective housing units will always need to be suitable for social housing use, in an area of need, and to represent reasonable value for money. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100080#WRT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":1164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100080#WRT03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1165,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[13724\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100080#WRT03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the timeframe for any forthcoming legislation to reform the commercial rates system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1166,"content":"<p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation pursuant to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.

Over 185,000 inspections have been carried out in this period.  Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations.  Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100081#WRU00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Data","counter":1195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100081#WRU00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1196,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[13972\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100081#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the fact that only 4.6 % of households spend more than 40% of their disposable income on housing, which is the fourth lowest in the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1197,"content":"<p>I note the Eurostat statistic referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a range of measures are being taken under the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>to increase housing supply overall, with the aim of creating a functioning and sustainable housing system which can meet housing demand at more affordable prices. <\/p><p>The plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system. <\/p><p>Under Pillar 2 (Accelerate Social Housing) the target is very clear &ndash; 47,000 new social housing homes to be delivered by 2021 at a cost of &euro;5.35 billion.

Of these, 2,723 were ineligible or terminated during the process, 217 have been completed, with 635 being actively progressed.  The reasons why a case has not progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body sector to increase their involvement in the scheme. <\/p><p>  Statistical information relating to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme since its inception, including a breakdown of cases by county, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at the following weblink: <i>. <\/i><\/p><p>A number of amendments were made to the MTR scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the amendments already made, the Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes.  A Review of the Mortgage to Rent Scheme was published on 8 February 2017 and represents the completion of an early action in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>.  The Review is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The Review has explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommends a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  Key actions include:<\/p><p>-Lenders will be required to formally communicate with borrowers as to why they are not suitable for the scheme. <\/p><p>-The property price threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow is being increased to &euro;365,000 (from &euro;350,000) while the threshold for an apartment \/ townhouse in these areas is being increased to &euro;310,000 (from &euro;300,000).  For the rest of the country, the threshold for a house is being increased to &euro;280,000 (from &euro;250,000) and for an apartment \/ townhouse to &euro;210,000 (&euro;190,000). <\/p><p>-Flexibility will be provided in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household will allow for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual needs of the household, with the property still being considered eligible. <\/p><p>-There are a number of actions to improve knowledge and understanding of the scheme.  A range of state agencies will be facilitated to assist and guide borrowers who could benefit from the scheme.  A Step by Step Guide for Borrowers will be produced alongside a range of other targeted information supports. <\/p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the actions put forward in the Review will make the MTR process quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgages distress.<\/p><p>In addition, the Review concludes that the current financial model of the scheme may not be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  Currently, the MTR scheme relies on Approved Housing Bodies to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.  The Government has been actively exploring potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment in social housing, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment.  A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.  <\/p><p>One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  In advance of these pilots, a targeted market testing exercise is currently underway by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), on behalf of my Department, to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a mortgage to rent cohort.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.  <\/p><p>A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.<\/p><p>The Government has also established a new Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, known as Abhaile, operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) in conjunction with the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), the Legal Aid Board and the Citizens Information Board.  The objective of the Abhaile Scheme is to ensure that a person who is at risk of losing their home due to their mortgage arrears can access independent expert financial and legal advice, which will help them to identify their best options for returning to solvency &ndash; with priority to their remaining in their home, where that is a sustainable option.

The MIS is defined by the VPSJ as &ldquo;<i>the gross income a household needs in order to reach their minimum essential standard of living<\/i>&rdquo;. <\/p><p>The VPSJ&rsquo;s <i>Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2016<\/i>(MESL) is derived from a negotiated consensus (based on focus groups with representative households, and discussions with policy-makers and experts e.g. nutritional standards)  on what people believe is a minimum.  According to the VPSJ, it is a standard of living which meets an individual's \/ household's physical, psychological and social needs, calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs.  The costs incorporate factors such as food, clothing, personal care, health, household goods, household services, communications, social inclusion, education, fuel, transport, personal costs, insurance, savings and contingencies.<\/p><p>The model developed by the VPSJ&rsquo;s produces a minimum income standard which is dependent on whether the household is, among other factors:  <\/p><p>(i)in a rural or urban location (the main differences are that transport and fuel costs are judged to be higher in rural locations); <\/p><p>(ii)  composed of a single working age person, a couple, a single- or two-parent family, a single pensioner or a pensioner couple; and <\/p><p>(iii) living in private rented accommodation, social housing or is an owner-occupier.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the MESL for welfare households assumes that households are eligible for a medical card, and as such, health and insurance costs are reduced accordingly, although the cost of over-the-counter medicines and prescription charges remains.  While the model assumes that pensioners have the Free Travel pass and the Household Benefits package, it does not assume this for working age.  It should be noted that certain working age recipients of welfare payments do qualify for Free Travel e.g. all recipients of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.<\/p><p>The costing outlined below is based on the following assumptions:<\/p><p>(i) The minimum income standards used for the costings are those for urban locations;<\/p><p>(ii) Housing costs are not taken into account as these are provided for separately in the model and vary significantly depending on a household&rsquo;s circumstances.  It should be noted that weekly depending on housing types or costs.  A range of schemes, such as Rent Supplement, the Housing Assistance Payment, Rental Accommodation Scheme and the differential rent scheme are available to assist with certain types of housing costs.<\/p><p>The Minimum Income figures used in this costing are from the <i>Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2016 <\/i>(the latest publication available), and its Appendices, and the costings are based on 2017 estimated recipient numbers.  I understand that the VPSJ will publish a 2017 MESL update later this year.<\/p><p>Children:<\/p><p>The cost of a child in 2016 varies depending on the child&rsquo;s age, according to VPSJ research (Appendix 3A).  The VPSJ research places the cost of an infant at &euro;82.81, a pre-school child at &euro;50.20, a child in primary school at &euro;84.66 and a child in secondary school at &euro;132.58 per week.  These costs comprise of food, clothing, household goods, health, social inclusion, transport, education, etc.  The costs do not include childcare. <\/p><p>For the purposes of this costing exercise, a weighted average increase was calculated (based on the CSO&rsquo;s 2017 estimated population distribution by age).  Taking into account the value of the qualified child increase (&euro;29.80 per week), child benefit (&euro;140 per month) and Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance where appropriate (&euro;100 or &euro;200 per annum, depending on the age of the child), an average increase of &euro;27.61 is required to the QCI to bring the payment in line with the VSPJ&rsquo;s direct cost of a child.  <\/p><p>- The cost of increasing the qualified child increase by &euro;27.61 per week is &euro;548.88 million in a full year.  This includes the cost of increasing the Back to Work Family Dividend which is linked to the rate of the qualified child increase (&euro;12.56 million).<\/p><p>Working Age: <\/p><p>The VPSJ research finds that the minimum income standard (MIS) for a single working age adult with no children is &euro;218.64 per week (Appendix 4A).  For the costing, all weekly working age personal rates were increased to &euro;218.64 per week.  The monetary increase varies depending on the current weekly personal rate. It should be noted that the value of increases such as the Living Alone Allowance and supplementary payments, where relevant, such as the Household Benefits Package, Fuel Allowance, and Free Travel, have not been taken into account in this costing. <\/p><p>The MIS for a working age couple with no children is &euro;335.55 (Appendix 4A), which is an increase of &euro;116.91 from the single person&rsquo;s rate.  The current welfare increase for a qualified adult is &euro;124.80.  Accordingly, the qualified adult rate was not changed in this costing.<\/p><p>-  The cost of increasing all working age personal payments to &euro;218.64 per week is &euro;966.1 million in a full year.  It should be noted that this cost also includes increasing the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance age-related reduced rates to &euro;218.64 per week, at a total cost of &euro;152.32 million in a full year.<\/p><p>Pensioners:<\/p><p>The MIS for a single pensioner is &euro;221.43 and for a pensioner couple is &euro;269.85 (Appendix 7A).  Accordingly, there are no welfare increases required to reach the MIS for pensioners as current welfare payments are in excess of the MIS for this group.  <\/p><p>The table outlined the cost of index linking the State Pension, and all weekly payments to pensioners aged 66 and over (i.e. State Pension Contributory, State Pension Non Contributory, Widow\/er&rsquo;s,, Surviving Civil Partner Contributory Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance recipients aged 66 and over, Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit recipients aged 66 and over, Death Benefit Pension recipients aged 66 and Incapacity Supplement recipients aged 66 and over).  <\/p><p>The costings are based on 2017 recipient numbers, and include the cost of proportionate increases in reduced rates and the qualified adult rates of payment, where applicable.  It should be noted that the costings do not take into account changing trends (increases or decreases) in recipient numbers from 2018 onwards. <\/p><p>The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices used in the table below is sourced from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s 2017 Budget Day book.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on HHB for over 425,000 customers.  <\/p>  <p>  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Therefore anyone aged less than 70 years of age must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department or satisfy a means test in order to qualify for HHB.  <\/p>  <p>  People in receipt of HHB aged under 66 are generally in receipt of payments such as Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance or Carers.  These payment types mean that the recipients are unable to work full time and earn additional income.  This is not generally the case for people in receipt of widow&rsquo;s contributory payment who are aged less than 66.  These recipients are of working age and may take up full-time employment, at any level of remuneration, without losing entitlement to their widow&rsquo;s contributory payment.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, widow&rsquo;s pension only becomes a qualifying payment for HHB once the recipient reaches the age of 66 (State pension age) to ensure alignment with secondary benefits that are available to people in receipt of the State pension. <\/p>  <p>  The concession whereby widows aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse\/civil partner received HHB from my Department, may qualify for the package was introduced at a time when State pension age was 65 and this cohort of widows were seen as less likely to be in a position to take up employment than those of a younger age.  In many cases, such a withdrawal would only have been for a very short period, as the payment to their household would have recommenced when they reached 66.   <\/p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the concession to widows aged less than 60 or to allow recipients of widow&rsquo;s pension of any age to qualify for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 425,000 customers.  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of approx. 4% per annum. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I announced a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5 which now brings the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of over &euro;34 per month.  The value of these increases is in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to restore the telephone allowance, and have instead concentrated on increasing the basic rate of pension for all older people.  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.

This provides access for people who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to defined levels of independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  Qualification for help under the scheme is based on the applicant being (a) in mortgage arrears on their home; (b) insolvent; (c) at risk of losing their home because of their mortgage arrears; and (d) reasonably accommodated.    The primary focus is to help borrowers to put sustainable solutions in place with their lenders and wherever possible to keep them in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  To date, 5,182 vouchers have been issued in respect of 3,229 Principle Private Residences.

The income support system is underpinned by a general principle of &lsquo;one person, one payment&rsquo; even if a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  The general approach is that if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to other social security systems. <\/p>  <p>  In the past, there were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to this general principle particularly in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of one-parent family payment, widows and widowers pensioners etc. could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as illness benefit and jobseeker's benefit at half-rate at the same time.  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in relative terms than they are now. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the difficult fiscal environment in recent years and the Government's commitment to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients, the concurrent payment of half-rate illness benefit and jobseeker's benefit in addition to one-parent family payment, widows and widowers pensions etc. was discontinued from January 2012.  It is realistic and prudent to maintain the underlying principle of &lsquo;one person, one payment&rsquo; for the social welfare system.

The Citizens Information Board (CIB) assures me that there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  There will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them.  The decision was communicated by the Board to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day. <\/p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  It is worth clarifying that the new governance arrangements are not aimed at centralising the services provided by CIS and MABS.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision taken will simply reduce the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  <\/p>  <p>  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.   <\/p>  <p>  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.

It will take time to accumulate data on a sufficient number of clientswho have completed their engagement period with the service for complete and robust outcome data to be available.<\/p><p>However for 2017, my Department is publishing a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis.  The first report was published on the 17<sup>th<\/sup>January.  This report provided outcome figures such as job starts and 13 week job sustainment fees in respect of the first 1,266 jobseekers referred to the service during the period July &ndash; September 2015.  It is not intended to publish the outcomes for each contractor separately at this time, as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.  <\/p><p>The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging.  Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed people, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.<\/p><p>The first report is available on the department&rsquo;s website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The published data contains a range of information which may assist the Deputy in gaining an overview of the performance of the service to date.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100083#WRW05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":1383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100083#WRW06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1384,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[13632\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100083#WRW06100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a domiciliary care allowance for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1385,"content":"<p>As previously outlined to the Deputy my department received an application for disability allowance from this lady on 22 August 2016.  <\/p><p>On 28 February 2017 the person concerned was requested to supply supporting documentation required by the deciding officer in order to make a decision on her eligibility.

Most importantly, there will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them.  <\/p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and the Citizens Information Services (CIS), decided on 15th February 2017 to restructure the governance arrangements of these services.  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The decision was communicated by the Board to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on 15th February 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  It is worth clarifying that the new governance arrangements are not aimed at centralising the services provided by CIS and MABS.  The decision taken will simply reduce the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.   <\/p>  <p>  The restructured governance arrangements being implemented at local company board level only will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile Scheme and the remainder  &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).<\/p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, redirected to increased front-line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.   <\/p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.

Expenditure on pensions is approximately &euro;7 billion per annum.  Due to demographic changes, my Department's spending on older people is increasing year on year at an approximate rate of &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  These bands replaced the previous structure, introduced in 2000.  They more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person, and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions, subject to the safety nets in place for those with no other means.  <\/p>  <p>  Entitlement is banded based on the average yearly contributions made during a working life.  Those with a yearly average of 48+ contributions receive a 100% pension, where, for example, those with only a yearly average of 20 contributions receive an 85% pension (not means-tested). <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that reverting the contributory pension rate bands, to the percentages effective from 2000-2012, would cost over &euro;60 million next year, and this annual cost would rise at a rate of approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  If such a change was introduced, it would mainly benefit pensioners with additional income above the State pension, and not those solely dependent upon it.  It would also significantly reduce the funds available for across-the-board pension increases, which were instead introduced in the 2016 and 2017 Budgets, and which benefit all pensioners, including those most at risk of poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Reforms and increases in the pension age have safeguarded the pension system and its core rates, despite huge demographic pressures and the economic crisis.  By achieving this, even in such difficult circumstances, the Government has shown its commitment to supporting older people, as evidenced by CSO figures which show pensioners far less likely to experience consistent poverty than the general population. <\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assists qualification for a contributory payment, based on factors such as the contributions made by their spouse, and\/or other factors likely to impact upon their needs.  These include: <\/p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.<\/p>  <p>  - Widows generally qualify for a full-rate Widows Contributory Pension. <\/p>  <p>  - Increases for Qualified Adults.<\/p>  <p>  - Credits for periods of unemployment and illness. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;227 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension). <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Income Supplement Expenditure","counter":1477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1478,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[13859\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated full-year cost of extending the family income supplement payment to those engaged on job activation schemes.","asker":"1252","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1479,"content":"<p>The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is an in-work support, which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are currently over 57,000 families with more than 126,000 children in receipt of FIS.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;422 million.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount, which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of activation supports catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers.  These supports include employment schemes such as Community Employment (CE), T&uacute;s, and Gateway.  These schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping stone back to employment.  The objective of these schemes is to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities to return to the labour market.  It is possible for a household to receive a FIS payment where the spouse or partner of the FIS applicant is engaged on one of these schemes.  However, to pay FIS directly to someone who is participating in one of these schemes would reduce the incentive for that person to move off a supported employment programme and into full-time remunerative employment.   <\/p>  <p>  Research from the ESRI shows that people are better off in work, the results, based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits and taxes, suggest that more than eight out of ten of these unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40 per cent upon taking up employment.  FIS helps recipients to gain a firm foothold in work and build a better future for their families. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not have definitive up-to-date data on the household income relating to the households on the various job activation schemes.

At present, it is paid to some 425,000 customers, with expenditure estimated at &euro;232 million for 2017. <\/p>  <p>  There has been no reduction in the household benefits scheme in recent budgets.  However, there were considerable changes in the scheme in previous years, not just in terms of the various levels of benefits that have been made available under the scheme at different points in time, but also the basis upon which they are paid, e.g., whether they are a payment for units or a cash payment.    <\/p>  <p>  The cost, therefore, would depend on a number of factors, including whether all of these changes would be reversed, the particular levels of benefit which would be restored, whether there would be an adjustment for inflation, the increased claim load among those who qualify, and take-up for the various benefits.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2011 the number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance was reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  This change was effective from September 2011.  In Budget 2013 the electricity allowance was restructured and is now based on the average best rate (minus the PSO) available for 150 units per month from Electric Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and Airtricity which resulted in electricity and gas allowances rate of  &euro;35 per month or &euro;420 a year.  Based on a rate of 2,400 units a year this could give a rate of &euro;560 a year.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2007 the value of the telephone allowance was increased with general price increases from &euro;296 per annum to &euro;310.80 per annum.  Following a number of reductions in the rate, the telephone allowance element of the household benefits scheme was discontinued in 2014.  At the time it was discontinued 77 per cent of people receiving household benefits were receiving the telephone allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that restoring both these benefits to their earlier levels would be likely to cost in the region of &euro;160-&euro;190 million in a full year. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  Over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of nearly &euro;35 per month.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;227, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;238.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance last year, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  It is worth noting that the value of these increases is in excess of the value of the household benefits previously provided.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to increase the benefits under the household benefits package would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  On the occasion of the most recent budgets, the Government has chosen to concentrate resources on increasing the rate of the pension and other weekly payments.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care Provision","counter":1484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1485,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[13910\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will assess the feasibility and costs for the provision of a nationwide database that would co-ordinate services providers, both public bodies and community organisations, that provide community services, most especially for the care of the old and vulnerable, in order to properly identify and inform on persons who need help, the help that is required and the body which can and will provide that help; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1486,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a wide range of services for people growing older in Ireland and is committed to the protection and promotion of the rights of older people, their dignity, diversity and independence. <\/p><p>The specific issue raised in your parliamentary question concerning services for older people and persons deemed as vulnerable would appear to be more appropriate for my colleague, the Minister for Health and also for the HSE.  <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Projects","counter":1487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1488,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[13912\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) can be released from their obligations to Turas Nua; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1489,"content":"<p>All jobseekers referred to JobPath must have been registered as unemployed and available for work for at least 12 months.

Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to increase over time.  The cost of reversing this decision would depend, therefore, on the effective date of such a measure, and also on any resultant changes in behaviour.<\/p><p>Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy  <b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1504,"content":"<p>Question No. 577 answered with Question No. 550.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Expenditure","counter":1505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1506,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[14039\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100085#WRY03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated full-year cost of increasing the fuel allowance payment by &euro;3 and &euro;5.

A copy of my statement to the House on that date is set out below for reference.<b>Statement on behalf of the Government:<\/b><\/p><p><b>US Executive Order (27 January, 2017) by Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade<\/b><\/p><p>Ceann Comhairle, <\/p><p><b><i>Executive Order of 27 January 2017<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>I wish to address the House with regard to the matter of the Executive Order signed by President Donald J. Trump on 27 January, 2017. <\/p><p>In particular, I wish to make clear the Government&rsquo;s position on the following three issues: this Executive Order; the operation of pre-clearance facilities at both Dublin and Shannon Airports; and Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the United States.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s position on this matter is clear and was set out in my Press Statement on 29 January, 2017, immediately prior to my visit to Washington, DC, from 31 January to 2 February.  As I noted in that statement, while US immigration policy is a matter for the US authorities, it is clear that the Executive Order signed by President Trump on 27 January last could have far-reaching implications, both on humanitarian grounds and for relations between the United States and the global Muslim community.  I would further note that the Government fully shares the concerns expressed by other EU partners regarding this development.  <\/p><p>Alongside these concerns, a question arose about the possible effects on dual nationals.  On 31 January 2017, the US authorities issued a clarification which was also publicised by the US Embassy in Dublin.  This noted that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  <\/p><p>That means that Irish citizens travelling to the United States on Irish passports should encounter no difficulties in this regard, as long as they have followed the relevant procedures governing the US Visa Waiver Programme and, if necessary, have obtained a US visa prior to travel.  <\/p><p>I wish to underline that Irish citizens, who are dual nationals of one of the seven states listed in the Executive Order signed on 27 January last, have the same rights to avail of the US Visa Waiver Programme as all other Irish citizens.  A total of 5,003 certificates of naturalisation were issued in the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016 to citizens of the seven states concerned.  Around 8,000 current Irish passport holders were born in one of these seven countries.<\/p><p>As the House will be aware, I travelled to the United States from 31 January to 2 February 2017, as part of a pre-planned visit to Washington, DC.  I had a number of meetings with several Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle &ndash; that is, both Republican and Democrat &ndash; including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Paul Ryan; House Majority Leader, Mr Kevin McCarthy; and House Minority Leader Ms. Nancy Pelosi.  <\/p><p>I also travelled to the White House where I met with representatives of the US Administration, including the Former US National Security Advisor &ndash; Gen. Michael Flynn.  During my meeting with Gen. Flynn I expressed the Government&rsquo;s deep concerns with regard to the nature and impact of the Executive Order of 27 January.  In response, Gen. Flynn outlined the rationale, in US immigration terms, for these temporary measures.  I also pointed out to Gen. Flynn the damaging consequences of these measures in humanitarian terms, as well as the impact on the international reputation of the United States.  I reiterated those views and concerns at my various meetings on Capitol Hill.<\/p><p>As the House will no doubt be aware, in recent days the US courts have intervened and imposed a temporary suspension on the implementation of the Executive Order of 27 January.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on a matter which is still the subject of legal proceedings.  <\/p><p><b><i>Pre-clearance at Dublin and Shannon Airports<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>In the context of discussions about the Executive Order in Ireland, the issue of Pre-Clearance facilities at both Dublin and Shannon Airports arose.  The matter was discussed at Cabinet and the Taoiseach has already requested that a review of preclearance be carried out.  This review &ndash; which is being chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport &ndash; involves officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I understand that this review is very close to completion.<\/p><p>However, I would like to clarify the facts regarding a number of questions that arose about Pre-Clearance facilities.  The US-Ireland Pre-clearance Agreement was signed by the Minister for Transport and the Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security on 17 November, 2008 and given effect in Irish law on 8 July, 2009 by the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009 (No. 16 of 2009).  <\/p><p>The US-Ireland Pre-clearance Agreement states that nothing therein diminishes the rights enjoyed by individuals under the Constitution and laws of Ireland or, where applicable, the United States of America.  It expressly states that the pre-clearance facility is within Irish jurisdiction and that the laws of Ireland apply at all times.  <\/p><p>US pre-clearance officers are not considered law enforcement officers.  The only law enforcement officers at Irish airports are members of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na and Customs Officers.  From an operational perspective, facilities are provided to the US Border and Customs staff to operate the facility and normal Garda assistance is available to passengers and US staff in these areas.  <\/p><p>Passengers who wish to avail of pre-clearance do so on condition that they recognise and consent to the right of the US to grant or refuse pre-clearance in accordance with its laws.  Passengers present voluntarily for pre-clearance and avail of the facility on a consensual basis.  Until their flights depart, passengers remain in Irish legal jurisdiction and have the right to withdraw from the pre-clearance process at any time.<\/p><p>If an individual is refused leave to board, they revert to the Garda immigration officer and are considered in the same manner as if they had presented at the frontier of the State seeking permission to enter.  Each case is examined on its individual merits, in accordance with Irish law.  The existence of pre-clearance facilities therefore has no effect on the capacity of persons to claim asylum in Ireland nor on the way that such individuals are treated.  <\/p><p>I would like to remind the House that pre-clearance of flights from Dublin or Shannon bound for destinations in the United States is not compulsory.  Air carriers choose to apply to have their services pre-cleared in either Dublin or Shannon.  <\/p><p>It is important to have clear factual information about Pre-Clearance in the public domain given its considerable benefits for Ireland.  Shannon Airport was the first airport in the world outside the Americas to offer a US pre-clearance facility.  Over 204,000 passengers used the pre-clearance facility at Shannon in 2016.  Pre-clearance is a major selling point with the airport&rsquo;s business and tourism customers, supporting trans-Atlantic connectivity for its catchment area along the entire Western-seaboard: from Donegal to Kerry and also serving the Midland counties.  <\/p><p>During 2016, almost 1.2 million passengers used the pre-clearance facility at Dublin Airport.  Dublin Airport has seen continuous growth in trans-Atlantic flights since the commencement of pre-clearance in 2011.  Pre-clearance has been a key driver of transfer growth at Dublin Airport.  Dublin Airport is the fifth busiest airport for connectivity to North America in Europe, behind Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Schiphol.  <\/p><p>The availability of pre-clearance facilities at both Dublin and Shannon Airports is a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s continued competitiveness in attracting US foreign direct investment, and Ireland&rsquo;s position as a gateway to the wider EU single market.  <\/p><p>It is worth noting in this context that the US is currently expanding the pre-clearance programme, with 10 airports short-listed as potential sites.  <\/p><p><b><i>Relations between Ireland and the United States<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>Ceann Comhairle, I might make a few remarks regarding the relationship between Ireland and the United States.  <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the long standing and warm relationship between Ireland and the US is protected in the interests of Irish citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.  Our relationship is complex and multi-layered, is based on shared values, as well as our deep political, historic and economic ties.<\/p><p>In economic terms alone over 150,000 people are directly employed in over 700 US firms in Ireland and that these account for over 74 % of all IDA supported employment.  In addition, Irish companies directly employ over 120,000 people in 227 companies at over 2,600 locations, in all 50 States across the USA.  US firms in Ireland form a critical part of Ireland&rsquo;s cutting edge, internationally traded goods and services economy in industries such as information &amp;amp; communications technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and financial services.  <\/p><p>As a government we have a responsibility to protect and advance the interests of our country and our people.  As the House will be aware, the Taoiseach was the first EU Head of State or Government to speak with then President-elect Trump immediately following his election on 8 November last.  The Taoiseach also spoke with then Vice-President-elect Pence &ndash; who has strong links with Ireland.  Separately, I spoke with Mr Paul Ryan, following his re-confirmation as Speaker of the House of Representatives.  <\/p><p>Following the US Presidential elections, there was some public debate about St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events, specifically in Washington DC.  Collectively, the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in Washington provide invaluable opportunities for the Government to discuss, at the very highest levels with the US Administration, our priorities and concerns.  It is also an opportunity to inform the new Administration and Congress of issues of Irish interest, including immigration reform and the Peace Process, and to reaffirm our longstanding relationship, based on shared values of democracy and the rule of law, as well as economic and historic ties.  <\/p><p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers the Government the opportunity &ndash; in a spirit of honest friendship &ndash; to raise our concerns with the United States&rsquo; Administration, as well as to honour the longstanding relationship between our two countries and peoples.  The tradition dates back several decades, and has facilitated contact with both Republican and Democrat Administrations.  It is a key date each year in our multi-faceted bilateral relations.  <\/p><p>President Trump, Vice-President Pence and Speaker Ryan have all indicated that they would wish to continue with the tradition of marking St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in Washington, DC.  <\/p><p>As I have already noted, I visited Washington, DC, from 31 January to 2 February last and met, among others, Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, as well as a large number of members of Congress and representatives of the Administration.  Our on-going engagement with US political leaders &ndash; from both sides of the aisle &ndash; is essential in advocating issues of interest or concern to the Irish people and I would like to publicly thank the Congressional Friends of Ireland for their commitment to our country.  <\/p><p>As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am acutely conscious of the challenges facing the undocumented Irish in the United States.  Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and agreement on a facility for future migration between Ireland and the US are longstanding Government objectives.  The undocumented Irish in the United States are believed to number around 50,000 individuals, spread across the US.  <\/p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has and will continue to seek practical, beneficial solutions to the plight of the undocumented Irish.  The Government will also continue to support organisations that deliver frontline advisory services and community care to Irish emigrants through the Emigrant Support Programme, which is overseen by Minister of State McHugh, Minister of State for the Diaspora.  <\/p><p>Many emigrants to the United States achieve great success but many others can find themselves in vulnerable circumstances.  More than 70% of the funds allocated through this programme are directed towards welfare services, including in support of the undocumented Irish in the U.S.  In the last funding round for the Emigrant Support Programme, my Department was able to allocate more than &euro; 2.3 million in funding to organisations in the United States.  I have visited Immigration Centres and I know that that funding makes a valuable contribution to vulnerable Irish citizens far from home and far from family networks.<\/p><p>During my recent short visit to Washington, DC, I had an opportunity to be fully briefed by our Ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Anne Anderson, and her colleagues at our Embassy on a range of issues of importance in our bilateral relations with the United States, including immigration reform.  Indeed, my officials regularly update me on this priority issue for the Irish government, which my colleague Minister McHugh and I, along with all of our government colleagues, are dedicated to progressing.<\/p><p>Our Embassy in Washington and Consulates across the United States remain in active and ongoing contact with Irish immigration centres throughout the U.S. Ambassador Anderson hosted a meeting of stakeholders in the area of immigration at the Embassy on 12 January last for an exchange of views on how progress might best made in the new political context, and to underline the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to those working with Irish immigrants in the United States.  <\/p><p>The bottom line is that it is only by continuing to engage with policy-makers in the US &ndash; both in the Administration and in Congress, as well as at State and local level &ndash; that we can articulate our concerns and seek to advance the interests of Irish citizens.  Whether it be with regard to the recent Executive Order or concerning the need for immigration reform.  As a Government we are determined to use every opportunity to set out our priorities on a broad range of issues, in the interests of our people, and of the values which both Ireland and the US share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100086#WRZ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diaspora Issues","counter":1538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100086#WRZ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1539,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[12974\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100086#WRZ01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps being taken in the diaspora policy to engage and support the Irish LGBT plus community abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1540,"content":"<p>&ldquo;<i>Global Irish<\/i>,&rdquo; Ireland&rsquo;s Diaspora policy, encompasses all Irish communities overseas.

It is akin to earlier legislation which used the same broad definitions to make Israelis who advocated the same opinions liable for financial damages.

Following an incident resulting in the deaths of at least 52 protesters, the Ethiopian Government declared a state of emergency on 9 October 2016.

I am aware that, since 2014, Bahrain has revoked the citizenship of over 250 people.

In order to meet this legal requirement, each person must, therefore, demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his\/her application.<\/p>  <p>  The applicants referred to were born in 2007 and 2008 respectively.  Their entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (the 1956 Act).  Section 6A provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four preceding his\/her birth.  Proofs of the lawful residence in the State are required to determine if a parent has the required three year residence.  For non-EU parents, permissions to remain in the State on passports, and\/or registration cards, as issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), are acceptable proofs of a parent&rsquo;s lawful residence in the context of a passport application.<\/p>  <p>  In this case, the applicants&rsquo; non-EU father submitted his passport and GNIB registration card with his children&rsquo;s passport applications.   These proofs show that his lawful residence dates from November 2013 to November 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Given that this period postdates his children&rsquo;s dates of birth, none of this residence can be reckoned for the purposes of Section 6A of the 1956 Act.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department is aware that applicant&rsquo;s father had earlier residence in the State.  However, this was authorised under permissions to remain in the State to study.  It should be noted that the 2004 amendment of the 1956 Act, excludes such periods of residence for the purposes of Section 6A. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of the above, the children&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated under Section 6A of the 1956 Act.  <\/p>  <p>  It would remain open to the father of the applicants to pursue his children&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship by way of naturalization.  To do this, he should contact the Department of Justice and Equality, who have responsibility for processing naturalization applications.  In the event that their applications are successful, the children would be issued with certificates of naturalization, which can serve as evidence of their Irish citizenship in any future passport application.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime a formal decision on these applications will be taken on the basis of the documentation submitted and the Passport Service will be in touch with the applicants shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100086#WRZ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":1577,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100086#WRZ04450"},{"type":"question","counter":1578,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[13973\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100086#WRZ04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the referendum taking place in Turkey in April 2017, which could give President Erdo\u011fan more powers; his further views on the future relationship with Turkey if the referendum passes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1579,"content":"<p>I have repeatedly raised my ongoing concerns about human rights, democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression in Turkey.  I am monitoring closely the Constitutional amendment package which was approved by the Turkish Grand Assembly on 21 January and which is now to be put to the people in a referendum scheduled to take place on 16 April.  If passed, the amendments will invest considerably more power in the office of President, and reduce the role of Parliament.   While the Head of State in many democracies has a strong executive function, the ongoing concerns at EU level and internationally about democracy and the rule of law in Turkey mean that there are serious considerations about the substance, timing and context of the constitutional proposals.  The assessment of the Venice Commission emphasises those concerns very directly in its assessment of the proposed amendments, and also expresses concerns that the referendum is not being conducted in line with democratic standards due to the restrictions in place as part of the on-going State of Emergency imposed on 20 July after the attempted coup. <\/p>  <p>  I would stress the EU statement of 13 March on the issue, which highlights concerns at the excessive concentration of powers in one office, with consequent effect on the necessary checks and balances in a democracy and on the independence of the judiciary.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service manages and maintains more than 485km of trails between National Parks, Nature Reserves and other conservation\/recreational properties. These are dispersed geographically across the country and attracted in excess of &euro;4 million visitors annually. Within the National Parks alone, the NPWS is responsible for a trail network spanning some 220km, including both cycling and walking trails, which run over some of the most iconic and scenic landscapes in Ireland.

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage. The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.<\/p><p>Under Section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its record of protected structures, a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure. Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the record of protected structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it. Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development. There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment. Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.<\/p><p>As Minister, and in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, I also have a role whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by a planning authority to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.

The proposed legislative changes are intended to encourage tourism and leisure craft users by supporting the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals and by enhancing Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s ability to manage, maintain and develop the canals as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Museum","counter":1709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1710,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[12968\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC00900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the process by which an association (details supplied) can have the Ardagh Chalice put on display in the village of Ardagh as part of its itinerary of commemorative events being planned for 2018 to mark the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the Ardagh Chalice in Ardagh, County Limerick; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1711,"content":"<p>The matter to which the Deputy refers is a day-to-day matter for the National Museum.<\/p><p>I understand that the National Museum of Ireland is working on plans for the anniversary of the discovery of the Ardagh Chalice in September 2018.

The Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies to support the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  The Plan was developed following an extensive consultation process with stakeholders to identify the key issues affecting rural communities today.  The Action Plan contains measures across a range of policy areas which will help to maintain and revitalise rural communities across the whole country. For instance, a key component of the Plan is to support the creation of jobs throughout the regions to ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally. The Plan aims to deliver 135,000 extra jobs outside of Dublin by 2020.<\/p>  <p>Our towns and villages are the heart of our rural communities, and it is important that we implement measures to help breath life back into these rural towns and villages. The rejuvenation of towns and villages will be supported under the Action Plan through schemes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the CL&Aacute;R Programme, both of which will be open to applications from counties Sligo and Leitrim.

I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council in Budget 2017. The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%, and will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025). <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I launched the Creative Ireland Programme &ndash; Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach 2017 &ndash; 2022 on the 8 December 2016. Funding of &euro;5m for the implementation of the programme was provided in Budget 2017. <\/p>  <p>  This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme. <\/p>  <p>  The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. The Creative Ireland Programme is the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in Culture 2025\/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, the draft cultural policy which I published last year and which sees a vibrant cultural ecosystem as essential to society. The programme is based on five pillars:<\/p>  <p>  -  Enabling the creative potential of every child<\/p>  <p>  -  Enabling creativity in every community<\/p>  <p>  -  Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure<\/p>  <p>  -  Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production<\/p>  <p>  -  Unifying our global reputation <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2nd Pillar Enabling creativity in every community - each local authority is being asked to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy for culture and creativity.  Each local authority has now established a Culture Team bringing together arts officers, librarians, heritage officers, museum curators, archivists and other relevant personnel led by a Director of Services, with a nominated person as 'Creative Ireland Co-ordinator'. <\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca&rsquo;, an annual programme of arts activities and cultural reflection to be held on Easter Monday, will be developed &ndash; across the island, locally, with our Diaspora, curated by the national broadcaster and delivered primarily by the local authorities. Beginning in 2018, there will also be an annual County of Culture award. The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will be a key partner in this pillar. <\/p>  <p>  I also recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country. The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces. Under the scheme the Hawk's Well Theatre, Sligo was awarded funding of &euro;550,000. The Dock, in partnership with Leitrim County Council, was awarded funding of over &euro;178,000 and North Leitrim Glens were awarded &euro;50,000. <\/p>  <p>  A full list of organisations to benefit from funding under Stream 1 and 2 of the Arts and Cultural Capital Scheme 2016-2018 is available on my Department's website.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I will be announcing a new small capital grants Scheme in the coming weeks which will be geared towards providing grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the increase in funding for the Arts Council, and for the Creative Ireland Programme, Budget 2017 also includes an additional &euro;1 mill ion to the Heritage Council.  I also secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 14% increase in its annual budget. My Department has commissioned an economic analysis of our screen based creative industries, in partnership with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. This study will examine the economic impact including employment and the potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector. The commissioning of the study is a commitment to in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 and its recommendations will inform the development of policy in this area under the Creative Ireland Programme. <\/p>  <p>  These kinds of investment are at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through Creative Ireland Programme and the Action Plan for Rural Development.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, which I launched with the Taoiseach in January, is the first whole-of-government strategy aimed at people living and working in rural Ireland. It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of supports at national and local level which will ensure that people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally, and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan is an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Government which will benefit rural Ireland. It takes a cohesive and coordinated approach across the whole of Government to the implementation of both economic and social policies that impact on rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan contains 276 actions which aim to improve both the economic and social fabric of rural Ireland spread across five pillars. Arts and Heritage are covered under the fourth pillar of the plan - Fostering Culture and Creativity in Rural Communities.  The key objectives of this Pillar are to:<\/p>  <p>  -  Increase access to the arts and enhance cultural facilities in rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  -  Further develop and enhance culture and creativity in rural Ireland through the establishment of culture teams and creativity hubs as part of the Creative Ireland Programme.<\/p>  <p>  -  Promote the Irish language as a key resource in Gaeltacht and other rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  These policy initiatives are supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector. <\/p>  <p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the arts and cultural area and has been welcomed across the sector. It reaffirms the commitment of this Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government and to ensure that all areas of the country benefit from the increased investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Heritage Plan","counter":1723,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1724,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[13099\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which various at-risk heritage sites and buildings within counties Sligo and Leitrim continue to be protected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":1725,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[13100\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she is engaged in the restoration of major historical or cultural sites in counties Sligo and Leitrim at present; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":1726,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[13104\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will make an audit of all historical buildings, including those of architectural and cultural interest, especially in regard to counties Sligo and Leitrim; the degree to which alterations have been made in the past ten years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":1727,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[13349\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the steps she is taking to preserve, support, maintain and promote heritage sites throughout counties Sligo and Leitrim and the country as a whole, with particular reference to the importance of ensuring that nothing is lost with regard to preservation for future generations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1728,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 653, 654, 658 and 667 together.<\/p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as are the roles of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners as regards heritage assets. <\/p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a State initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Arts, Heritage Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities. They are also a research and educational resource. <\/p>  <p>  The NIAH published surveys in 2007 for Sligo and in 2004 for Leitrim and issued ministerial recommendations to both councils for additions to their Record of Protected Structures. My Department has also published an introductory book to the built heritage of both counties. <\/p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage. The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its record of protected structures, a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure. Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the record of protected structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it. Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development. There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment. Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action. <\/p>  <p>  I also have a role, as Minister, in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by planning authorities to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites. As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014 of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument. Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW). Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care. <\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State. Anyone proposing works to a monument\u00a0that is\u00a0included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start. <\/p>  <p>  I launched a &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.\u00a0 This scheme operated in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014. The scheme provided funding for 278 projects nationally in 2016, including three projects in Leitrim and eight projects in Sligo. It is operating again this year and is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country in 2017 and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.\u00a0 This fund, administered through the local authorities, supported 57 projects nationally in 2016, including one project in Leitrim and three projects in Sligo. It seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.\u00a0 The scheme is operating again in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Receipt of applications for both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and Structures at Risk is now closed, however on-going queries can be addressed to all respective local authorities who are implementing both schemes throughout 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the broad range of measures in place across the various areas of our built heritage which I have outlined above which involve my Department, Local Government and the OPW I do not consider that a further audit is required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1729,"content":"<p>Question No. 655 answered with Question No. 652.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":1730,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1731,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[13102\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC03000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which local community-based festivals within counties Sligo and Leitrim have benefitted from EU grant aid, directly or indirectly, with particular reference to the specific grant aid for festivals; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1732,"content":"<p>The LEADER Programme provides a wide range of supports to local community groups for a broad range of activities.

The funding, which is being made available as part of the Capital Investment Framework 2016-2021, is dependent on matching funding being secured by project promoters and therefore provides an opportunity for philanthropists to involve themselves in the arts. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to know that, on December 8th last, the Taoiseach and I launched the Creative Ireland Programme\/Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach as the Government&rsquo;s Legacy Programme arising out of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme and as the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in Culture 2025. The Creative Ireland Programme is a high-level, high-ambition, all-of-Government initiative to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is now working to implement the Creative Ireland Programme with partners across Government and other key stakeholders. This includes delivery on an ambitious Year 1 Programme to deliver 10 initiatives by the end of 2017.  Details of the Programme can be found on www.creative.ireland.ie.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that this initiative will further stimulate private support for the arts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":1738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1739,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[13147\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the 2017 town and village renewal scheme will be announced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1740,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Rural Development, which was launched on 23<sup>rd<\/sup>January, contains a number of measures which have the objective of rejuvenating Ireland&rsquo;s rural towns and villages to make them more attractive places in which to live and work, and to increase their tourism potential.

This work incorporates a broad range of research, development and training in various sectors. Under my Department&rsquo;s Irish Language Support Schemes, funding continues to be provided for Irish language courses in third-level institutions in Ireland and overseas and for terminology initiatives which support the status of Irish as an official and working language of the European Union. Funding is also provided for various organisations which promote the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  As technology advances and its use becomes more commonplace within society generally, it is expected that the use of Irish language technology will become more prevalent. To this end, my Department is continuing to support the provision of Irish language resources online and via the development of apps. In addition, funding is allocated to assist youth organisations and schools through the TechSpace as Gaeilge initiative to purchase digital media equipment. This new project was launched in 2015 and is aimed at young Irish language speakers interested in developing their digital media skills. TechSpace is a national network which helps young people to create digital and technological material as they engage in activities such as digital film, web design, mobile app development and robotics, among others. Techspace as Gaeilge was piloted in Connacht and it is currently being rolled out in the Munster region. It is proposed to roll out TechSpace as Gaeilge nationally, on phased basis over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  Also funded by my Department is the development by Fiontar, Dublin City University, of a database of EU terminology in the Irish language, an online database of place names and a joint project between the Department, UCD and DCU to digitise the Schools&rsquo; Collection of National Folklore Collection. Funding is also being provided to Trinity College Dublin for the development of the Irish language synthesiser project, abair.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Funding in the region of &euro;1m annually is provided through the Advanced Irish language Skills Initiative for a range of specialised third-level Irish language courses such as translation, interpretation, and law for the provision of suitably qualified persons to meet recruitment needs in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0total of &euro;7.812m has been provided to my Department in 2017 for the promotion and maintenance of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. This allocation consists of &euro;1.422m in capital expenditure for the construction and refurbishment of language based facilities and the upgrade of summer colleges. The current funding allocation of &euro;6.390m covers various language-centred programmes and schemes such as the Irish Language Summer Colleges, summer camps, language assistants in schools and other cultural activities directed primarily towards children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  The work of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is, of course, also vital in our efforts to maintain the Irish language as the community language of the Gaeltacht. An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s currently supports the creation of in the region of 500 Gaeltacht-based jobs annually and also funds community development structures, the Irish language arts and pre-school education in Gaeltacht areas. <\/p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing in respect of the language planning process provided for in the Gaeltacht Act 2012. At present, 26 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas have been recognised for the purposes of the Act.\u00a0 Under the Act, Gaeltacht Service Towns are defined as those towns situated in or adjacent to Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas and which have a significant role in providing public services and recreational, social and commercial facilities for those areas. Late in 2016, notices were published under the Act in respect of Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, Co. Kerry, Letterkenny, Co. Donegal, and Galway City. This effectively starts the process to prepare and implement language plans for these Gaeltacht Service Towns. Foras na Gaeilge is responsible under the Act for supporting organisations with regard to the preparation and implementation of language plans in Irish Language Networks, those areas outside the Gaeltacht which have achieved a basic critical mass of community and State support for the Irish language. Foras na Gaeilge has selected Loughrea, Co. Galway, Ennis, Co. Clare, and Clondalkin, Dublin as Irish Language Networks and the process to prepare language plans in respect of these networks has now begun. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department provides co-funding, in co-operation with the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, to Foras na Gaeilge to carry out its legislative mandate to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis. In that context, Foras na Gaeilge supports a wide range of initiatives which promote the use of Irish in everyday life. Foras supports the work of six lead organisations which focus on key strategic areas such as education, raising language awareness and creating opportunities to use the language, in addition to community and economic development. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be interested to learn that my Department recently held a Brexit consultation event with its stakeholders, which included Foras na Gaeilge, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Conradh na Gaeilge, for the purpose of gaining an insight into the difficulties these organisations potentially face as a result of Brexit. This exercise proved particularly fruitful, given the high level of engagement by all parties, and the insights gained by my Department will assist it in minimising the impact of Brexit on its stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Further information about the work of the Department and organisations under its remit is available on its website at: www.ahrrga.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":1744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1745,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[13268\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100089#WRCC04400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to re-establish the all-party consultation group on the decade of commemorations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1746,"content":"<p>The Government will continue to mark significant events throughout the Decade of Centenaries based on the inclusive, open and consultative approach that has worked so well for last year&rsquo;s 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.<\/p>  <p>  There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.

The closing date for local authorities to receive applications from members of the public was 28 February 2017.

The local authorities, acting on behalf of Irish Water, act as agents for the HSE in providing, installing and maintaining equipment for fluoridation and in adding the fluoride to water and testing the fluoride content of water to which fluoride has been added. <\/p>  <p>  Water fluoridation is the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries (tooth decay). Many countries have water fluoridation schemes, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. Water fluoridation is less common in Europe.   However, fluoride is an essential part of oral health policy in all countries in Europe. This can mean fluoridation of salt or provision of community fluoridation through other means.<\/p>  <p>  Water fluoridation  is a key element of public health policy in Ireland in the prevention and management of tooth decay. <\/p>  <p>  A research project \"Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth\" (FACCT) is being conducted by UCC and supported by the HSE. Preliminary results indicate that children's oral health has been improving overall since the previous survey of children's oral health in 2002. Fluoridated communities continue to have lower levels of tooth decay than non-fluoridated communities. The results of this research project are due to be published this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population was conducted by the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department. This review was published by the HRB in June 2015. The HRB has found no evidence that community water fluoridation is associated with negative health effects.      <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health was established in 2004, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Forum on Fluoridation Report. The Body monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, is a safe and effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. <\/p>  <p>  Now that the Forum recommendations have been implemented, I have decided to appoint a new Expert Body on Fluorides and Health with new Terms of Reference. Expressions of interest will be sought in the near future. The Body will have a key role in advising me on all issues relating to the fluoridation of public water supplies and its impact on other aspects of policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors Remuneration","counter":1839,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1840,"qnumday":699,"qnumall":"[12790\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total cost of the deal reached between the Health Service Executive and the Irish Medical Organisation for the restoration of the living out allowance for non-consultant doctors; the source from which this money will be allocated; if he or the HSE consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1841,"content":"<p>The Living Out Allowance was abolished for new entrant non-consultant hospital doctors (Intern, Senior House Officer and Registrar grades) in 2012.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria. <\/p><p>1. The health needs of the public.<\/p><p>2. The cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services.<\/p><p>3. The availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement. <\/p><p>4. The proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks.<\/p><p>5. The potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item.<\/p><p>6. The clinical need for the item or listed item.<\/p><p>7. The appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety.<\/p><p>8. The efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it eats a condition than existing therapies). <\/p><p>9. The resources available to the HSE. <\/p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza, for reimbursement of maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.<\/p><p>In June last year, the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment. The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016. The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.<\/p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement, which is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by the HSE Drugs Group, which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.<\/p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process, the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company. The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 day period (from the formal written notice of proposal), to enable the company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so. The HSE is required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.<\/p><p>Therefore, as the statutory process is still ongoing, the company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE. <\/p><p>In relation to the access scheme, the operation of such schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers. As Minister for Health I have no role in the operation of these schemes. There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need. <\/p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access, for patients already being treated with a new medicine, with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical. Manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially motivated manner. There should be no link between compassionate use schemes and reimbursement decisions and manufacturers should be open with patients and clinicians from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE10000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services Provision","counter":1919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE10100"},{"type":"question","counter":1920,"qnumday":720,"qnumall":"[12881\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE10200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the new emergency department will open with regard to University Hospital Limerick; his plans for the recruitment of staff for this unit; the number of staff that will be employed in this unit.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1921,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE10300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":1922,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE10400"},{"type":"question","counter":1923,"qnumday":721,"qnumall":"[12884\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE10500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a decision will be made on whether to add the free style libre flash glucose monitoring system to the reimbursement list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1924,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100091#WREE10600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1926,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100092#WRFF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1927,"qnumday":722,"qnumall":"[12885\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100092#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a medical card ceased in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1928,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

A number of important steps have been taken in recent years to strengthen the protection afforded to vulnerable children and adults in the State's day care and residential care settings.  Some of these measures, such as the establishment in early 2014 of  the Child and Family Agency, TUSLA, for example, are outside the remit of my Department.  <\/p><p>Within the health sector specifically, the Health Service Executive published its national safeguarding policy and procedures, <i>Safeguarding Vulnerable People at Risk of Abuse,<\/i>in December 2014.  This safeguarding policy was the first such HSE policy to encompass both elder abuse and concerns of abuse relating to people availing of disability services.  <\/p><p>Following on from this policy, a National Safeguarding Committee was formally established in December 2015 with multi-agency and inter-sectoral representation.  The Committee is independently chaired by Ms. Patricia T. Rickard-Clarke.  It has agreed Terms of Reference but its overarching remit is to support the development of a societal and organisational culture, which promotes the rights of persons who may be vulnerable and safeguards them from abuse.  Its remit extends beyond abuse of elderly and disabled persons and recognises that any vulnerable adult can be subject to abuse.  Vulnerability can be a transient or permanent state depending on many influences.  The Safeguarding Committee published its Strategic Plan for 2017 &ndash; 2021 on 20 December 2016.  One of its strategic objectives is the initiation of conversations with Government and Oireachtas Committees on the development of legislation on adult safeguarding.  The work to date of the National Safeguarding Committee has confirmed that the scope of the issues around the safeguarding of vulnerable adults goes far beyond the area of health and that a much broader, cross-sectoral approach is needed. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Act 2007 provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), its inspection and regulation of designated centres and the framework for registration of these designated centres.  &ldquo;Designated centre&rdquo; is the term used in the Health Act 2007 to describe residential centres for (i) people with disabilities, (ii) older people, and (iii) children. <\/p><p>HIQA commenced regulation of residential services for people with disabilities on 1 November 2013.  The purpose of regulation is to safeguard and support the delivery of person-centred care to vulnerable people of any age who are receiving residential care services and to ensure that their health, well-being and quality of life is promoted and protected.  There are some 1000 residential centres throughout the country for people with disabilities, of which over 750 have been registered to date by HIQA.  HIQA has carried out over 2,700 inspections since regulation began in 2014. By the end of April 2016, every centre for people with disabilities in the country had been inspected at least once, with many being inspected multiple times.  The lessons learned from these inspections are continuing to improve the quality of services.<\/p><p>Compliance with HIQA standards for disability residential centres is a requirement under the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and voluntary service providers.  Arising from concerns raised by HIQA in relation to the standards of residential care in some settings, the HSE is currently implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures targeted on improving the quality of residential services for people with disabilities.  In addition to implementing its <i>National Policy and Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse,<\/i>these measures include: <\/p><p>- A National Implementation Task Force;<\/p><p>- Implementation of an Evaluation and Quality Improvement Programme in disability residential centres;<\/p><p>- Developing a National Volunteer Advocacy Programme in adult disability residential settings; and <\/p><p>- An Assurance Review (McCoy Review) of all the Units in the &Aacute;ras Attracta facility.<\/p><p>An independent person, Ms. Leigh Gath, has been appointed as Confidential Recipient, to receive concerns of abuse, negligence, mistreatment or poor care practices in the HSE or HSE funded services from patients, service users, families or other concerned individuals and staff.  <\/p><p>The HSE is also establishing a National Independent Review Panel with an independent chair and Review Team for disability services.  The Review Panel will focus on serious incidents that occur in disability services across the HSE and HSE funded services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100093#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1960,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100093#WRGG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1961,"qnumday":750,"qnumall":"[12938\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100093#WRGG01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite surgery for a person (details supplied) at University Hospital Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1962,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This disease is included in the undergraduate and postgraduate medical training curricula.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, screening for coeliac disease is not routinely carried out. The blood test required is reasonably, but not completely, accurate. This means that routinely screening the entire population could produce a high number of false-positive results. In other words, people would be misdiagnosed as having coeliac disease when they did not have it. Therefore, screening for coeliac disease is usually only recommended for people who are experiencing symptoms of the condition or those with known risk factors for the condition, such as having a family history of the disease.<\/p>  <p>  Those who are offered serological testing for coeliac disease should include first degree relatives of people with coeliac disease. A positive blood test result may give an indication of coeliac disease, but definitive diagnosis requires an endoscopic examination to obtain a biopsy of the small bowel.

Schools then take whatever measures they feel are necessary to cater for the specific needs of the enrolled student, and this can include seeking additional resources where a student&rsquo;s condition requires additional support e.g. physical or learning needs. Children with Coeliac disease would not generally require such extra supports, such as a special needs assistant.<\/p>  <p>  The SPHE syllabus in primary school, particularly in fifth and sixth classes, asks teachers and students to &lsquo;explore and examine&rsquo; some of the illnesses particularly associated with food intake or special health conditions: coeliac, diabetic, anorexia, bulimia, the dietary needs of different age groups and individuals.<\/p>  <p>  In post-primary schools, both the existing SPHE syllabus and new SPHE short course emphasise the importance of diet and nutrition to health. They do not insist on coverage of particular conditions and how to approach them, leaving schools the flexibility to look at topics which may be particularly relevant to their students. Given the range of possible conditions and allergies that a large post primary school could have among its student cohort, the emphasis is on promoting holistic understanding of diet and diet-related conditions, while teacher guidelines also focus on broader issues e.g. school canteen food. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to stress that the optional subject Home Economics can play a significant part in raising awareness of diet and diet-related conditions, at both junior and senior cycles in post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, it is expected that parents will provide schools with the appropriate information on their child&rsquo;s condition, allergy or illness, and this can and ought to include any specific advice that teachers need to have in order to support the child. It is equally important to remember that teachers, or other students, are not medics and cannot take the place of qualified medical personnel e.g. administering medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100094#WRHH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":2062,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100094#WRHH04900"},{"type":"question","counter":2063,"qnumday":787,"qnumall":"[13072\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100094#WRHH05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to review funding or the appropriateness of managing funding for persons with coeliac disease within the disability section of a service rather than a more relevant area such as health and well-being (details supplied).","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2064,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100094#WRHH05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":2065,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100094#WRHH05200"},{"type":"question","counter":2066,"qnumday":788,"qnumall":"[13073\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100094#WRHH05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total saving achieved per annum by removing the cost of gluten free products from medical cards since the cut was introduced in 2012; and his plans to review this policy.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2067,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.

The Health Research Board study reported that 85% of respondents believe that the current level of alcohol consumption in Ireland is too high, with 73% believing that Irish society tolerates high-levels of alcohol consumption.   <\/p>  <p>  Recent findings suggest that the majority of Irish drinkers engage in excessive or problematic drinking behaviours and that Irish drinkers underestimate their alcohol intake.  Ireland&rsquo;s alcohol consumption remains in the top 5 among EU28 Member States.  Ireland came fourth among 36 OECD countries for alcohol consumption, after Estonia, Austria and France.  Ireland was second in the WHO European Region (which has the highest consumption in the world) in relation to binge drinking with 39% of the population misusing alcohol in this manner at least monthly.  This statistic was confirmed by national research through the Healthy Ireland survey, which found that drinking to excess on a regular basis is commonplace throughout the population with almost 4 in 10 (39%) of drinkers binge drinking on a typical drinking occasion and a quarter of them doing so at least once a week.  Provisional figures released from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners indicate that our alcohol consumption levels increased in 2016 to 11.46 litres per capita.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential to have a public health policy response which seeks to reduce the number of people engaged in the harmful use of alcohol.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill contains a package of measures aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres (the OECD average in 2012) per person per annum by 2020, and to reduce the harms associated with alcohol.  The Bill includes provisions for:<\/p>  <p>  - minimum unit pricing; <\/p>  <p>  - health labelling of alcohol products; <\/p>  <p>  - the regulation of advertising and marketing of alcohol; <\/p>  <p>  - the regulation of sponsorship; <\/p>  <p>  - separation of alcohol products in mixed trading retail outlets; and<\/p>  <p>  - the regulation of the sale and supply of alcohol in certain circumstances<\/p>  <p>  The Bill along with other measures will bring about a cultural shift in how we view and consume alcohol.  As a consequence we will see an improvement in both physical and mental health and wellbeing in the population.  The Bill commenced Committee Stage in the Seanad on 26 October 2016, and will resume during this session of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100096#WRKK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1339"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Data","counter":2155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100096#WRKK00700"},{"type":"question","counter":2156,"qnumday":818,"qnumall":"[13257\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100096#WRKK00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of general practitioners in the Ballybrack and Shankill area that have a GMS list and are still accepting new patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2157,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to  the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100096#WRKK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Beds Data","counter":2158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100096#WRKK01000"},{"type":"question","counter":2159,"qnumday":819,"qnumall":"[13265\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100096#WRKK01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of hospital beds per 1,000 of the population; if there is data relating to these figures in a comparable context in respect of other OECD countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2160,"content":"<p>As of December, 2016, the Health Service Executive (HSE) data indicate that acute hospital bed capacity numbered 12,644 beds, comprised of 10,507 inpatient and 2,137 day case beds.

It should be noted that the international definitions of hospital beds do not include day beds.<\/p>  <p>  The Private Hospitals Association estimate the current aggregate bed capacity of their member hospitals at approximately 2,500 beds. Inclusion of private capacity would hypothetically give a figure of approximately 3.2 hospital beds per 1,000 population (a total of just over 15,200), based on the population of approximately 4.76 million recorded by the 2016 Census. The OECD average (based on 2013 figures) is 4.8 hospital beds per 1000 population.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that our population is younger than those of European nations with high hospital bed numbers, although numbers of over 65s are increasing at the rate of almost 20,000 per year.

The main objective of the Regulation is to ensure that patients suffering from rare conditions have the same quality of treatment as any other patient in the EU, where previously research on such conditions and development of treatments was not considered to be economically viable.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulation lays down a procedure for the designation of &lsquo;orphan status&rsquo; and provides incentives for research and development of such products and placing them on the market.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has designated 1825 products in development as orphan medicinal products.  Those companies responsible for these orphan medicines can benefit from incentives such as protocol assistance- scientific advice to facilitate the development and authorisation of innovative medicines; 10 years of market exclusivity - where similar medicines for the same condition cannot be placed on the market; and fee waivers for regulatory procedures may also be available.<\/p>  <p>  The number of products available to treat rare diseases remains low but has grown significantly over the years.  An assessment of the impact of the European Union's orphan drug regulation 10 years after it was enacted, concluded that it had boosted research and led to the increased availability of drugs to treat rare diseases.  To date, the European Commission has authorised 136 orphan medicines for the benefit of patients suffering from rare diseases, whereas before the adoption of the Regulation there were only 8 treatments marketed for rare conditions.  The incentives of the orphan drug legislation are therefore essential to facilitate the development of treatments for rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2016 the Commission published new guidance on how specific provisions of the Regulation should be applied.  This guidance provides procedures and legal predictability for pharmaceutical companies on a number of aspects of the Regulation, including when more than one application for a marketing authorisation for an orphan medicinal product is received for the same condition; and clarity over determinations of significant benefit over existing treatments and similar medicinal products for the same condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100098#WRMM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescriptions Charges","counter":2290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100098#WRMM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2291,"qnumday":872,"qnumall":"[13432\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100098#WRMM03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of abolishing prescription charges; the estimated cost of lowering the drug payment scheme threshold in &euro;20 intervals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2292,"content":"<p>I am informed by the HSE that the estimated full year cost of abolishing prescription charges is &euro;120m.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the person claiming the allowance's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 was published Thursday 2nd March 2017.  This Bill will enable the granting of full eligibility for general practitioner and other health services to all children in respect of whom a Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is paid, which, in turn, may benefit those children with Prader- Willi Syndrome.  Any child with Prader-Willi Syndrome, whose Guardian is in receipt of a DCA payment for them, will be eligible for a medical card upon enactment of the legislation.  It is expected that this will be in place for 1st June 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100098#WRMM07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2333,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 886 and 887 answered with Question No. 882.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2335,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100099#WRNN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2336,"qnumday":888,"qnumall":"[13481\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100099#WRNN00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2337,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The purpose of this project is to improve survival rates for those who suffer an out of hospital cardiac arrest through the development and implementation of an out of hospital cardiac arrest strategy.

It demonstrated how the NAS and CFR Ireland intend to consolidate, enhance and implement further CFR schemes over the next five years through a National Community First Responder Framework.  Its ambitions over the next few years include increasing the availability of training in CPR in schools, work places and local groups and making Public Access Defibrillators more easily accessible with people knowing how to use them.  It also aims to:<\/p>  <p>  - Work in partnership with all relevant organisations (statutory, voluntary, community and private sectors) to increase the availability of Public Access Defibrillators<\/p>  <p>  - Put in place effective arrangements to ensure that Public Access Defibrillators are mapped, maintained and accessible to the public<\/p>  <p>  - Commence a public awareness campaign to increase the level of provision of CFR Schemes in geographical areas of priority.<\/p>  <p>  And so one of the means to help improve outcomes in this area is CFR groups.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.<\/p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups. CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  Both the NAS and CFR Ireland currently support over 145 Community First Responder schemes throughout Ireland, who train community members to provide emergency care support.<\/p>  <p>  If an emergency 999\/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.

Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Medical card provision is solely based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100100#WROO04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":2469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100100#WROO04550"},{"type":"question","counter":2470,"qnumday":932,"qnumall":"[13741\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100100#WROO04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will have surgery arranged.","asker":"1268","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2471,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; <\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board;<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service.<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home. <\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, e.g. social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100101#WRPP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":2505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100101#WRPP01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2506,"qnumday":945,"qnumall":"[13792\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100101#WRPP01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which a person (details supplied) in County Sligo has access to a medical card to cover costs associated with treatments prior to March 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2507,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

It is intended that families and service users will be notified by the end of May of the placements which will be made available to them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100101#WRPP04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":2540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100102#WRQQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2541,"qnumday":957,"qnumall":"[13834\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100102#WRQQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the Susie Long project planned for St Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; if the HSE plans to provide funding for the project; the section within the HSE that is tasked with the delivery of the project; if he has a timeframe in place within which the project will be delivered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2542,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100102#WRQQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100102#WRQQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2544,"qnumday":958,"qnumall":"[13837\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100102#WRQQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if angiogram services will be provided at St Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, in view of the number of persons from the area who must travel to Dublin for the service and the poor public transport system available to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2545,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100102#WRQQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2547,"qnumday":959,"qnumall":"[13838\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100102#WRQQ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current status on the provision for a second cath lab at WUH; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2548,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that, in his review of cath lab services in University Hospital Waterford (UHW), Dr Niall Herity concluded that the needs of the effective UHW catchment population could be accommodated from a single cath lab.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.  In order to apply for the Scheme, an applicant must be ordinarily resident in the State (i.e. living in the State for at least a year or intending to live in the State for at least a year).  The Scheme does not cover transportation costs.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; <\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>A care needs assessment is carried out to identify whether or not an applicant needs long-term nursing home care.  If long-term care is indeed required, a financial assessment is then carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.<\/p><p>The nursing home loan (Ancillary State Support) is an optional benefit of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  Where a person&rsquo;s assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets (7.5% of the value of such assets per annum) may be deferred.  The loan can be repaid at any time but will ultimately fall due for repayment upon the applicant&rsquo;s death. <\/p><p>The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:<\/p><p>- Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<\/p><p>- An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his\/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;<\/p><p>- If an applicant has a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p><p>- If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p><p>- Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;<\/p><p>- A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.<\/p><p>I note that the Deputy has indicated that the individual in question is dependent on social welfare.  The applicant or his family can obtain further information on the supports available through the Scheme, including a list of public, private and voluntary nursing homes in Ireland, from Nursing Homes Support Offices located throughout the country.

Policy in the agricultural sector is formed around \"an approach to carbon neutrality\" which addresses both sequestration and emissions mitigation.  Methane accounts for approximately 22% of Ireland's GHG emissions.<\/p>  <p>  Current research into reducing methane emissions is primarily focussed on reducing emissions per unit product (ie. reducing emissions intensity).  This research is primarily focused on improving productivity per animal and thus decoupling animal numbers from production.  Most of this research is focussed on developing economic breeding indices (EBI), extension of the grazing season, reducing beef finishing times (and reducing total methane per animal) and optimising beef and dairy animals via the use of sexed semen.  Many of these measures are currently in use or being commenced. <\/p>  <p>  Carbon audits by our Food Agency (An Bord Bia) are placing new emphasis on reduction in emissions intensity of beef and dairy produce. <\/p>  <p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland can take the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, in the Irish agriculture sector.  In the Rural Development Programme, there are some 38,000 farmers taking part in the Green Low carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) and 24,000 herds are in the Beef Data Genomics Programme, which is a world-leading initiative to improve the quality of breeding of our beef cattle. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, a National Mitigation Plan is being prepared.  This work\u00a0is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council.\u00a0 These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and Senior\u00a0Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and\u00a0a Domestic Climate Finance Group.<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 &ndash; the strategic plan for the sustainable development of agri-food sector over the next decade - provides a framework for the agri sector to engage with the National Mitigation Plan. Food Wise builds on its predecessor and focuses on the continued growth in the value of Irish agri-food including dairy production.  While this is likely to mean some increase in dairy numbers, it is not expected that there will be a significant increase in overall cattle numbers. <\/p>  <p>  There is a strong commitment in Food Wise 2025 to measure and monitor the sustainability credentials of the sector.  As part of the implementation of Food Wise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established.  This implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to invest in and engage with research initiatives to further assist with the refinement, development and deployment of new and innovative practices to reduce Green House Gases that are associated with agricultural production. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":2690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2691,"qnumday":1011,"qnumall":"[14264\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if Ireland will be represented at the global symposium on soil organic carbon being held in Rome under the auspices of the FAO (details supplied).","asker":"1294","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2692,"content":"<p>My Department recognises the importance of soil carbon and its contribution to the global challenge set by the Paris agreement to limit warming to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels and to pursue limiting warming to less than 1.5 degrees.

The Bill itself does not apply the specific conditions.  Therefore, other parallel associated measures will be required to ensure that conditions in place for Irish sea-fishing boats are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland boats fishing under the\u00a0Voisinage\u00a0arrangements.  The process of identifying which conditions may need to be legislated for is under way.  The conditions will include such restrictions as currently apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  When the necessary measures have been identified, the most appropriate mechanisms for applying them to Northern Ireland boats will be determined.  The objective will be for these measures to come into effect at the same time as commencement order for the Bill.  Together, the Bill and the associated measures will re-establish the\u00a0status quo\u00a0for fishing access that existed under the\u00a0Voisinage\u00a0arrangements before the Supreme Court's judgment on 27 October.  The only difference will be that the\u00a0Voisinage\u00a0arrangements will be provided for within a legislative framework.  The access arrangements for Northern Ireland boats will not change as a result of this Bill, Northern Ireland boats will simply regain fishing access they have had for decades under the\u00a0Voisinage arrangements in the zero to six nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State.  They will also continue to be subject to the same measures that apply to Irish-registered fishing boats.<\/p>  <p>  Fishing industry representatives have been briefed on the Bill and the associated measures at recent meetings with my Department. \u00a0The purpose of the Bill is not to change long-standing fishing access arrangements but to take account of the Court&rsquo;s judgment and provide for arrangements that existed prior to 27 October 2016 to be reinstated within a legislative framework. \u00a0Access continues to be accommodated for Irish sea-fishing boats to fish within the Northern Ireland 0 to 6 nautical mile zone.  The Bill will fulfill Ireland&rsquo;s obligations and give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Installation Aid Scheme Applications","counter":2714,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2715,"qnumday":1019,"qnumall":"[12929\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of persons under 40 years of age with a green certificate that started farming between 2000 and 2008 and did not draw installation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2716,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not available. <\/p><p>The\u00a0Installation\u00a0Aid Scheme was provided\u00a0for under the 2000-2006 National Development Plan and the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme was introduced under the 2007-2013 Rural\u00a0Development Programme. <\/p><p>The Installation Aid\u00a0Scheme provided a grant to\u00a0farmers under 35 setting up in farming for the first time on or before 31 December 2006 provided they met the income and educational requirements of the Scheme.

Irish dairy farmers will receive approximately &euro;6.5 million from this fund by the end of March 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":2733,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS06600"},{"type":"question","counter":2734,"qnumday":1026,"qnumall":"[12965\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100104#WRSS06700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the figures highlighted in a presentation by an organisation (details supplied) with respect to Ireland's percentage area of EU waters and the percentage of fish caught and landed in Irish waters pre and post Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2735,"content":"<p>It is important to note that borders and maritime delineations are in the first instance a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs \u00a0and Trade.\u00a0 However, I can provide you with our working figures for the purposes of preparing our analyses of the potential implications of Brexit for the Irish fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  Our figures show that the total EU Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (200\u00a0 miles) \u00a0is \u00a07,044,000 square kilometres.\u00a0 The Irish EEZ is 438,000 square kilometres, this amounts to 6.22% of the EU EEZ.\u00a0 The UK EEZ is 747,000 square kilometres, which is 10.6% of the EU EEZ.\u00a0 Once the UK leaves the EU, the total EU EEZ will be reduced to 6,297,000 square kilometres.\u00a0 The Irish share will then be 6.96% of the total EU EEZ.<\/p>  <p>  EU landings from the Irish Zone account for 13% of the total EU landings from EU waters by volume and 13% by value.

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  This Scheme is significant in this regard, providing farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, which will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.  The Scheme is administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank and they will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis, although no official returns have been made as yet.  However all of the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme.

During that outbreak we were entirely dependent on the Pirbright Laboratory in the UK for laboratory diagnosis of suspect cases of disease. In addition, following on from &ldquo;9\/11&rdquo; and more stringent regulations on air transport of dangerous goods, it became increasingly difficult to send samples from suspect cases to the UK. It therefore became essential to develop national capability in exotic viral disease diagnosis and to ensure we had a facility within which exotic viruses could be safely handled. The original specification for this containment laboratory was based on the UK Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) standard of that time. <\/p>  <p>  In 2007, while officials in my Department and the Office of Public Works (OPW) were attempting to resolve some outstanding issues on the original Laboratory project, there was yet another FMD outbreak in the UK in 2007. This outbreak\u00a0prompted an international revision of bio-containment standards for laboratories handling the virus. In Ireland this incident emphasised both the need to develop our own testing capability and the critical importance attaching to bio-containment standards. <\/p>  <p>  It was therefore decided to progress amelioration works on the high containment laboratory suite at Backweston so that it could be operated at the highest international standard attainable (the Australia-New Zealand standard) rather than the MAFF standard which was now considered dated.<\/p>  <p>  OPW is currently in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office on pursuing the original contractor in respect of\u00a0 an underlying issue in the fabric of the original building uncovered during the current work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100106#WRUU04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":2871,"qnumday":1072,"qnumall":"[13708\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100106#WRUU04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there are other expenditures involved in the redesign, build and commissioning of the high containment laboratory at the Backweston facility in County Kildare that have not been provided.","asker":"1344","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2872,"content":"<p>My Department, in collaboration with the Office of Public Works, is currently developing a high containment laboratory at Backweston to enhance our National capability in the laboratory diagnosis of exotic viral diseases of farmed animals.<\/p>  <p>  It was decided to undertake amelioration works on a pre-existing laboratory space to achieve the highest attainable international standard of bio-containment &ndash; the Australia-New Zealand BSL4 standard. This decision followed an outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease in the UK in 2007 which was associated with the escape of virus from the Pirbright laboratory facility. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, to address potential risk and have confidence that a building project would deliver a facility to the required certified standard the following steps were taken:- A US engineering firm (which specialises in building and retrofitting containment laboratories) was retained on contract to oversee the design, build and commissioning of the laboratory; their proposed building solution was implemented and tested in one part of the laboratory and\u00a0the heat treatment and drainage system was redesigned. The total cost of this preparatory work was &euro;954,080.<\/p>  <p>  The tendered cost of the main building works was &euro;4.9 million excluding VAT. However additional costs of &euro;1.07m (broken down below)\u00a0have accrued due to variations to the building contract as a result of specification or working method changes, or due to unforeseen circumstances. During the construction works an underlying issue in the fabric of the original building was discovered &ndash; this did not affect the stability of the structure but had the potential to compromise containment and required an engineering solution and was associated with project delays which cost &euro;219,572. This is a highly specialised project, the first of its kind undertaken in Ireland, such that it was inevitable that some changes would be made during the building phase to ensure the required level of containment and building efficiency - these variations to bolster air-tightness and security\u00a0and enhance\u00a0integration with building controls amounted to &euro;853,790 (ex. VAT).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100106#WRUU04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":2873,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100106#WRUU04350"},{"type":"question","counter":2874,"qnumday":1073,"qnumall":"[13710\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100106#WRUU04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an agri-environment options scheme payment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2875,"content":"<p>The person named commenced their AEOS 2 contract on 1st September\u00a02011.

In 2011 my Department officials met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar and bioethanol production\u00a0facility, using sugar beet,\u00a0in this country. The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicate that the overall capital\u00a0costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. <\/p>  <p>  My Department officials have\u00a0informed both groups\u00a0that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a\u00a0sufficiently robust business case\u00a0in order\u00a0to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required. My Government colleague Minister Coveney informed both groups at the time that it was his job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date. In this connection, he secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the final EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which he chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017. This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member State, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. <\/p>  <p>  The current\u00a0Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;.

The legislation provides for the repeal of the current price cap mechanism which will enable An Post to implement the proposed price increases.<\/p>  <p>  The mails business is undergoing a profound structural change both here and internationally.  Electronic substitution has had a significant impact on the letters business.  This development is particularly apparent in terms of large volume postal customers such as banks and utility providers.  The trend which has been evident for some years accelerated in 2016 resulting in a serious financial impact for An Post.  It should be noted that internationally the mails and post office businesses are experiencing long term structural challenges so this is not just an issue facing An Post.<\/p>  <p>  One of the main elements of the postal service here in Ireland is the daily delivery of post to every address in the State.  I am extremely cognisant of the value placed on this service by communities in both rural and urban areas and recognise the importance of ensuring that An Post has the capacity to continue to fulfil its obligations in this area.  The introduction of legislation to effectively enable An Post to increase the price of the stamp was considered the most viable option for supporting An Post in the short term while a restructuring plan is developed and implemented.\u00a0 This is not a decision that was taken lightly.  NewERA has conducted an in-depth review of the company in recent months on behalf of the shareholding Ministers and has confirmed the seriousness of the situation facing the company.<\/p>  <p>  I too was concerned that this legislation would have the effect of accelerating the decline in mail volume and it is an issue I raised directly with An Post when the Bill was being drafted.  Having evaluated the situation, An Post is satisfied\u00a0pricing represents the best approach\u00a0to secure the financial viability pending consideration of restructuring options.\u00a0 While volume decline is a feature of the postal markets both here and internationally, it is difficult to disaggregate the impact of pricing from other factors affecting\u00a0postal volumes such as e-substitution.  In terms of a suite of options to support the financial viability of national postal operators, pricing is playing a significant part in supporting the continuation of daily postal services. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100108#WRWW03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":2997,"qnumday":1112,"qnumall":"[12788\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100108#WRWW03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if proposals to provide financial assistance to An Post have been provided to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; if he has consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":2998,"content":"<p>There are no proposals to provide financial assistance to An Post and consequently the need to consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard has not arisen.

In short, the measures supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the highest number of people. While upgrading windows does improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of\u00a0this measure is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless as we move towards deeper renovation of homes, as will be necessary to meet our 2020 and 2030 climate and energy goals, window replacement could become cost effective as part of a wider package of upgrades to the fabric of a building. My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland\u00a0(SEAI) are now testing out the channels for carrying out deeper renovation in\u00a0homes across the country to inform future policy.<\/p>  <p>  For this reason\u00a0window upgrades are eligible for funding under the Better Energy Communities scheme in 2017, when carried out as part of a combined fabric upgrade, which also includes upgrades to insulation, ventilation and doors. Grant funding is available for up to 50% of the cost of these works in homes. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under the Warmth and Wellbeing pilot scheme, which is led by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Health, energy efficient windows and doors are installed wherever a surveyor deems them necessary. Earlier this month I\u00a0announced that homes\u00a0with particularly low thermal efficiency, that qualify for the Warmer Homes Scheme,\u00a0will now be eligible for a deeper retrofit package in addition to the currently funded measures. <\/p>  <p>  I have also\u00a0requested SEAI to review the measures that are supported through the SEAI home energy grant\u00a0schemes and the results of this review will inform any future measures that may be offered.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also note that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government\u00a0funds the Housing Aid for Older People scheme.

The development of sectoral mitigation measures for the electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture sectors to be set out in a National Mitigation Plan (NMP) is well advanced.  The primary objective of the first NMP will be to monitor measures already underway and identify potential additional measures that, in the medium to longer term, will reduce GHG emissions.  This will assist Ireland to achieve our national transition objective to become a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the end of 2050.\u00a0 Following a public consultation launched last week, the NMP will be submitted to Government for approval in June.   The overarching objective of the Energy White Paper, published in December 2015, is to transition to a low carbon energy system which provides secure supplies of competitive and affordable energy to citizens and businesses.  This will involve moving away from higher emissions fuel types to lower emissions fuels such as gas, or zero carbon renewable energy technologies.

Measures already in place include the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff Schemes, \u00a0Biofuels Obligation Scheme, Low Emission Vehicle incentivisation and\u00a0National Policy on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure\u00a0for Transport.  The\u00a0range of mitigating measures currently under consideration\u00a0includes the development of a new support scheme for renewable electricity, a renewable heat incentive, increased penetration of renewable energy in the transport energy mix and\u00a0further incentivisation of low emission vehicles.  An opportunity for the Agriculture, Forest and Land Use sector to contribute to renewable energy was also identified and this includes biofuels being potentially produced from agricultural waste and for forest-based biomass and residues to be used to produce heat and\/or power through combustion or anaerobic digestion. The draft Plan also highlights the need to prepare options for the removal of fossil fuel subsidies as a key cross-cutting action.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the first National Mitigation Plan represents an initial step to set us on a pathway to achieve the level of decarbonisation required by 2050.  It does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the 2050 objective, but rather\u00a0is a work in progress reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition.  When finalised, the Plan will become a living document, accessible on my Department's website, which is continually updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  In addition, there will be the formal preparation of successive National Mitigation Plans at least once every five years as provided for in the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100110#WRYY04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Priorities","counter":3100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100110#WRYY04300"},{"type":"question","counter":3101,"qnumday":1152,"qnumall":"[14267\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100110#WRYY04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his priorities under the headings of communications, climate action and the environment; the extent to which targets are being met; his plans for the future in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3102,"content":"<p>The mission of my Department, as set out in our Statement of Strategy 2016 -2019, is to support economic and social progress and help the country reach its full potential by:  <\/p><p>-  facilitating the development of communications and energy infrastructure and markets;<\/p><p>-  leading the national transition to a sustainable, low-carbon, resource-efficient economy;<\/p><p>-  protecting and improving our high-quality natural environment;<\/p><p>-  ensuring the sustainable and productive use of our natural resources; and<\/p><p>-  promoting the development of the public and private broadcasting sectors.<\/p><p>The Statement of Strategy is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link  <i>www.dccae.gov.ie\/SiteCollectionDocuments\/About-Us\/Statement%20of%20Strategy%202016-2019.pdf.<\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i>The objectives set out in the Statement of Strategy across the various sectors for which the Department is responsible, together with the Programme for Government and EU obligations, guide and inform the departmental priorities for each year.\u00a0 Priorities for 2017 include delivery of the National Broadband Plan, publishing the first National Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Plans, publication of a National Clean Air Strategy and the introduction a new Renewable Heat Incentive and Renewable Electricity Support Scheme. <\/p><p>My Department is required to prepare an annual report on progress on its priorities.

However, given ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I have no statutory function in the matter of mobile phone coverage.<\/p><p>I\u00a0am, however,\u00a0critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Any customer who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p><p>I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.  However,\u00a0mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and\u00a0the capacity of the network, as well as by\u00a0and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.  The\u00a0rate of demand for data services has increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with\u00a0Minister Humphreys to\u00a0identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate\u00a0how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The\u00a0report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. <\/p><p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This group will drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on\u00a0progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report in April, following the end of this quarter. <\/p><p>In addition, I have\u00a0signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.\u00a0<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100110#WRYY05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":3108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100110#WRYY05100"},{"type":"question","counter":3109,"qnumday":1154,"qnumall":"[14269\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100110#WRYY05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress in relation to the provision of high quality and high speed broadband in all areas throughout the country with particular reference to facilitating the increasing number of persons working from their homes and as a result eliminating road traffic congestion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3110,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband\u00a0to all businesses and households\u00a0in Ireland\u00a0 through policy and regulatory measures by\u00a0acting\u00a0as a catalyst to\u00a0commercial investment\u00a0and by State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 Since the publication of the NBP,\u00a0 investment by the\u00a0commercial telecommunications sector has been considerable with over &euro;2.5bn spent in upgrading and modernising networks.\u00a0 As a result, today, approximately 1.4m (61%) of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.\u00a0Significant\u00a0growth is anticipated over the next 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The latest ComReg quarterly report highlights that over 65% of all broadband customers now\u00a0avail of high speed broadband services \u00a0( &amp;gt; 30 Megabits per second).<\/p><p>My Department is running\u00a0a procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a\u00a0high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.<\/p><p>My Department\u00a0has also been actively monitoring commercial\u00a0plans. \u00a0As a result, the\u00a0High Speed Broadband Map will be updated in the coming weeks to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The finalisation of the\u00a0Intervention Area is a key step in the procurement process and will help bidders prepare for the next phase.\u00a0\u00a0The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered\u00a0during the procurement process.

The EPA performs a wide range of statutory functions in fulfilment of its mandate.  For example, the EPA has a key role in licensing facilities with the potential for significant environmental pollution, to ensure that their emissions do not endanger human health or harm the environment.  The EPA is responsible for issuing Industrial Emission Directive Licenses; Integrated Pollution and Control (IPC) Licenses; Waste Licences; Waste Water Discharge Authorisations; Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Authorisations; and Radiological Protection Licences.<\/p><p>The EPA also encourages participation in its regulatory activities, through providing input to its decision making processes and reporting any negative environmental impacts from facilities that it licences such as odours, noise or water pollution.

Their bravery, dedication and commitment is nothing short of remarkable.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the question, it is true that the Irish Coast Guard is not a separately established legal entity. It is a division of my Department.  It was established as such under a Government Decision in 1990, initially as the Irish Marine Emergency Service, the name was later changed to the Irish Coast Guard in 2000, and the division was subsequently transferred from the Department of the Marine to the Department of Transport in 2006.  Notwithstanding its functional location as a division of my Department it is in all operational respects a stand-alone primary response agency.<\/p>  <p>  The IRCG have a number of functions, which include inter alia, Search and Rescue (SAR) and Maritime Pollution Prevention and Response.  I am satisfied that the Irish Coast Guard has sufficient powers as a division of my Department, to carry out its functions.  These powers are augmented by the various Merchant Shipping and Sea Pollution legislation which I have previously outlined in answer to a parliamentary question, on 15\u00a0November 2016 (Ref. 34648\/16). \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am of the view, in light of the context set out above, that there is no need to place the IRCG on any additional statutory footing.

Legislating for a voluntary group would give rise to very complex matters and in all probability the volunteer sector would not be covered in any such legislation, as is evidenced by the Civil Defence Act which does not contain any provisions in respect of its large volunteer force.  The same applies to matters such as training standards, which are dynamic and constantly evolving, and which are not, therefore an appropriate subject for legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In these circumstances, I see no need to bring forward legislative proposals at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100113#WRBBB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3296,"content":"<p>Question No. 1221 answered with Question No. 1178.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Expenditure","counter":3297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100113#WRBBB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":3298,"qnumday":1222,"qnumall":"[13639\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100113#WRBBB04500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if funding will be provided for a road junction (details supplied) in view of the fact there has been an increase in road traffic accidents in this area.","asker":"1362","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3299,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in Dublin is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

In\u00a0Budget 2017 I secured an additional 11% in funding levels which means that\u00a0this year my Department will provide almost &euro;263 million to the National Transport Authority\u00a0(NTA) to fund PSO transport services.  This increased level of funding is assisting with the delivery of new and improved services which is reflected in the increases in passenger numbers across the\u00a0PSO network in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2017 also increased the amount of funding available to support the Rural Transport Programme which will assist with the further improvement of existing services and the development of new services under that Programme.  A key feature of the Programme's development is greater integration with other public transport services and enhancing public transport connectivity in rural Ireland overall.<\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of any proposed reductions in services through either Castlecomer or Thomastown as referred to by the Deputy. Castlecomer is currently served by a number of commercial bus services provided by different private operators.  Thomastown is served by a mixture of commercial bus services, PSO bus services and of course PSO supported rail services.<\/p>  <p>  Of course I am aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann has made proposals relating to its commercial X7 Expressway service which currently calls at Callan.  While those service changes have not yet been introduced, the Deputy will be aware that the NTA has published its assessment of the impact of the proposed withdrawal of the X7.  That NTA assessment notes that Callan will continue to be served by another commercial bus service. In terms of the broader regional impact of the withdrawal of the X7 Expressway, the NTA has\u00a0proposed some timetabling adjustments to a Rural Transport Programme route to ensure continued regional connectivity with that other service.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy rightly notes that in addition to the Exchequer funding provided under my Department's PSO programme,\u00a0funding is also made available through programmes managed by other Departments.  In relation to the Department of\u00a0Education and Skills' School Transport Scheme, I am informed by that Department that it provided &euro;156 million to Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2016 in relation to the company's administration of the Scheme.\u00a0\u00a0The Department of Social Protection recently stated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport that it expects approximately &euro;77 million in funding will this year be provided to operators in relation to the\u00a0operation of the Free Travel Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100113#WRBBB06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taxi Data","counter":3318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100113#WRBBB06500"},{"type":"question","counter":3319,"qnumday":1229,"qnumall":"[13864\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100113#WRBBB06600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of taxis currently licensed and in use that are over ten years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3320,"content":"<p>The regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry, including issues relating to licences, is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.<\/p><p>I have therefore referred your question to the NTA for direct reply to you.

As you will be aware, I have already announced that I am appointing the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) as the Competent Authority to deal with aircraft noise management at Dublin airport.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in order to finalise the details of the Statutory Instrument which will transpose EU Regulation 598\/2014.  The Regulation provides that the Competent Authority shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action and that independence may be achieved through functional separation.  The details of achieving independence through\u00a0this functional separation model are being developed in order to\u00a0ensure that\u00a0the IAA's role, in noise management, is fit for purpose to carry out all requirements of the EU Regulation\u00a0and indeed international Regulations according to ICAO principles.\u00a0 The IAA has an excellent track record in overseeing aviation safety and has an in-depth understanding of aircraft and the operational procedures that play a major role in noise management and I have every confidence in the IAA to carry out this important Regulatory function.<\/p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, I\u00a0wish to ensure that there are\u00a0robust consultation requirements with all key stakeholders, including local residents.\u00a0\u00a0It is proposed that\u00a0the Statutory Instrument\u00a0will outline requirements concerning the collaborative working arrangements\u00a0to apply between the Competent Authority\u00a0and the various\u00a0statutory bodies that have roles and expertise in relation to noise management.  Insofar as public participation arrangements are concerned, before the IAA as Competent Authority makes any decision about noise-related operating restrictions at the airport, there will be an obligation for\u00a0public consultation and all stakeholders will be able to give their views.  The IAA will ensure that\u00a0public consultation will respect\u00a0national law and\u00a0international obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Statutory Instrument is nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to sign off on this important piece of legislation in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100114#WRCCC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Policy","counter":3356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100114#WRCCC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":3357,"qnumday":1244,"qnumall":"[14163\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100114#WRCCC03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress on implementation of the national cycle policy framework received from local authorities and other stakeholders in 2013 and 2015.","asker":"1294","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":3358,"qnumday":1245,"qnumall":"[14164\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100114#WRCCC03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress which has been made in considering a ban on the movement of HGVs on routes to schools and other specific routes with mixed traffic between 08:30 to 09:30 and 15:00 to 17:00, in pursuance of policy 2.4 of the national cycle policy framework.","asker":"1294","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":3359,"qnumday":1246,"qnumall":"[14165\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100114#WRCCC03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress which has been made in carrying out a study on bicycles, ferries and ports in pursuance of policy 8.9 of the national cycle policy framework.","asker":"1294","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":3360,"qnumday":1247,"qnumall":"[14166\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100114#WRCCC03400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the steps which have been taken to encourage employers to provide cycling parking facilities at existing developments, in pursuance of policy 7.3 of the national cycle policy framework.","asker":"1294","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":3361,"qnumday":1248,"qnumall":"[14167\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100114#WRCCC03500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the support which has been provided for introduction of emergency hotlines in all local authorities to enable the public to report potholes and inadequate reinstatement of roads, broken glass on the road and so on, in pursuance of policy 5.5 of the national cycle policy framework.","asker":"1294","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":3362,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1244 to 1248, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  While significant progress has been made under a number of objectives contained in the National Cycle Policy Framework (NCPF), including some of those referenced by the Deputy,\u00a0my Department has not yet undertaken a formal review of the policy framework or its implementation.  However, the\u00a0NCPF has been integrated into the Development Plans of the majority of local authorities so ensuring that the objectives and policies to support and promote cycling are taken account of in current and future planning.

The 2017 Action Plan for Jobs calls for the Roll out the Women&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship Initiative and to further develop female centred entrepreneurial and start up initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses.  In 2016, 60% of participants attending their training programmes were female with 44% of the mentoring participants were female.  More than 900 businesswomen attended the range of 2016 annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day events.  This was considered highly successful and it is planned to run NWED 2017 in a similar format.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has been running female only feasibility and competitive funds since 2012.  The Female Entrepreneurship Unit had another successful year with an increase in female-led start-ups to 63, including 19 High Potential Start-Ups.  The next Female Specific Start Fund will open on 3\u00a0May 2017 which will accelerate the growth of female-led start-up companies.<\/p>  <p>  An important aspect of the networking programme is the promotion of successful female entrepreneurs as role models and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence of newly emerging female entrepreneurs.  In 2017, The Female Leadership and Growing Ambition Conference hosted by Enterprise Ireland took place on 9th March in Bank of Ireland, College Green.  The Female Founders Roadshow visited six locations: Dundalk, Galway, Athlone, Donegal, Limerick and Cork. EI also sponsor awards such as Tatler Business Woman of the Year Awards.  They developed a series of female accelerator programmes in partnership with knowledge providers.  These included Going for Growth and the DCU Ryan Academy Female Propeller Programme.<\/p>  <p>  These initiatives demonstrate that the Government is firmly backing female entrepreneurship and considers it an important area of job creation within the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100115#WRDDD04350","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":3441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100115#WRDDD04450"},{"type":"question","counter":3442,"qnumday":1276,"qnumall":"[13247\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100115#WRDDD04500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she has read a report on Brexit (details supplied) which indicates that Ireland is among two countries whose GDPs will suffer the biggest drop as a consequence of Brexit as indicated in pages seven, eight and ten of the report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":3443,"content":"<p>I am aware of the CEPS research and welcome this contribution to the ongoing Brexit debate.  <\/p><p>The report recognises that Ireland faces unique challenges from Brexit, especially given the all-Ireland issues that arise.  <\/p><p>The extremely close nature of our trading relationship with the UK means that the scale of the overall economic impact is probably greater for Ireland than for many other partners.  The direct trading relationship between Ireland and the UK is enormous: &euro;1.2 billion is traded between the two countries every week, with a considerable volume transiting through the UK onward to other EU Member States.  <\/p><p>The UK is the most important market for Irish goods and services and we are Britain's fifth largest export market. <\/p><p>As a consequence\u00a0of the importance of this issue, there is a whole of Government approach in place focusing on Brexit issues and my Department and its agencies are to the forefront of this effort. <\/p><p>In advance of the Referendum my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas of my Department.

This research will inform an assessment of the way in which Brexit will affect individual sectors of the economy, and the ongoing response by Government and the Enterprise Agencies. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Enterprise Agencies are playing an active and vital role in our response to Brexit.  For example, Enterprise Ireland has engaged in extensive outreach with\u00a0each of its 1,476 client companies that export to the UK - critically these companies employ 100,000 full time employees across all regions of Ireland.  EI is driving competitiveness in Irish companies through a suite of supports to reduce supply-chain costs and increase efficiencies as a means of improving operating margins.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio and continues to actively pursue any opportunity for mobile investment following the Brexit announcement.  FDI opportunities are likely to be found along differing timelines, partially influenced by sector.  The potential sources of FDI are likely to come from:<\/p><p>- existing IDA Clients with a presence in Ireland who also have a presence in the UK;<\/p><p>- overseas clients (US, European and Asian) who have a presence in the UK but not in Ireland;<\/p><p>- UK companies operating in the UK who now need certain access to the European Market; and<\/p><p>- International clients without a presence in Europe seeking a European home. <\/p><p>Further, my Department is also funding a project through InterTrade Ireland on the North-South trade implications of Brexit.  This project will provide an understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Finally, my Department is leading consideration of the trade and investment impacts arising from Brexit and will reflect the CEPS research in\u00a0its ongoing\u00a0programme of research and analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100115#WRDDD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Board Remuneration","counter":3445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3446,"qnumday":1277,"qnumall":"[13333\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will confirm that in line with the one person-one salary principle, no public servant who is a member of a State board or agency under the control of her Department is currently in receipt of remuneration in the form of board fees and if any such remuneration is being paid that such payment will be discontinued and payments that were wrongfully paid will be reclaimed.","asker":"1349","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":3447,"content":"<p>The following State Boards are under the remit of my Department:<\/p><p>- The Competition and Consumer Commission<\/p><p>- Enterprise Ireland<\/p><p>- The Health and Safety Authority<\/p><p>- IDA Ireland<\/p><p>- The Personal Injuries Assessment Board<\/p><p>- Science Foundation Ireland<\/p><p>- The National Standards Authority of Ireland<\/p><p>- The Low Pay Commission<\/p><p>- The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority<\/p><p>In line with the once person one salary principle, I can confirm that no public servant who is a member of these Boards or Agencies is in receipt of remuneration in the form of board fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":3448,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":3449,"qnumday":1278,"qnumall":"[13494\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her Department has a record of any employer making an inquiry regarding employing and sponsoring the residency of a person (details supplied) on the basis of their skills.","asker":"1432","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":3450,"content":"<p>The Employment Permits Acts 2003 &ndash; 2014 provide that in order to work in the State all non-EEA nationals require a valid Employment Permit from my Department or relevant immigration permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality which allows them to reside and work in the State without the requirement for an Employment Permit. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish State's general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the European Union and other EEA states.

(It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction\/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses).<\/p><p>For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training and\/or provide a mentor to work directly with the business proposer.  The suite of training programmes provided by the LEOs covers a variety of business functions such as: financial management, sales &amp;amp; marketing, social media, HR, operations, customer care, innovation, competitiveness and management development.<\/p><p>Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to Microfinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.<\/p><p>Further information on the services available from the LEOs can be accessed at <i>www.localenterprise.ie.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":3457,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":3458,"qnumday":1281,"qnumall":"[13750\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of staff employed within her Department for each of the years from 2012 to 2016 and to date in 2017 in\u00a0tabular form;

I am working very closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure we have\u00a0the required pipeline of\u00a0skills supply in terms of both quantity and quality to meet the current and future needs of the enterprise sector. \u00a0I am particularly pleased that there has been an increase in the level of uptake of STEM at second level according to Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).  This has increased to 273,000 in 2016 compared to 253,000 in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0have noted\u00a0the early indications of a drop in the number of students applying through the CAO to do third level courses in engineering and technology in 2017 as against 2016.\u00a0 However, I note also that the number of students applying in 2017 (34,850) is similar to the numbers that applied in 2015 (35,210) and is higher than the number of students who applied in 2014 (32,444) and in 2013 (29,730).\u00a0 We will continue to focus on promoting the opportunities in\u00a0STEM-related careers over the coming months as students consider their options and\u00a0aligned with the CAO change of mind\u00a0timelines. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would\u00a0draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to a number of initiatives being undertaken by my\u00a0Department and its Agencies to promote STEM careers.  For example, Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), an Agency under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, leads the\u00a0Smart Futures initiative,\u00a0which focuses on driving awareness of careers in STEM at post-primary level.\u00a0 It is\u00a0a government-industry-education programme, which is\u00a0co-ordinated and managed by SFI, in partnership with the Engineers Ireland's STEPS programme.  It is\u00a0supported by over 50 organisations from research and academia, as well as\u00a0partners such as BioPharma Ireland, the Royal Society of Chemistry,\u00a0ICT Ireland, the Irish Medical Devices Association (IMDA), the Institute of Physics,\u00a0the American Chamber of Commerce and many other stakeholder groups.\u00a0 The smartfutures.ie website, developed as part of the programme is a rich information resource for students, teachers, parents and guidance counsellors providing information on the four streams under STEM (S &ndash; Science), (T &ndash; Technology), (E &ndash; Engineering) and (M- Maths) and the career pathways available to students.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Separate to the Smart Futures Initiative, SFI continues to promote the advancement of STEM education and learning.\u00a0 The Government&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy was published in January 2016.\u00a0 The Strategy identifies Ireland&rsquo;s current skills profile, provides a strategic vision and specific objectives for Ireland&rsquo;s future skills requirements, including in the STEM area and sets out a road map for how the vision and objectives can be achieved.\u00a0 During the Strategy&rsquo;s first year, progress has been made and a number of initiatives have been actioned, including:\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>Action 18 - Increase support for the Smart Futures and SFI Discover programmes and build on success of initiatives including Student Enterprise Awards, CoderDojo, Science Week Ireland, BT Young Scientist. (Innovation 2020).<\/p>  <p>  Smart Futures continuing ongoing activities with over 100,000 students engaged and over 1,600 role models trained over the first three year strategy.  Women in STEM forum held in SFI to connect programmes targeting young females.  Science Week audience reach broadened including two new regional festivals, an extensive programming schedule on RT&Eacute; and a larger social media presence.  Science Rising communications campaign delivered through 2016 highlighting the science of the everyday to Irish public.  42 projects supported through the SFI Discover programme call to promote and support STEM engagement and education of Irish public.<\/p>  <p>Action 28 - Work with the National Parents Councils for Primary and Post-Primary to disseminate skills and labour market information to parents in accessible formats.<\/p>  <p>  SFI and National Parents Council completed a survey of primary school parents to inform activity.\u00a0 A parents&rsquo; advice brochure has been\u00a0developed.  Parent information sessions have been delivered.  Skills and labour market information aimed at parents are\u00a0available on the\u00a0Smart Futures website.<\/p>  <p>Action 62 - Working with industry volunteers and schools, seek to ensure every second level school is offered at least one school visit annually through the Smart Futures School Visit Programme.<\/p>  <p>  Every school has been contacted and offered a visit.  Every school may request a Smart Futures visit on the Smart Futures website.  SFI attended student &amp;amp; teacher conferences and events e.g. BT Young Scientists Exhibition and TY Expo, advertising Smart Futures to teachers.<\/p>  <p>Action 113 - Increase enrolments of postgraduate researchers to address demand in the economy. (Innovation 2020).<\/p>  <p>  Funding has been secured to increase activity across SFI programmes, most of which fund postgraduate researchers.  SFI is designing a PhD programme to develop and enhance the skills of PhD students through cohort-based, discipline centric, PhD programmes to ensure the provision of a skilled in demand workforce to meet the demands of industry and academia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":3463,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3464,"qnumday":1283,"qnumall":"[14065\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100116#WREEE01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 308 of 8 March 2017, the number of workplace inspections and total amount of wages recovered in 2016 for the child care sector alone; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":3465,"content":"<p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an independent, statutory body established on 1st October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015.

An initial group of 16 young people have been identified by French officials to be the first to go through the assessment process to come to Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  When this issue was first coming to public prominence I obtained a clear plan from my officials and from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Tusla provided me with cost estimates but has correctly added the proviso that these will have to be monitored as the needs of the young people are not yet fully known.  This estimate was provided prior to individual assessments regarding age or needs of the young people concerned.  Due to trauma experienced by the young people and  personal challenges the most suitable service to meet the needs of the young people may be a residential setting.  As the Deputy will understand residential care is the most expensive type of care provided by Tusla.  Additionally, included in the estimate was the provision of therapeutic and legal supports.  As the young people arrive, we will get a better understanding of their needs. <\/p>  <p>  The estimate refers to a full year cost but as the young people will be arriving on a phased basis the cost for 2017 should be considerably less.

Early Years Care and Education (ECCE): <\/p>  <p>  The ECCE programme provides free pre-school three hours per day, five days per week.  From September 2016 children are eligible to start free pre-school once they turn 3 (and are not more than 4 years and 8 months), and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June).  Children are able to enrol in free pre-school at three different points in the year - September, January and April - so that they can access free pre-school as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  Prior to Budget 2016, families benefitted from 38 weeks of free pre-school.  This has now been increased to 61 weeks on average (ranging from 51 weeks to 88 weeks).  It has been estimated that this 61 weeks of ECCE reduces parents childcare costs by &euro;4,000 (per child).<\/p>  <p>2.  Community Childcare Subvention (CCS):<\/p>  <p>  The CCS Programme provides support for parents on various social protection payments, in low paid employment, and training or education, by enabling qualifying parents to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating community childcare services.  A childcare funding subsidy is provided to childcare services and the parent pays the remainder of the services childcare fee.  CCS is available through participating community not-for-profit childcare services and is also available through participating private providers through the CCS Private programme.  The maximum subsidisation\/payment per child, per week, is &euro;95.00 (to be deducted from the weekly childcare fee). <\/p>  <p>3. Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Programmes:<\/p>  <p>The objective of the TEC Programmes is to support parents on eligible training courses and eligible categories of parents returning to work, by providing subsidised childcare places.  The TEC programmes are;<\/p>  <p>3.1. Childcare Education and Training Support programme (CETS).  The CETS Programme formerly catered for FAS and VEC training course participants and now provides childcare on behalf of the Local Education and Training Boards.<\/p>  <p>3.2. After-School Child Care programme (ASCC).  The ASCC is administered on behalf of the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and provides afterschool care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents and parents on DSP employment programmes (not including Community Employment). <\/p>  <p>3.3. Community Employment Childcare programme (CEC).  The CEC is administered on behalf of DSP and provides childcare for children of parents who are participating on Community Employment schemes. <\/p>  <p>The Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) is due to be introduced later this year.  It will subsume and replace all existing childcare programmes mentioned above, with the exception of the ECCE Programme, and will have both a universal and a targeted element.  The universal element of the scheme will cater for all children between the ages of 6 to 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the free pre-school programme if later) who are availing of childcare by a Tusla registered childcare service.  The targeted element of the scheme will cater for children aged from 6 months to 15 years.  This element of the scheme will be means tested and will be based on a parent&rsquo;s net income.  This will be a progressive system that ensures that those on the lower end of the income scale will receive the greatest subsidy.

They provide that each employee working directly with children attending a service must hold at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), or a qualification deemed to be equivalent.  The Regulations state that each service provider must ensure that their staff meet this standard.  This section of the regulations took effect on 30th June 2016 for new services registering after that date, and for all other services it took effect on 31st December 2016. <\/p>  <p>  My Department introduced this regulatory change following many years of consideration and consultation with the sector.  Notwithstanding that the requirements set out in the Regulations were well flagged for the past number of years, and mindful of the challenge that it would present to the sector, the Department introduced the following supportive measures:<\/p>  <p>a)  Learner Funds to provide sector workers with an opportunity to upskill to a Level 5 qualification.<\/p>  <p>b)  A qualifications assessment procedure, put in place by DCYA in the latter half of 2015, allows for applications to be made for individual qualifications assessment.

The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage, and to help break the cycle of child poverty in areas where it has become entrenched.<\/p>  <p>  The ABC Programme was preceded by the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) (2007-2013) in which three sites participated: Youngballymun, Preparing For Life (Dublin Northside), and the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght.

The total original funding for Youngballymun under the ABC programme was &euro;5 million bringing the total funding received by Youngballymun under both programmes to &euro;20 million. <\/p>  <p>  Owing to their earlier transition into the ABC programme, Youngballymun and the other two PEIP sites were contracted to deliver services in their areas until mid-2016.

In total 590 General Service Recruits (501 Army. 89 Navy) were inducted in 2016, along with 100 Cadets between all services.

In addition, a new General Service Recruitment campaign was launched on 23 February 2017, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the strength of the Defence Forces at 9,500 personnel.  The intake of Cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis, taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  The 2017 Cadetship competitions will be launched on 22 March 2017. This year Defence Forces are planning to induct 860 new entrants. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100118#WRGGG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Veterans","counter":3627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100118#WRGGG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":3628,"qnumday":1344,"qnumall":"[13842\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100118#WRGGG06000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide a service medal for members of the Defence Forces that were involved at Jadotville; if members of the Defence Forces will be acknowledged with a service medal for their tour of duty in the Congo; if retired members of the Defence Forces will be presented with the commemorative medal for 1916; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":3629,"content":"<p>The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff.  He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision.  The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company.  I organised and hosted a ceremony in Custume Barracks, Athlone on Saturday 17th  September 2016 at which a Unit Citation was presented to the Company in recognition of their collective heroism and professional performance during the Siege of Jadotville whilst cut-off from support and reinforcements. During the ceremony I presented a copy of the Citation to each member of the Unit or next-of-kin in the case of deceased members.  This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men. In addition, a specially commissioned insignia will be provided to the members and the next of kin of deceased members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; company in the coming weeks. These are awards that are used internationally by other militaries to recognise those Units that have served with particular distinction. <\/p>  <p>  Recognition of service on UN Peacekeeping missions is made through the awarding of a UN Service Medal.  The qualifying criteria for the award of a UN Service Medal were that personnel should have served on the UN mission for 90 days.  An inspection of the records for the UN Congo mission in 1961 would indicate that serving personnel received a UN Service Medal on return to their Parent Unit in Ireland dating from 1962.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Programme for Government, it was proposed that a commemorative medal be awarded to all Defence Forces personnel, Permanent and Reserve, who were recorded as being in service in the course of 2016.  Accordingly, retired members of the Defence Forces are eligible for the Medal if they were in service during 2016.  The awarding of the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal is a special acknowledgement from the Government to the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, both Permanent and Reserve, who have served during this centenary year of 2016. The medals were specially commissioned to mark the role the Defence Forces played in the centenary year.  It serves to honour the central role of the Defence Forces across all seven strands of the Centenary Programme throughout 2016.  They have played an essential role in our national commemorations, whether at the Commemoration at the GPO and the Parade on Easter Sunday, the ceremonies to mark the execution of the Leaders of the Rising or the formal delivery, to primary schools in the State, of our National Flag and a copy of the Proclamation.  There are no plans to issue the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to anyone who did not serve in 2016.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100118#WRGGG06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Medals","counter":3630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100118#WRGGG06200"},{"type":"question","counter":3631,"qnumday":1345,"qnumall":"[14108\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032100118#WRGGG06300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will review an application for a service medal (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":3632,"content":"<p>Decisions regarding the award of medals in respect of the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence are dependent on verification and corroborative evidence of the service involved.
