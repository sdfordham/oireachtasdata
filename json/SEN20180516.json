I appreciate that this is a particularly busy time for him and his presence this morning is to be appreciated by all.  I acknowledge the fact the Minister made an effort to come here to address this very important issue.<\/p> <p>As the Minister is aware, tomorrow 17 May marks the 44th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Some 33 people in Monaghan and Dublin lost their lives on that day and it turned out to be the worst loss of life of the entire period of the Troubles.  I take this opportunity to request of the Minister a renewed effort on his part and, indeed, on the part of the Government so that the files in relation to this particular issue are released by the British Government in order that the people of Dublin and, indeed, Monaghan can have final closure on this issue.<\/p> <p>It is difficult to imagine that 44 years on we are no wiser as to who was responsible, what happened or what group was responsible for this atrocity in which 33 people lost their lives - seven from County Monaghan and 26 from Dublin.  We can only imagine the pain the families continue to endure over this period of time and that pain is compounded by the absence of more than four decades of the truth of what actually happened on that day.  People have campaigned for many years.  Justice for the Forgotten deserves credit for its continued renewed efforts over many years to try to find justice and the truth of what happened.  Every year on the anniversary of this event, all Members of both Houses renew our determination to try to find some comfort for those who have suffered.  As the anniversary approaches tomorrow, our thoughts and our prayers are with the victims and their families at this difficult time of commemoration.<\/p> <p>I am sure it is difficult for the families to appreciate that no one has been charged, much less convicted for that day of carnage and the truth of what actually happened remains a mystery.  Indeed, the families' quest for truth and justice has been painfully slow, blocked in every direction and largely ignored.  The British Government must make those documents available.  There must be some international agreement that it is breaching by not so doing.  The British Government has said that it would set up an inquiry into what happened but we still await the outcome of that.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister in his new role and his new portfolio to reinvigorate our efforts and the efforts of the Government on behalf of the people of this country, especially the people of Monaghan and Dublin, to request the British Government to release the papers so that the families can finally bring closure to this and so that they can put the memories of their loved ones to rest and finally realise who or what was behind that atrocity on that fateful day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#A00250","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I am very aware that in the week of the 44th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings that this is hugely sensitive time for the families concerned.  That tragic incident saw the biggest loss of life in any single day during the Troubles, as pointed out by the Senator.  It is important to acknowledge politicians across the Oireachtas who work on a cross-party basis with the Government on this issue, in support of the tireless efforts of Justice for the Forgotten which is playing such an important role, in terms of trying to move this process forward.<\/p> <p>The Government will be represented at the wreath-laying ceremony tomorrow to mark the anniversary of these tragic events by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan.

These motions call on the British Government to allow access to an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Mr. Seamus Ludlow.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-party motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department.  I raised the issue again in person with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, last month and my officials were in touch with their British counterparts as recently as last week.

As he is aware, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health.  We produced a report on orphan drugs, in particular trying to fast-track the process and bring more certainty at an earlier stage.  I understand that the assessment process for many drugs here takes, on average, 23 months before a decision is made on moving forward to the next stage in the process.  The people who are doing research and development in this area spend a lot of time and money trying to bring forward products which can be of benefit to people.  Likewise, the number of people who would benefit from such drugs is quite small but it is very important to them.  Over the past two or three years, a number of ongoing battles about whether a drug would receive approval have taken place in the public domain.

Medicines play a vital role in improving the overall health of Irish patients.  Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish health service.  The challenge is to deliver on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p><p>As of 11 May 2018, there are 120 orphan drugs in Europe.  Of these, 12 have been refused by the European Medicines Agency, four have been withdrawn and 104 have had approvals.  It is expected that the trend will be towards more applications for orphan drugs in the years ahead.  That is why it is essential that Ireland has a scientific, robust and evidence-based assessment process in place.  This ensures that decisions on the reimbursement of medicines are made on an objective and scientific basis, recognising the health needs of the population and other factors.<\/p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides the legal framework in Ireland for such a process.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of expert opinion as appropriate.  The HSE follows the process set out in the Act for the assessment of all drugs, including orphan drugs.  While orphan drugs are assessed in the same way as other drugs, the HSE is mindful of the differences and challenges in terms of patient numbers. <\/p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible and within 180 days.  However, because of the significant moneys involved, the HSE must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis.  Successful price negotiations also allow for further drugs to be approved within the finite budget available.<\/p><p>A study published in December 2017 in the <i>European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology<\/i>concluded that the majority of European countries do not have a separate reimbursement system for orphan drugs.  The Department of Health has received the report on evaluating orphan drugs from the Joint Committee on Health.  The Department is examining the committee&rsquo;s report and its recommendations.  The report raises some significant policy issues which require careful consideration.  <\/p><p>The Minister and the Department are very aware of the human side of this entire process.  A medicinal products review committee has been established as part of the recommendations advocated by the national rare disease plan.  This committee will look at the possibility of devising managed access programmes for patients, including orphan drugs, and will consider the need for different assessment criteria to apply in the case of drugs for rare diseases.  The Government is committed in the programme for partnership to look at opportunities for leveraging purchasing power.  That is why, over the past two years, my Department has been engaging with other European countries in an effort to identify solutions to medicines pricing, sustainability and supply.<\/p><p>Ireland is participating in several voluntary EU forums, including round-table meetings with EU health Ministers and the pharmaceutical industry, high level pharmaceutical policy meetings, the BeNeLuxA collaboration and the Valletta technical committee.  These platforms are currently exploring possible areas for co-operation including information sharing, horizon scanning and possible price negotiations and joint procurement.<\/p><p>Ensuring timely and sustainable access to new medicines, especially orphan medicines, is a key priority of the Minister.  The Department and the HSE are actively working towards this goal.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#B00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The European Medicines Agency approves drugs and we then seem to go through a process which takes over two years.

This is the fifth occasion on which I have raised this issue.  I have raised it three times on the Order of Business and this is the second Commencement matter I have tabled in respect of it.  More than six months have passed since I raised it by way of a Commencement matter.  At that point, it had already been two and a half years since enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  It is now three years since the legislation was passed but families, particularly LGBTQI couples who conceive through assisted human reproduction methods, still do not have equal family status because the Government has not commenced Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  Why is this taking so long?  The impact of this Government inaction includes preventing a family from applying for an Irish passport and citizenship for their child, preventing the child from accessing his or her parents' estate if they die and preventing a parent from making emergency health decisions on behalf of a child where the legal parent is unable to do so.<\/p> <p>During the debate on the Commencement matter I tabled in December 2017, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, said, \"If possible, it will be implemented by the end of January and if not, then the beginning of February.\"  This followed repeated missed deadlines on the part of the Department.  These deadlines were late 2016, early 2017, mid-2017 and late 2017.  Following parliamentary questions or questions on promised legislation in the D&aacute;il on the topic, the Department's responses have omitted a deadline and simply state that a small number of technical issues are holding matters up and that Parts 2 and 3 will be commenced as soon as possible.  The most recent responses have the added element of requiring advice from the Attorney General.  It has taken the Department over two years just to figure this out.  Surely these technical issues would have been resolved by now had they have been given priority over the past three years.  We need an open and honest explanation of the delay and a truthful deadline as to when families can expect certainty on this issue.<\/p> <p>The Leader, Senator Buttimer, sought a meeting last month involving me, departmental officials and the families affected but the Department rejected his request.  All I wish is for departmental officials to meet the families affected and explain why they have delayed the commencement of these people's rights and left them vulnerable.  As matters stand, the families are being stonewalled.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to give an in-depth explanation as to why the Department has taken three years to provide crucial rights to LGBTQI families and give a definite timeline as to when they can expect these rights to be conferred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#C00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types.

The responsibility of my Department relates solely to the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 and associated regulations.  As well as making regulations in respect of donor-assisted human reproduction procedures, Parts 2 and 3 make provision for children conceived through the assistance of a donor.  This includes mandating for non-anonymous donation and the establishment of a national donor-conceived person register to enable children to access information on their donor and genetically related siblings when they come of age, should they so wish.<\/p> <p>These provisions were specifically included in the Act to underpin the rights of the child under Article 42A of the Constitution and Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to have information on genetic heritage.  Detailed regulation of these provisions will ensure that the information on any child born of donor conception will be recorded securely, in compliance with existing and forthcoming data protection legislation, and in a manner which can be accessed by that child when he or she is of age.  Parts 2 and 3 also provide legal clarity on parental rights and responsibilities.<\/p> <p>Officials in my Department have prepared draft regulations to facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.

Like many hospitals throughout the country, Sligo University Hospital faces many ongoing challenges, including cost pressures, recruitment issues, inpatient and day-case waiting lists, OPD waiting times and increased trolley pressures.  Among the biggest challenges is that relating to bed capacity and Sligo University Hospital is no different from many other hospitals in seeking additional beds.  Unfortunately, Sligo University Hospital&rsquo;s capacity has reduced by 13% over the past ten years .  Put simply, it needs more beds.  The situation has been aggravated by the hospital losing 42 inpatient beds since 2004 and the increase in trolley pressures has presented a clear-cut case for additional bed capacity.  This capacity challenge is set to become greater because Ireland has an ageing population.  In that context, it is estimated that there will be a 40% increase in the number of people aged 65 and over in the next ten years.<\/p> <p>We are all aware of the huge pressures on bed capacity in our hospitals, especially during winter months.  Last January was no different, with emergency departments such as that in Sligo under enormous strain due to high demand and the increased incidence of flu mainly affecting older people.  Many Senators will be aware that the recent health service capacity review identified the need for 2,600 additional acute hospital beds over the next ten years.  I understand that 600 will become available nationally in the coming year.  The Government is fully committed to the provision of these extra acute hospital beds under the Project Ireland 2040 framework unveiled in Sligo last February.<\/p> <p>I also take this opportunity to appeal directly to Minister for Health to ensure that Sligo University Hospital gets its fair share of these additional beds.  I hope that some of these beds - with the associated staffing - can come on stream prior to next winter.  Extra beds for Sligo will also certainly help smooth the transition to the new surgical and emergency department block being developed at the hospital.  Many other excellent projects being planned at the hospital, such as the development of a cardiac catheterisation laboratory service, a radiology suite, a diabetes day unit and a central sterile services department, CSSD, upgrade.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend the hospital on its ongoing efforts to advance these projects but increased bed capacity continues to be a key priority.

I understand that approximately 200 beds opened last winter across some of our hospitals, and more are due to come on stream later in the year.  I attended a meeting in Sligo over two weeks ago when the management team briefed local politicians on all the various matters affecting them.

As he will be aware, the Department of Health has undertaken a health service capacity review in line with the programme for a partnership Government commitment, the findings of which provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.  If reforms are implemented, the report concludes, as the Senator points out, that nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds will be required by 2031.  As a first step towards implementing this recommendation, I have asked my Department to work with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system that can be opened and staffed this year and in 2019.  The HSE is continuing to develop this proposal, with the aim of formulating an evidence-based plan for increasing bed capacity nationally, which will form the basis of discussions with colleagues in government on the financing of this important programme of work.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan has specifically asked me to speak today on proposed plans for Sligo University Hospital.  I can confirm that the HSE has been working with the Saolta hospital group on the development of specific proposals for all its hospitals.  Currently, this includes a proposal for a new modular build for Sligo University Hospital that would increase bed capacity at this site by up to 52 inpatient beds.  The proposal in respect of Sligo University Hospital, along with all those submitted by other hospitals, is currently being assessed by the HSE in terms of its feasibility, including matters of staffing, costing, timeline and impact, with a view to bringing an overall plan to my Department for consideration and discussion with colleagues in government.  Therefore, while I understand the Senator's wish to have a clear response on this matter today, I must await the outcome of the process under way.<\/p> <p>As outlined in the capacity review, the demographic pressures being experienced by the health service are such as to demand not just additional capacity but continued emphasis on health and well-being initiatives, an improved model of care with a stronger role for enhanced community-based services and continued improvement in productivity, including in acute hospitals.  The Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years.  This will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand.  Importantly, the accelerated introduction of additional capacity for 2018 and 2019 will be matched by forthcoming reforms, including the publication of a detailed Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan and the overhaul of the current GP contract.<\/p> <p>We all acknowledge that the challenges we face are significant and of that there is little doubt.  However, it is my firm belief that all of us want to find the right solutions - patient-centred, evidence-based, results-focused and sustainable - to the challenges currently facing our health services.  I know we have a long road ahead of us but 2018 will be the start of this journey of reform and strengthening of our health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The latest figures, for March, show a further increase in the number on the CAMHS waiting list in the capital, from 156 at the end of 2017, to 164.  We all talk about early intervention being the best way to improve outcomes for children but we see absolutely no action.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Health to look at CAMHS services as children and adolescents are our future and we need to invest in them now.  Early intervention is crucial.  This also applies to waiting lists for speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  The waiting lists are getting bigger and nobody seems to be getting any treatment.<\/p><p>My second issue relates to housing and, particularly, the rental market in Dublin.  We have a peculiar situation here with tourists in residential accommodation and the homeless in hotels.  In 2017, Dublin City Council spent &euro;97.48 million on emergency accommodation, with some hotels in our city being paid over &euro;1 million.  We learn from a <i>daft.ie<\/i>report today that over half of rental properties in Dublin are listed on a short-term basis only.  That means 53% of homes on the Dublin rental market are not available to long-term tenants.  It is easy to remedy this.  It has been brought to the Government's attention time and time again.  The Government must put in place legislation to disincentivise this market behaviour.  It has been highlighted before and it is time for the Government to take action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>This is my first opportunity to address the House since the very disappointing decision by Apple to scrap its plans for a data centre in Athenry in Galway.  I can tell Senators that, even from my brief discussions with the business community in the US, this has generated a real negative feel factor about the investment environment in Ireland.  I am deeply concerned that, having invested so much political capital in Europe to protect our corporation tax rate, we have lost sight of other key pillars of what investors are looking at when they are thinking about entering, or expanding in the Irish market.<\/p> <p>Clearly, our planning process, and within that our court system, have proven a total and absolute barrier to economic development.  This is not something that can be simply shrugged off or seen as an isolated case.  When a major brand like Apple takes a decision like this, it resonates in boardrooms right across corporate America and, I am sure, further afield.  We are constantly competing with other similar-sized and larger countries who seek to emulate our model, and the investment community needs to see this Government respond in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p>There are many lessons which must be learned from the Apple case that, in my view, are not as complex as perhaps some seem to make out.  The most important one is time.  It took six months for Galway County Council to approve planning for the data centre, which in my mind does not seem an unreasonable length of time for a project of this magnitude.  However, what happened after that is deeply disappointing.  It took a full 12 months from the appeal of Galway County Council's decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be determined, and that appeal upheld the council's planning approval.  It then took 14 months from that decision, which was challenged before the High Court in the Commercial Court, which is supposed to be a fast-tracked court for Mr. Justice McDermott to deliver a judgment, which again upheld the original planning approval.  It took a further seven months after that decision for the Supreme Court to decide only that it was willing to hear an appeal.<\/p> <p>This means that, in total, from the formal planning application to the Supreme Court decision to admit the appeal a few days ago, a total of three years and three months have elapsed.  Quite frankly, this is some kind of a sick joke of a system for an economic development of this nature, and I do not use that language lightly.  There has been a lot of talk about the objectors and their vested interests or otherwise, but in my view that deflects from the central issue.  One of the largest brands in the world, which employs 5,500 people here, chose Ireland for a further almost &euro;1 billion investment and our planning and legal system, despite upholding that everything which Apple was intending to do was completely lawful, took three years and three months to deliver its decision, with a further one potentially pending if Apple had decided to stick around.<\/p> <p>I do not blame Apple.  Why would any business stick around when faced with another 12, if not 18, months after an almost three and half year debacle?  I recognise that the Government has announced changes so that major infrastructure projects will go through An Bord Plean&aacute;la first, but that body took one year in the Apple case, whereas the council actually took six months.  I equally recognise the announcement by the President of the High Court, in a practice direction issued in February this year, that Mr. Justice Barniville is specially assigned to exclusively deal with all applications for permission to challenge decisions concerning strategic infrastructure developments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is welcome, but I question whether it goes far enough.  If a person challenges what is thought to be a quicker decision made by this new specially assigned court, what will stop the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court causing further delays, only later to uphold the original decision when the investment might be gone?<\/p><p>In the United States it is common in certain state courts, including appeal courts, for specific deadlines to be imposed for a court to deliver a judgment.  Why can a similar system not be introduced here for certain cases?  Similarly, if all major infrastructure projects are to be brought directly before An Bord Plean&aacute;la why can we not mandate specific maximum timelines and then impose similar timelines for the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court?  The global investment community needs to know that we want its big capital investment projects in this country and that the shambles with Apple will never be repeated.  I am deeply concerned that this message has not been conveyed.  We must have more innovative thinking that will offer investors absolute certainty that this country remains open for business.<\/p><p>I wish to congratulate our two new Members, Senators Marshall and Lawlor.

He captured not only the realities and sometimes the cruelties of existence in times of pressure but also the passion for life and the extraordinarily transcendent power of the imagination.  He celebrates what it is to be able to tell one's stories in difficult circumstances.

The Irish Society for Colitis and Crohn's Disease had a meeting with the Minister for Health six months ago to seek a commitment from him to appoint 14 additional inflammatory bowel disease expert nurses to assist patients in the better management of their condition and to keep them out of hospital.  A statement was made by the HSE, and by the Minister to the best of my recollection, in November last year that 120 additional advanced nurse practitioners would be appointed.  Some of those nurses have been appointed, but to different disciplines.<\/p> <p>I ask the House to support me and the Irish Society for Colitis and Crohn's Disease in calling for the appointment of 14 additional inflammatory bowel disease nurses to help the 20,000 IBD patients across the country to manage their conditions better and to keep them out of hospital.  Many Members of the House will be familiar with this debilitating condition which can keep people out of work for a long time and affects families and relationships.  This is a no-brainer.  It makes vast economic sense.  For a small investment we can engage double the current number of inflammatory bowel disease nurses and ensure there is a proper regional spread across the country.  It would be timely, in advance of the celebration of World IBD Day next Saturday, if the Minister would make a statement committing to doubling the number of IBD nurses in the country to assist the growing number of patients with IBD. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#H01200","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I take serious exception to Senator Rose Conway-Walsh's comments about the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is one of the most sincere, hard-working politicians this country has ever had.

We have had many debates on this and we have heard a lot of commentary about the loss of young people to the agriculture industry.  There is an anomaly in the training of young farmers.  The qualification a trained farmer receives is known as a green cert and this can be achieved in two different ways, either by attending agricultural college for a full-time course or on a part-time basis through courses mainly run by Teagasc.  A person, however, cannot do the part-time course if he or she is under the age of 23.  This needs to be raised with the Minister and the Minister needs to look at it very closely.  A young man or woman is an integral part of the operation of a small family farm holding in Ireland and their parents cannot afford or acquire labour to replace them while they are away on a full-time course.  If it is good enough to do the course on a part-time basis after the age of 23, I do not see why it cannot be done after the leaving cert.<\/p> <p>One case came to my attention recently.  A father is in ill health and his son wished to do the training but, because he is only 19, he cannot do it part time and must wait until he is 23.  The elephant in the room is that most, if not all, farm payments due to that business are dependent on him having the qualification.  The farm will not be able to draw down the payments it needs for five years.  I cannot see the difference between doing the course at 18 or 23 on a part-time basis, in the evenings in winter, for example.

I mentioned it briefly during our debate on Europe Day last week.  I want to bring to the attention of the House the fact that there have been systematic attacks on different layers of Catalonian society.  To date, nine politicians have been jailed.  There are no dates for trial.  Effectively, they are being interned.  A total of 900 mayors are being investigated for facilitating the referendum last year.  Former officials of the Catalan Government have been charged with misuse of funds simply for inviting people - diplomats - to visit Catalonia, which is something that has gone on for years.  Civil rights groups are under attack for giving out information.  For handing out leaflets, they have been charged with hate speech and hate crimes.  Teachers are being prosecuted for hate crimes.  Their crime was to facilitate debate in schools.  Simply to facilitate a debate is now a crime in Catalonia.  The firemen who courageously defended people when they were voting are being charged.  They were standing in the way of police who were trying to batter people at the time.  They are being charged with hate crimes.  The colour yellow has effectively been banned in Catalonia.  At the Copa del Rey final involving Barcelona a few weeks ago, yellow T-shirts - no slogans just yellow in colour - were taken off the people wearing them.  The speaker of the Catalonian Parliament has been arrested for facilitating a debate in the Chamber.  What we have, right here in Europe, is effectively the most horrendous authoritarian clampdown on civil rights, even on freedom of speech.<\/p> <p>I wish to request a debate on this matter.  One does not have to be in favour of Catalan independence - I certainly am and I make no apologies for it - to recognise that something fundamentally wrong is happening in Catalonia right now.  There is an horrendous clampdown on civil rights.  I do not think any of us should be willing to countenance the wall of silence that has been built up in respect of this matter.

After 20 years, we wanted to renew the agreement.  Many issues were raised, such as the undocumented Irish and looking for answers to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, on which we feel there are not enough answers.  There is one aspect which I feel we have allowed to happen.  Last weekend in Donegal, a hotel was going to have a function to celebrate the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle but it cannot now do so because thugs who call themselves republicans rang up and intimidated the hotel in order to stop the function going ahead.

As we all know, 209 cases of cancer were diagnosed where results should have been escalated.  Sadly, 18 of those poor patients have passed on.  I want to flag a patient, Jacinta Doyle, who is a Wexford lady and a mother of two.  She had a smear in 2011 and no issues were raised with that smear, but in 2012 she was diagnosed with cancer when she went to her GP complaining of back pain.  In fact, she had to pay for a private scan herself in order to obtain a diagnosis.  My concern regarding to the whole controversy is the apparent fire-fighting approach adopted by the HSE and CervicalCheck.  This lady spent 12 days trying to get answers on where she should go next.  She rang the helpline on 28 April and 3 May.  On 7 May, she contacted the helpline via Facebook.  It was only on 10 May that she was informed that her original smear was tested in the US and that the lab is no longer used.<\/p> <p>The constant drip feeding of information is not good enough.  It is only in the past few days that GPs got clear notification on how to offer free smears to patients.  Said notification indicates that if a patient has a medical card, the GP can fill out a special claim, through a special type consultation, STC, form, and put the card number on it.  For private patients who do not have medical cards, GPs can put those people's PPS numbers on the special claim forms.  I understand this may be a breach of data protection and the HSE has yet to clarify this.  It is time that CervicalCheck redoubled its efforts to try to allay the fears of the women of Ireland.<\/p> <p>I understand that the Scally inquiry is under way, but cold clinical words were used when discussing what CervicalCheck saw as a potential scandal and this was wrong.  Confidence in the programme has been undermined.  As a GP, it is my duty to encourage women to continue to attend for screening and to come to me and other GPs throughout the country with any concerns or symptoms they may have.  It is important to recognise, despite the fiasco, that over the past ten years, 80% of eligible women have attended for their scheduled smears and this has led to a progressive reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  These numbers speak for themselves and we should use our platform here in the Seanad to encourage women to continue with the screening process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#K00700","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that No. 12 on the Order Paper be taken before No. 1.

The expert review of the Mental Health Act recommended this be addressed without delay, and this is what I am doing today.  The legislation is about rights and stating mental health should be treated with the same set of principles as physical health.  It is about young people having rights over their own mental healthcare.  It is about the stigmatising mental health.

It was marvellous.<\/p><p>The Queen, her gracious majesty by God-ordained, is three times directly descended from Brian Boru, once from Hugh O'Neill, rebel Earl of Tyrone, and Prince Harry is also a descendent of the Roches of Cork.  We have, therefore, a direct Irish interest in the royal wedding.  It is a bit of fun, it is pageantry, it is glam, people love it.  It is a real soap opera.  People are going to be on tenterhooks to see if daddy turns up or if he will be doing another gig with the paparazzi.  It is great fun. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#K00900","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Do you have an invitation, Senator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#L00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I am afraid I have not.

In particular, on the \"Claire Byrne Live\" show on Monday night, I completely respect that people disagree on the issue with regard to the referendum.  That is to be absolutely expected.  There would be something wrong if people did not disagree.  It has been a difficult issue for this country to discuss for many years.<\/p> <p>However, the Irish people were the real losers in that debate.  The atmosphere was aggressive, disrespectful and somewhat demeaning to be a part of.  To have the memory of a woman like Ms Savita Halappanavar responded to by jeering and heckling when her name was mentioned, regardless of the context, was a new low in the debate.  I hope that other programmes learn from this.<\/p> <p>I understand that a lot of the time in this debate, it is an echo chamber, as people have their minds made up.  On \"Claire Byrne Live\" a lot of people were there with fully formed views and that has to be respected on all sides.  Equally, there were people watching at home who needed to access information that really was not getting out.  This may be considered good TV but for me it was appalling.  If one was willing to be aggressive in one's approach there was more airtime and I think that is regrettable.<\/p> <p>As regards the Down's syndrome point, which is a point that Senator McFadden has made very well, the committee categorically decided and recommended that disability would not be a ground for termination in this country.  The legislation has wholeheartedly taken on our recommendation in that regard.  For the \"No\" side of the campaign to insist on using Down's syndrome babies is really appalling.  I understand the Down's syndrome association has been very upset about this.  I have to categorically state as the former Chair of that committee, that Down's syndrome is not something that was ever envisaged as such a ground, and there are many of the committee members who would be extremely uncomfortable with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#L00700","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  Can I thank the 14 Members of the House for their contributions to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Can I begin on my own behalf, as Leader of the House, with Senators Conway-Walsh, Higgins and Nash, in paying tribute to the memory of the late Tom Murphy, the playwright who passed away.  As Senator Nash rightly said, he was a playwright who held up a mirror up to the nation.  In his work he very ably and sometimes controversially portrayed a different type of Ireland to what some people might have expected to have seen on the stage.<\/p> <p>As the youngest of ten children, all of his siblings emigrated and that may have had a bearing on his work and an influence on him.  He was, as has already been said here today, a playwright who was influenced by his life.  Emigration and displacement were part of what he has written.  It is a testimony to him that the President, Michael D. Higgins, who paid tribute to him this morning and earlier presented an award to him, described him as the playwright of the emigrant, whose contribution to Irish theatre has been immense and unique.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the House can I offer our sympathies to his family.  Ar Dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of CAMHS.  Obviously the issue of CAMHS waiting times is a challenge.  There are, as Senator Ardagh is aware, acknowledged difficulties in the recruitment and retention of specialist CAMHS staff around consultant psychiatry.  Recruitment is continuing, both internationally and locally.  In the recent budget, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Daly, secured &euro;35 million for new mental health initiatives and I think what he is trying to do, which is very important, is to create more appropriate referral system, whereby people do not have to be automatically seen by a psychiatrist.  What he is talking about here is more levels of intervention at a lower level. He is right.  Everybody has to be seen by a consultant psychiatrist.  However, in saying that this is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The Government is committed to doing that.  We have seen that 114 assistant psychologists and 18 psychologists posts have just been filled in the counselling and primary care service, which will relieve pressure in specialist CAMHS.  It is important, and I accept the point made by Senator Ardagh, that young people especially, who are particularly vulnerable who need intervention and who need assistance, receive same in a timely manner.  I concur with the Senator's remarks.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh also referred to the issue of housing.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, through Rebuilding Ireland is very committed to increasing the housing stock, and to the provision of both social and affordable housing and building in general.  The point the Senator made in respect of the issue of the number of homes available for long-term letting is one that needs to be addressed urgently and that is why Government is addressing this through a compendium of measures.<\/p> <p>The big issue is that there are people who were in the long-term rental market as landlords and have decided to get out of it.  In some cases it is to sell and in other cases it is because Airbnb is easier for them.  We need to get that balance right.  Some people come in here every day shouting about X and others will look to have Y defended.  There is a balance to be struck and I agree with the Senator on that point.  I will ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House again in regard to this matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Lawless made a very important point about Apple and we discussed it last week on the Order of Business.  The Senator is right.  The decision of Apple has a repercussion that we may not feel in the short term, but in the medium and long term it may well send a message to international investors that Ireland is not a place to locate.  We have an obligation now as a Government and as Members of this House to sell the message through the IDA and through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, under Deputy Humphreys, that we are open for business.  That is why the Government took decisions on strategic infrastructure development whereby one has fast-track planning.  We had this debate last week.  It is about ensuring that we get a balance on the rights of the person to object and the rights of the company to develop.  The Senator is correct in that regard.  I commend the Senator for the work he is doing in promoting Ireland across the United States.<\/p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh, McFadden and Noone made reference indirectly and directly to the issue of health as regards the cervical cancer issue and the eighth amendment, which are not linked.  I do not want to pick a row on the Order of Business on a very important sensitive matter.  I appreciate that Senator Conway-Walsh has left to attend the health committee.  It is because of the interventions of this morning, that there is a need to take this issue out of the political arena.  We have an independent statutory inquiry established under Professor Scally.  I remind Members who may not agree with my next couple of remarks to read his memo which I referenced here yesterday.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an independent, eminent scholar heading up an inquiry and he expressed concern about the \"fevered atmosphere\" around the issue.  In correspondence he said he was making progress in the investigation but expressed concern that the current fevered atmosphere is posing some problems.  I chaired the Joint Committee on Health for five years and, as I have said here every day, when an eminent scholar like this is leading an investigation and is saying that people and officials are being distracted from the work he is undertaking because they need to appear before Oireachtas committees, we have to ask what we want to get.  Do we want to have an independent inquiry which will get to the bottom of all this or do we want to have a three-ring circus which ends up in nothing happening?  That is a choice.  We can leave it in the political arena and have people stepping in and stepping out on \"Prime Time\", \"Claire Byrne Live\" and \"The Tonight Show\".  What I have said from the beginning of this awful period is that we have to have accountability.  People must be held to account on the basis of all of the facts being made available.  <\/p><p>The overarching concern must be support for the women who have been let down by the system.  That is why last Friday, the Government announced a series of measures were being put in place.  As Senator Swanick also said, we have a duty to restore confidence in the cancer screening programme and the HPV vaccination because vaccination and screening work.  That is what we must be about.  We can politicise the issue if Members want but I want to see the women and their families supported, the system rectified, confidence in the cancer screening programme restored and those who have done wrong held to account based upon the full facts.  I certainly hope that we will not see people using committees of these Houses to politicise this issue because it is not about that.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins raised the issue of online manipulation and fake accounts.  She made a very good point in that regard.  There is more work to be done and I hope that we can work collectively to ensure that happens.  I commend Senator Nash for his contribution with regard to inflammatory bowel disease.  The points he made are well supported.  Government has committed to funding a variety of posts through the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  I do not have all the information to hand but I will certainly be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.<\/p><p>Senators McFadden and Noone also raised the issue of the referendum with regard to posters and broadcasting of debates.  The Oireachtas committee on which Senator Gavan, Senator Noone and I sat expressly prohibited and outlawed the issue of disability as part of our report, which is now before the people in a referendum.  People have a right to have different viewpoints from one another's.  That is called democracy.  However, the use of young adults or young children on a poster is both unfair and is wrong.  These are people who have a life, who have an opinion and who have feelings.  They are affected by the posters and they speak about them.  They have spoken to me about them.  We are letting them down in this case.<\/p><p>I am all in favour of the right to have a debate in a referendum campaign.  If people vote \"No\", as some will choose to, that will be their decision and I accept that, but please let us not go into the arena and the space in which we use people for political gain in the context of this referendum.  The point made by Senator Noone regarding the format of the debate, which we also discussed yesterday, is one which I hope the Referendum Commission can take up with the relevant broadcasters because it was unedifying.  Whether it was the \"Yes\" voters or the \"No\" voters in the audience last Monday night, the middle ground got lost in the debate.  It was not about the people on one side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#L00800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Both sides were bad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#M00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Both sides-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#M00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Except for Dr. Peter Boylan and Deputy Mary Lou McDonald who were terrific.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#M00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I made my remarks on that on yesterday's Order of Business and it has been well documented.

To quote from his speech this morning, he has, \"consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin-Monaghan atrocities.\"  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear on that.  I thank Senator Boyhan for his remarks.  The Government is not opposing the Private Members' motion this afternoon, as the Senator knows, and we will have that debate later on.  Again, it is important that we ascertain all of the facts and that justice prevails at all times.<\/p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the very important issue of home care packages in Mayo and the length of waiting times.  The pertinent point she makes is that the HSE has the information and that people should not have to wait an inordinate length of time for funding or for a place to be allocated because it has ramifications in that there are people in beds in hospitals who are depriving other people of access to the system when they could be at home or in a transition or step-down facility.  The point the Senator makes is very valid.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of Catalonia.  There was a motion before the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the name of Senator Gavan's party leader.  It is under review.  On the point he makes on the new arrangement now in place in Catalonia, as I said earlier it is important that people are allowed to express a different viewpoint, to protest in a peaceful democratic manner and to have their voice heard.  I have always been supportive of that.  I hope the issue in Catalonia is resolved.  I know Mr. Puigdemont is not under arrest.  I think he is still in Germany.

This amendment, which I will quote to ensure there is no ambiguity, is to section 17, and reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>On page 17, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;(1) The District Court may try summarily a person or body corporate charged with a summary or indictable offence under this Act if&mdash;(a) the Court is of opinion that the facts proved or alleged constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily,<br \/><br \/>(b) the accused, on being informed by the Court of his, her or its right to be tried with a jury, does not object to being tried summarily, and <br \/><br \/>(c) the Director of Public Prosecutions consents to the accused being tried summarily for the offence.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>The aim of this amendment is a simple one.  It is to ensure that if an accused is prosecuted for an offence under this Act, the accused has the option to elect for a jury trial.  As the Bill stands, if a person or body corporate is prosecuted for an offence under this Act on a summary basis, in other words, where the maximum custodial sentence is 14 months, that criminal trial would be heard before a District Court judge.<\/p><p>Many people may say the offences will have lesser penalties and that this is an efficient way for a crime to be prosecuted.  It is already the case that for certain theft and fraud offences an accused can elect to have their trial heard by a jury even when prosecuted on a summary basis.  I cannot see how offences prosecuted under a corruption Act are any less consequential than theft and fraud offences.<\/p><p>I recognise that the Minister wishes to have this Bill passed by June.  I want to facilitate that but when it comes to a person's liberty and ensuring they receive a fair trial, we have to be extremely careful that in our collective desire to ensure no person is above the law, we do not lose sight of due process.

As has been said, the amendment relates to section 17 of the Bill to provide for a right of election for an accused to be tried summarily.  It is a similar approach to that which is being taken in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951 and section 53 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, but the key difference is that the provisions in those Acts relate to offences that are specified in various items of legislation to be triable on indictment only.  The provision, therefore, gives jurisdiction to the District Court to try summarily what would otherwise have been an indictable offence and therefore subject to a trial by jury.<\/p><p>The amendment proposed by Senator Boyhan does not sit neatly with the provisions of this Bill as currently constructed.  It already provided for proceedings to be tried summarily or on indictment.  This approach to the construction of offences, which is known as a hybrid offence, has been widely used in the Statute Book for the past decade or more.  It appears what Senator Boyhan wishes to achieve, supported by Senator Norris, is that an accused would have a right to object to being tried summarily in a given case in which instance the DPP would make a decision on whether to try the accused for the offence on indictment.<\/p><p>While I appreciate the importance of trial by jury in our legal system, it has long been accepted that minor offences can and should be tried in the absence of a jury.  For practical reasons, and often for other reasons, it would be an offence of a more minor nature that would be accepted by the prosecution pre-trial.  The important thing is to balance the rights of the accused persons with the effective and efficient administration of justice.  The Constitution provides only that minor offences be tried summarily in the absence of a jury.<\/p><p>In drafting the Bill I have given careful consideration to the construction of offences and I am happy that the approach in the Bill is the best way forward.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions elects to try an offence summarily, the court must still accept jurisdiction and will only do so if the offence is a minor offence.  The Supreme Court, in the case of Reade <i>v.<\/i>Reilly, has expressed the clear view that an election by the DPP to try a case summarily does not bind the District Court to do so and explained that this was to ensure that the rights of an accused to a trial by jury for a non-minor offence would not be unduly interfered with.<\/p><p>As I mentioned previously, the provisions in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951 and in section 53 of the Criminal Justice (Fraud and Theft Offences) Act 2001 relate to indictable offences only, not hybrid offences as we have provided for in this Bill.  Even in the wording of the amendment as proposed, it is clear that it does not make sense in the context of what in effect is a hybrid offence.  For example, the amendment states that the District Court may try summarily a person or body corporate charged with a summary or indictable offence, essentially providing that a summary offence may be tried summarily, which seems to be an obvious statement of fact.<\/p><p>I see where the Deputy is coming from but having regard to the construct of the Bill, I am not prepared to accept his amendment because the consequences have not been fully considered.  I know Senators feel strongly about it.

I am supporting the Bill.  I am reminded of what the Taoiseach said in his only address to this House.  He spoke of our role and that he wished to see more legislation.  We are redundant if we do not deal with this.  There is very little legislation coming through this House at the moment - that unfortunately is the way the pipeline is.  The Taoiseach appealed to us to actively and rigorously pursue and scrutinise legislation.  That is the primary function of this House.  <\/p><p>Senator Leyden has now left the Chamber, having made his statement that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Bill but would not be supporting the amendment or amendments - I could not quite understand.  He has not heard us speak.  In a democracy I like to hear what people have to say before I make a call on something.  I have spoken to Fianna F&aacute;il people myself.  While it might not have been dealt with in the D&aacute;il, not everything happens in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, made that point about the previous amendment.  There are some enlightened people in here who have a different view on things.  We saw it differently.  <\/p><p>I am not ruling out Fianna F&aacute;il supporting the next one based on my engagement and conversation.  I took the trouble to send this to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin this morning before I left here.  I am sorry I did not send it earlier.  Perhaps I should have used some more of my lobbying skills to meet him and some other officials within the party earlier.  Anyway, I will make my case here and try to convince people.  Politicians cannot be above the law.  It is that simple.  I discussed this issue after the last time this Bill was debated in this House.  I thought about it and sought advice.  We need to be very clear.  I am interested to hear what the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has to say.  He did say that he would reflect on it and he may read something into the record today that I would be interested to study.  The amendment I have moved pertains to section 17(4).  I will read it out for clarity.  It proposes, on page 18, between lines 16 and 22, to delete the following: <\/p><blockquote>other than an office as&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(ii) a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(iii) a member of the European Parliament who is such a member by virtue of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, or<br \/><br \/>(iv) a member of a local authority.<\/blockquote> <p>I appreciate there may be divided views in this House and there may even be divided constitutional and legal views and opinions.  It is important, however, that this matter is debated.  As the Bill stands, there is a provision for a court - after a person has been convicted on indictment and in addition to any custodial or any non-custodial sentence issued - &quot;to make an order prohibiting the person from seeking to hold or occupy any office, position or employment as an Irish official&quot;.  An &quot;Irish official&quot; is defined in section 2 of the Bill as including:<\/p><blockquote>(d) the Attorney General,<br \/><br \/>(e) the Comptroller and Auditor General,<br \/><br \/>(f) the Director of Public Prosecutions,<br \/><br \/>(g) a judge of a court in the State,<br \/><br \/>(h) an arbitrator, including any member of an arbitral board, panel or tribunal, in arbitral proceedings governed by the law of the State,<br \/><br \/>(i) a member of a jury in court proceedings (whether civil or criminal) in the State or in an inquest held under the Coroners Act 1962,<br \/><br \/>(j) an officer, director, employee or member of an Irish public body (including a member of a local authority),<br \/><br \/>(k) any other office holder appointed under an enactment who is remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and who is independent in the performance of the functions of that office, or<br \/><br \/>(l) any other person employed by or acting for or on behalf of the public administration of the State. <\/blockquote> <p>In Schedule 1 to the Bill, there is an exhaustive list of who is included in the definition of &quot;an Irish public body&quot;.  It includes:<\/p><blockquote>(a) a Department of State, including, as respects any particular Department of State, any office or body not otherwise standing specified in or under this Schedule in relation to which functions are vested in the Minister of the Government having charge of that Department of State;<br \/><br \/>(b) the Office of the President;<br \/><br \/>(c) the Office of the T&aacute;naiste;<br \/><br \/>(d) the Office of the Attorney General;<br \/><br \/>(e) the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General;<br \/><br \/>(f) the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions;<br \/><br \/>(g) the Office of the Ombudsman;<br \/><br \/>(h) the Houses of the Oireachtas Service;<br \/><br \/>(i) the Courts Service;<br \/><br \/>(j) a local authority;<br \/><br \/>(k) the Health Service Executive;<br \/><br \/>(l) the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<br \/><br \/>(m) the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate;<br \/><br \/>(n) the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission;<br \/><br \/>(o) the Policing Authority;<br \/><br \/>(p) the Criminal Assets Bureau;<br \/><br \/>(q) the National Asset Management Agency;<br \/><br \/>(r) the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland;<br \/><br \/>(s) the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission;<br \/><br \/>(t) an Bord Plean&aacute;la;<br \/><br \/>(u) the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<\/blockquote> <p>I want to be specific in reading this.  It is important that we set the record right here and that we do not have any distortion or misunderstanding when we leave here and suddenly ask what are we talking about.  There are only three amendments and as there is time for this business, I do not see why we should not be specific and set out our case.  The Schedule continues by listing:<\/p><blockquote>(v) a body, organisation or group established---(i) by or under any enactment (other than the Companies Act 2014), or<br \/><br \/>(ii) under the Companies Act 2014, in pursuance of powers conferred by or under another enactment, and financed wholly or partly by means of moneys provided, or loans made or guaranteed, by a Minister of the Government or the issue of shares held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government;(w) a company a majority of the shares in which are held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government;<br \/><br \/>(x) any other body, organisation or group appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government.<\/blockquote> <p>Under section 17(5)(a), all these people, the categories of whom are vast in nature, if convicted of an offence could be prevented from retaining their position or any other position in any of the above bodies or public bodies:<\/p><blockquote>if the court is satisfied that to do so is&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) in the interests of justice, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) in the interests of maintaining or restoring public confidence in the public administration of the State.<\/blockquote> <p>It is important that these full provisions be read into the record because, crucially, under section 17(4)(c), the persons it does not include are:<\/p><blockquote>(i) a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(ii) a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(iii) a member of the European Parliament who is such a member by virtue of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, or<br \/><br \/>(iv) a member of a local authority.<\/blockquote> <p>How can we say that every person is treated equally under the law if, under the broad definition I have outlined today, effectively a secretary who is convicted for a corrupt offence could see him or herself prevented for up to ten years for working in any public office.  A politician, however, convicted for that same offence could put himself or herself up for election.  I have heard the arguments about constitutional conflict and around the Constitution.  The public do not always know what politicians are about.  I do not think we can put it down to there being constitutional issues in respect of this issue.  If there are, I want to hear them and I want to hear them here today.  <\/p><p>If the Minister is constrained by the advice from the Attorney General - as he may say to us, I do not know, and I will not pre-empt what he might say - then I would like to hear what the constitutional constraints are.  Equally, if it is the Attorney General's advice that including elected persons within the definition of the public official is unconstitutional, then I think we should at least have a discussion about amending the Constitution.  I await the Minister's response and I thank the Members for indulging me in that rather long introduction.  However, it was important to put it right for the record of the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#R00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I raised this matter first on Second Stage and I spoke to my colleague and friend, Senator Boyhan, about it and got his support for an amendment.

He said:<\/p><blockquote>Senators Norris and Boyhan stated that public representatives will not be subject to the offences or penalties under this Bill.  That is not accurate.  Under the Bill, the only penalty that does not apply to public representatives is the prohibition to seek another office in the future.  I am happy to debate the detail of this measure in the context of an amendment on Committee Stage. <\/blockquote><p>We put such an amendment down.  <br\/><br\/>I should say that I spoke to my assistant, who is absolutely wonderful, and gave her a copy of the Bill which I had marked up from page 18, to delete everything from line 16 after &quot;as an Irish official&quot; down to line 23. <br\/><br\/>However, somehow the amendment that was put down was as follows: &quot;In page 19, to delete lines 17 to 23&quot;.  There was a mistake from my office in the page number stated and the amendment would not make sense if it related to page 19.  I do not know what happened.  I put my amendment in immediately and arguably it should have been the first to be listed, although I am very happy for Senator Boyhan to take up the matter. <br\/><br\/>We do need a situation where, as Senator Boyhan said, politicians are not above the law.  Do we really want people in the D&aacute;il or Seanad who have been convicted of corruption?  Do we want corrupt politicians in this country?  The public is already very suspicious of politicians who have the lowest levels of trust among the public with the exception, I am glad to say, of journalists whose rating is even lower, and so they should be.  We already have evidence from the other House of people against whom grave suspicions have been raised by various tribunals, who were elected and, indeed top the poll, because they are very good constituency workers.  There was no criminal finding but it does suggest that such a finding could be made against a public official.<br\/><br\/>I remember former Ministers being convicted in the courts and I do not think that they are the kind of people we want in Parliament.  I really do not.  Does the Minister want these sorts of people in the D&aacute;il or Seanad?  Do we want as Members people who have been convicted of corrupt offences?  On matters such as the Constitution and democracy, the argument holds equally well for all the other people who are excluded, it does not operate only for politicians.  This Bill, as it stands, is making a special case for politicians.  I would also be interested to know what the Fianna F&aacute;il position is and whether it will support this amendment.  I put it to my friends and colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il that they, like everyone else, will be against corruption in Irish public life.  Do they want a situation where we are institutionalising it and allow politicians alone to be excluded from the penalties in this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#R00400","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>This is a fascinating debate and is a fascinating issue to tease out.  There is no doubting the sincerity with which Senator Boyhan and his colleagues have brought forward this amendment.  Senator Boyhan is correct that in this House, he is someone who engages, who listens, seeks views and guidance and is not dogmatic in the views or proposals he puts forward.<\/p> <p>Having listened to the debate, Sinn F&eacute;in also has concerns on the constitutionality of this amendment.  We may not have to die on a ditch at this point and we can have the opportunity now to listen to the various views of Members and the Minister.  <\/p> <p>There is a fundamental issue where a culture has prevailed in the politics of this State where individuals are regarded as being all right and a bit of a rogue.  There is also a broader question of how we as a society think that it is okay to elect someone to political office and public life in that case.  I agree with much of what the Senator said.  It is not the case that all the people who found themselves in those political positions have not been convicted, but they were in the political positions by dint of the people who elected them.  Other legislation and aspects of our politics can be examined in the context of how we ensure that the controversies which have bedevilled this State, in terms of white collar crime and corruption, can be challenged in broader society.  People would then know that there was some transparency around candidates' records or their pasts when they go forward.  I think the Senator is on shaky ground on this and that there are questions regarding the constitutionality of such an amendment.  At this stage, I am reluctant to support the amendment without having teased those matters out for a later stage.  I am keen to hear the Minister's thoughts and those of colleagues.  <\/p> <p>I think it is reasonable that if any Member of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament was found guilty by a court of law under this Act that he or she would be disbarred from public office for ten years, and I would suggest that in some cases, ten years would not be enough.  I just do not know if we are that far yet but maybe with the Minister's co-operation and that of others we can navigate a way through this which gets the right amendment and goes beyond rhetoric to also filter into society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#S00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I am fascinated by this debate.  I remember in the mid-1990s, having this very discussion as a politics student in UCD when the former Member of this House, Senator Maurice Manning, lectured in that Department.  It was before any of what we know now had emerged, it would have been in 1993 or 1994.  The first time I was ever in the Seanad Chamber was when I visited with my class with Maurice Manning.<\/p> <p>Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I am conflicted in that it is a very good amendment in what it seeks to achieve but one can also have miscarriages of justice.  There could be a situation where people were convicted of corruption and ten years later, they might be able to prove their innocence and in the meantime, they had been denied the opportunity of seeking a mandate from their constituents.  <\/p> <p>Democracy is something that we in this country treasure.  It is a difficult matter if the people choose to give someone a mandate.  One might argue that a person having been convicted of corruption should be banned for life, but on the other hand, if one truly believes in democracy, the democratic process and universal suffrage, who am I to say that the person they vote for is not suitable?  I might believe that but the people who vote for this person may not agree.  Sometimes we have to accept the will of the people.  On Friday week, whatever the result, we as politicians will respect and accept the will of the people.<\/p> <p>A better way to deal with this issue would be for the people who abhor corruption to put candidates up against people who have been found to have been corrupt and for the political system not to select candidates who are found to be corrupt.  There is nothing to stop people from standing as an Independent but they should not stand as a candidate from a registered political party.  <\/p> <p>I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The motivation behind the amendment is 100% on the ball, but we have to consider the democratic process, the secrecy of the ballot box, the notion of respecting democracy and ultimately accepting - not necessarily respecting - a mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#S00300","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Boyhan and Norris for coming back to this issue, which was referred to at an earlier Stage.  The amendment relates to the provision in section 17(4)(c) where a court in imposing a sentence on a person for an offence under the Act may make an order which will in essence prohibit that person from seeking to hold or occupy any office, position or employment as an Irish official for up to ten years.<\/p><p>I agree with much of what has been said.  It is entirely reasonable to seek to exclude from public office somebody found guilty of corruption.  The United Nations Convention against Corruption requires Ireland to give due consideration to such a measure.  The penalty may be imposed where a court is satisfied as to a number of things.  It is in the interests of justice and in the interests of restoring public confidence in the public administration of the State.  However, it is the court that must be satisfied.<\/p><p>The Bill as it stands contains a number of exceptions.  It states that nobody should be prohibited from seeking office as a Deputy, Senator, Member of the European Parliament or member of a local authority.  I understand Senators Boyhan and Norris would like to remove these exceptions.  There are sound constitutional reasons for having these exceptions.  I refer to Article 16.1 of the Constitution which states:<\/p><blockquote>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/blockquote> <p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann is dealt with in Article 18.2 which states:<\/p><blockquote>A person to be eligible for membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann must be eligible to become a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/blockquote> <p>There is a direct relationship and consequence.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Norris for going back to the earlier debate because it is important in considering where we are here.  I admit there was an element of confusion during the Second Stage debate, as Senator Norris acknowledges.  There was some confusion that the exceptions may only apply to politicians.  I want to be absolutely clear about the penalties under the Bill.  Included in the penalties are imprisonment; fines; and forfeiting the gift, advantage or consideration.  This, of course, applies to all citizens and all residents, including politicians.  Where the penalty is forfeiture of office, this can only apply to State employees, some of whom have been mentioned by Senator Boyhan - civil servants, public servants and elected politicians.  However, it will not apply to a small number of particular posts listed in the Bill as relevant Irish officials.  I will address this when discussing the next amendment, where it may be more relevant.<\/p><p>Where the penalty is prohibition from seeking public office for up to ten years, this again can apply to all Irish citizens and residents, including politicians.  Anybody with a corruption conviction can be prohibited from seeking employment as a public servant or civil servant, or from seeking a particular public post for a period of up to ten years.  The exception here is that nobody can be stopped from standing for election as a Deputy, Senator, MEP or member of a local authority.  It is not my intention here to unduly interfere with the electoral process.<\/p><p>I have been strongly advised that putting a prohibition order on somebody from seeking election would raise constitutional issues.  When the public are voting and a particular candidate has a conviction for corruption, this will obviously be a matter of public record.  The voter will make a choice on the basis of that record.  I do not accept that a serious corruption offence contrary to this legislation would be secret or would be conducted in a way that the electorate in any constituency - D&aacute;il or Seanad - would not be aware of this.  It would be a matter of public record and I have no doubt that the issue would be very much in play in an election campaign for the D&aacute;il, Seanad, European Parliament or whatever.<\/p><p>Where the penalty is forfeiture of office, it can and does apply to elected politicians - Deputies, Members of the European Parliament, members of a local authority and Senators.  The difficulty arises at the following or subsequent election at which that person may wish to seek an electoral mandate.  That is where the issue of the Constitution comes into play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#T00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I have heard what the Minister has said and I know the dilemma he faces.

I do not expect him to tell us things he cannot tell us; he is constrained in what he can say here.  However, everyone has to be held to account equally before the law whether they are citizens or politicians - I do not wish to draw any distinction between them.<\/p> <p>I am somewhat disappointed that so few Members are present; they may have other business to attend to.  I have heard what some of the Senators have said.  It is a sensitive issue and needs those from all parties and none to look at it, but the current situation is not good enough.  <\/p> <p>I draw Members attention to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service digest on the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill 2017.  The team in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service do a great job.  I do not know how many people use them, but I use them every day.  I rely on their independent validation and scrutiny of legislation.  It is a real tool to assist us in our work.<\/p> <p>An appendix at the end of the digest draws attention to the international anti-corruption conventions, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the Council of Europe Conventions on Corruption, Civil Law Convention on Corruption, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and a range of others.  It deals with the requirements in the conventions we have signed up to.<\/p> <p>When reading the digest, I wondered if we have forgotten about the recommendations from the report of the Mahon tribunal.  Have we learned anything from that tribunal?  Have we studied all the politicians who were hauled before that tribunal?  I accept there were ramifications for some and others for various reasons got off.  There were reviews and subsequently other decisions were made.  We spent a lot of money and saw many politicians appear before the Mahon tribunal over irregularities.<\/p> <p>Are these people suitable to be in public office?  The Minister is telling me it is acceptable to allow them to run in a general election and the people will know.  The people do not know a lot of things about a lot of politicians - including some who are in here.  They do not necessarily need to know.  There are people who have a considerable amount of money and can well afford to fund very successful advertising and propaganda campaigns to promote themselves.  All this gets a bit lost.

That is what I am taking away from it.  The Mahon tribunal discussed it.  We know what international best practice is.  I understand the Minister's dilemma and if he is telling me there are constitutional problems, we need to consider amending the Constitution.  If the Minister is stating we are constrained by the Constitution and if the Constitution is not serving us well, perhaps that is another constitutional amendment that should be on the list of proposals the Government might consider putting to the people.  I am not prepared to accept as a Member of the House, however, what the Minister proposes in this Bill.  If the Government comes back and says there is an anomaly or problem and that we are constrained by the Constitution, that is fair enough.  If it is the case, however, let us do something about it.  Let us identify it as a difficulty and do something.<\/p><p>I came to the House today to decide to call a vote on this but I am not going to.  I have heard what the Minister has said and I have heard the Senators who have spoken.  However, I ask that we come together.  This is an appeal to the House and to the D&aacute;il.  I ask that we look at this again on the next Stage and come up with something better than this.  This does not go far enough in my view but, ultimately, that is a matter for Members to decide.  The Members here will debate this issue in the coming days in the media.  I have no doubt about that.  Ultimately, we will have to make our own cases and say where we stand on this issue.  I will continue to be active on this.  I will take it to Government and to others.  I will put pen to paper this very day and write to a number of people, including the Taoiseach, to ask that this particular matter be given a focus.  As I understand it and having regard to what the Minister has said today, this does not go far enough.  Every Member of the Oireachtas of all parties and none must address this issue.  We must be frank and honest and put appropriate legislation in place.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reflect on this as he said he would with the previous amendment and bring this back on Report Stage to see what can be done.  In the meantime, I make the commitment that I will not be found wanting in lobbying and engaging with all political groupings in the Houses and in government to see if we can revisit this particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#T00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I am interested in the fact that the Minister quoted the Constitution and referred to incapacity by law.

I will outline the context arising from Committee Stage of the Bill.  These amendments have been grouped together as amendments Nos. 7, 9 and 10 relate to section 4 and provide for guiding principles for children.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are included in this group as the definitions referred to here also relate to terms used in the amendments proposed to section 4.  As amendments Nos. 11 and 12 deal with definitions they have also been added to this group.  I will start by discussing amendments Nos. 7 and 9, which are Government amendments, and amendment No. 10, which contains an alternative text proposed by Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson.<\/p> <p>Section 4 of the 2001 Act is entitled \"Best interests\" and covers both adults and children.  As it is proposed to remove the reference to best interests for adults, we must now reinsert the best interests provision for children in the 2001 Act.  In the amendments I am putting forward, I propose to delete the full text of section 4 and replace it with very similar provisions.  Deputy Browne had originally proposed to place this text in section 25 of the 2001 Act.  As section 25 only applies to involuntary patients and as the Deputy and I want this section to apply to all persons treated under the 2001 Act, we are suggesting instead that this text be added as a new section 4A of the 2001 Act, immediately after the new section entitled \"Guiding principles for adults\".<\/p> <p>While I had been inclined to accept and, indeed, add to Deputy Browne's text, legal concerns were raised with my officials by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC.  The OPC advised that some of the proposed provisions regarding children may impinge upon the constitutional rights of children and their parents and guardians.  It further advised that it is imperative that the Department be satisfied that these provisions correctly address the rights of the various relevant parties and they should dovetail appropriately with all applicable legislation.  In particular, the OPC asked that my officials confirm that they were satisfied that the proposed changes would not have any unintended negative effects on child-related legislation across other Departments.<\/p> <p>Although my Department supported the amendments from a policy point of view and was unable to identify any obvious negative impacts, I am obliged to pay appropriate attention to the legal concerns raised and may only propose amendments that we are satisfied will not have unintended legal or constitutional consequences.  The Government amendment to this section of the Bill, therefore, mirrors the current text of section 4 but proposes deleting references to the rights of the child to be heard having regard to his age and maturity.  Senators Ardagh, Swanick and Wilson have proposed amendments that are broader in scope but, given the legal concerns expressed, I propose that the House will agree to Government amendments Nos. 7 and 9 in order to allow the issues raised to be considered more fully.<\/p> <p>Regarding Government amendment No. 3 and amendment No. 4 in the names of Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson, the former relates to definitions in the 2001 Act.  The Government is proposing to add to the definitions in the Bill and to rephrase the definition of \"voluntary patient\".  Amendment No. 3 adds a definition for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and one for guiding principles in addition to the rephrased definition in respect of voluntary patients, also to be included in section 2 of the 2001 Act.  Amendment No. 4 differs only slightly from the Government's amendment with regard to the definition of \"guiding principles\".  We state that the guiding principles should be construed in accordance with section 4 of the 2001 Act, as my Department is now proposing, that is, guiding principles for adults but retaining best interests for children as per Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Amendment No. 4 retains a reference to guiding principles in respect of children, so the definition proposed includes a reference not just to section 4 of the Act but also the new proposed section 4A.  This is important because if the House decides to accept Government amendments Nos. 7 and 9, the logical consequence is that Senators should also agree to amendment No. 3.  On the other hand, if amendment No. 10 is accepted, it follows that Senators should also choose amendment No. 4 because the definition it contains flows directly from the text of amendment No. 10.  When the amendments are being put to the House, I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to bear this linkage in mind.<\/p> <p>The same text has been submitted by both the Government and Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson in amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  Both amendments can be accepted.<\/p> <p>Before I conclude and in case this gets lost in the technical discussion about accepting or rejecting numbered amendments, I remind Senators of the consequences of amending the definition of \"voluntary patient\".  There is no disagreement on this.  The definition in the 2001 Act is inadequate and must be amended to ensure that, in future, a voluntary patient is a person who formally consents to admission and treatment.  The reference to consent is missing from the current definition.  However, this change cannot proceed without any associated changes being introduced.  The suggested definition of \"voluntary patient\" would immediately result in some people being denied inpatient treatment.  Such persons would be those who lack capacity and who, therefore, cannot provide consent.  However, while they would need inpatient treatment, they would not be sufficiently mentally ill to warrant admission as involuntary patients.  As they lack capacity and cannot consent to treatment, they could not be voluntary patients but, equally, if they do not suffer from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the Act, they could also not be detained.  Such patients are sometimes referred to as the compliant incapacitated.  Before any new definition of \"voluntary patient\" which explicitly refers to consent commences, we must also include lawful measures which ensure that at no stage would the compliant incapacitated be denied treatment.<\/p> <p>In this regard, my Department is currently working on the deprivation of liberty safeguards that would be intended to allow persons without capacity to consent to be lawfully admitted to residential care and to psychiatric hospitals for treatment.  It is essential that the change of the definition of \"voluntary patient\" occurs simultaneously with the commencement of provisions relating to deprivation of liberty.  Draft heads of a Bill relating to deprivation of liberty safeguards were the subject of a recent public consultation and the views put forward during that consultation are now being considered by a working group based in the Department.  I expect that the deprivation of liberty Bill will be presented to the Oireachtas as soon a possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Finally, I will move on to amendments Nos. 11 and 12.  The Government and Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson have submitted amendments to sections 5 and 6 of the Bill, which seek to delete both sections.  At my meeting with Deputy Browne last week I explained that, while he had put forward a reasonable proposal to define consent for the purposes of a voluntary patient, the legal advice available to me is to the effect that consent is a feature of common law.  On that basis, including a specific definition in this Bill might have unintended consequences in other legislation which also deals with consent.  It is appropriate, therefore, that sections 5 and 6 be deleted and no replacement text is required here.<\/p><p>In summary, I appreciate this is complex and technical.  If the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are not withdrawing their amendments, I am prepared to withdraw the Government amendments Nos. 3, 7 and 9 and, as a result, I will not object to amendments Nos. 4 and 10, which are consequential to the Senators' proposals.<\/p><p>The second group of amendments are amendment Nos. 5 and 6 and if Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are not withdrawing their amendment No. 6, I am prepared to withdraw the Government amendment No. 5 and I will not object to amendment No. 6.

congratulate my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and the Deputy who has joined us on their work on this very important Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting the Fianna F&aacute;il amendments.  Our amendment is an amendment to section 15 of the principal Act.  It seeks to resolve an issue raised by a recent Court of Appeal ruling in the case of AB <i>v<\/i>. St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital.  The court ruled that allowing the extension of involuntary detention in a mental health facility by 12 months after a prior extension of six months was a violation of the rights of the patient.  The 12-month period was deemed too long to be ordered without a review.  The 2015 expert review of the Mental Health Act 2001, which was supported by the coalition Mental Health Reform, identified this issue and called for a reduction.  The expert review called for a maximum of nine months, but there is real concern that this would also not be constitutionally acceptable.  Patients deserve to have a right to review and to appeal their detention.  To say that a patient must be detained for 12 months without review is akin to an admission of defeat, especially when we are seeking to move to a community-based model in line with the A Vision for Change policy.  While some patients will need acute and even extended hospital care, this must be done with great care for the rights of the patient and always with a view to discharge and continued care and recovery in an outpatient setting.  I call on and urge all Members to support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#Z02700","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the proposed amendment.  It has been proposed as a direct result of the important judgment of the Court of Appeal given on 4 May 2018.  As Senator Warfield said, this judgment declared that renewal orders by mental health tribunals under section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001, which include both six-month and 12-month orders, breaches Article 40.4.1&deg; of the Constitution.  It is important to confirm that this declaration of unconstitutionality by the Court of Appeal stands suspended until 8 November 2018, which allows the necessary time to give full and proper consideration to this complex matter.<\/p> <p>While I fully accept that in proposing this amendment, the Senators are trying to be proactive in light of the judgment, I believe that we must first fully understand and agree what exactly is required of us as legislators, to ensure that we can comply with all aspects of the judgment and introduce the appropriate changes in this regard.  For example, it appears from our initial engagement with our legal advisers that the decision of the Court of Appeal extends to orders of up to six and 12 months.  In such cases, the amendment as proposed will not address the judgment.  We also need to carefully consider the comments made in the judgments of both the High Court and the Court of Appeal to the effect that a person should have a further right of review if detained for such a period, and how provision for this might be worded.  In addition, the position regarding existing patients needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>The foregoing points all need to be carefully considered and it is for this reason that the court gave the Government six months to remedy the situation.  I can confirm that my Department has already undertaken consultation as to next steps and I expect to be able to propose an appropriate way forward in the very short term.  We therefore must oppose this amendment, as the amendment as phrased will not answer all the questions raised in the judgment of the Court of Appeal.  I stress again to the Senator that in light of the recent court judgment I know where he and the Sinn F&eacute;in party are coming from but notwithstanding their good intentions, it is simply unhelpful from a technical and legal point of view to try to address that in this Bill in the short text of this amendment.  There are also significant concerns around the six-month issue.  As we need to nail that down before we deal with this, unfortunately we cannot support the amendment at this point.  If possible, I ask for the amendment to be withdrawn to allow the Oireachtas to engage more fully in this particular issue, which is obviously of huge concern given the court case.  That is a matter for the Senators to decide but I request them to withdraw it if appropriate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#Z02800","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Given the delays we have had so often in people accessing appropriate mental health supports and in the roll-out of resources and key areas, there is an opportunity to address this issue now, in this excellent Bill that has been put forward.

Given that the direction of the court judgment is clear and that it is clear from it that 12 months is not appropriate, we do not have to wait until the last moment to change this.  We do not have to wait until November.  Realistically, given how long it takes for legislation to come through, I do not believe there will be more amending legislation going through in time for a November deadline, as set by the courts.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to take the opportunity presented now to take a positive step in the right direction by accepting what I believe is a constructive, legally sound suggestion from Sinn F&eacute;in and agreeing to the amendment.  If we need to review the six-month period, it can be done afterwards, in the longer term.  Let us not arrive at circumstances in November in which we have failed, when given a clear opportunity, to take into account the direction given in terms of constitutional opinion.  I have noted when much weaker constitutional concerns have allowed or stymied action.  This is a clear ruling constitutionally.  I do not see any justification for the Minister of State not taking a step.  There is certainly no opinion anywhere from anybody that the period of 12 months will need to be defended.  I cannot see the logic in not accepting the amendment at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#Z02900","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I support my colleague in her assertion that this will be the only mental health Bill that will go through the Houses in the lifetime of this Government.

The reason we make laws here is to prevent confusion over rights and to ensure that those rights are upheld without people having to go to court.  The Government has guidance on what it should and should not do but it is important that we provide clarity in legislation on the rights of individuals.  There is an opportunity to do that now.

The Oireachtas deals with legislation every day.  I have a responsibility, not an option, to deal with this matter within six months.  It is an order of the court.  These Houses, not only me, must adhere to it.  There are a number of complex issues, however, and these have been addressed in the judgments.  Anybody who read the judgment of the Court of Appeal or the previous judgments would recognise the matter is not so simplistic that we can do justice to it today.  All I ask is that we, as an Oireachtas, be responsible and allow the time needed.  It is not about the here and now.  We can amend legislation at any stage and put forward proposals.  In the spirit of co-operation and to do justice to Deputy Browne's Bill, I ask for unanimous support and that we work collectively without division.  I appeal again to the House to allow me, my officials, the Department and Members to engage constructively.  I can give more detail on the complexities arising over this issue.  We will have to come back to this.  All I can assure the House is that this measure will not address the issue.

The possibility of a review of someone's detention at six months is important in a holistic sense in terms of reintegration into a community.  The detention is not a prison sentence.  It is not rocket science to contend that someone should have the status of their health reviewed on an ongoing basis, be it weekly or monthly, never mind after six months.  This should not even require legislation.  It should be normal procedure to review a patient's mental health status on an ongoing basis but the Minister of State keeps talking about complexities.  I wonder why now is not the time for him to outline the complexities associated with a person having his or her detention reviewed independently at six months.  What exactly are the complexities involved in ensuring that someone has intervention at the earliest opportunity in their mental healthcare?  When someone is discharged from detention, it does not mean they cannot still have ongoing involvement in community services, be it at six months or 12 months.  One does not cut off healthcare at that stage.  My point is on integration in respect of holistic and community care.  We closed institutions in this country and our streets became our asylums and hotels our hostels.<\/p> <p>I do not see the complexity in not further institutionalising people for up to 12 months when integration could be allowed for by having an earlier point of contact.  Could the Minister of State talk us through why this would not just be a slam dunk?

Mental Health Reform's note also states that individuals who are currently in long-stay in hospital could end up discharged from regulated inpatient services to unregulated community-based mental health services if the gap in legislation is not addressed within the next six months.

I think the Oireachtas can be proud of what we have done in the area of special education.  Despite the very difficult environment in which we have been working in recent years, we have consistently increased the resources in the area.  Since 2011, the provision in special education has been increased by about 43% and well over &euro;1.5 billion of the education budget goes into special education provision, which is considerably larger than, for example, the allocation to higher education.  We have made a very serious policy commitment to provide integrated opportunities for people with special education needs to succeed and to progress through education.<\/p> <p>I do not want to spend too much time on the type of provision but basically we seek to have an inclusive and integrated model wherever we can.  In excess of 60% of children with ASD are in mainstream classes, approximately 20% are in special classes within mainstream schools, and 20% are in special schools.  That tends to be the distribution.  There is clearly a hope that we can have as many as possible in mainstream education.<\/p> <p>We now have more than 14,000 SNAs, an increase of 33% since 2011.  We have approximately 13,500 special education teacher posts, representing a similar increase since 2011.  Special classes are becoming more prevalent and the number has increased by considerably in excess of 100%, from 548 in 2011 to more than 1,300 now, which is a very substantial expansion.  Initially much of that was at primary level, but increasingly we are seeing that move on to a very significant expansion of ASD units at second level.  We have 124 special schools with about 7,500 students.  As Senators know, the pupil-teacher ratio in special units is much more favourable at 6:1, with two SNAs.  These are very specialist support areas.  That expansion has required the Department to invest in facilities to back that up.<\/p> <p>I know the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill is yet to come to the Seanad.  That Bill allows either Tusla or the NCSE to require a school to take an individual student.  On Report Stage we will introduce an amendment allowing the NCSE after a number of steps to require a school, by way of ministerial order, to open an ASD unit or a special unit.  That is a new power to ensure we can continue to expand the provision.<\/p> <p>We may also make changes to the way we allocate money.  In September, we introduced a new model for allocating resource teachers.  The aim of the model was to frontload into schools the number of resource teachers they would need based on the profile of individual schools.  We put in extra resources to ensure we could do that in a way that no school would lose.  That is the first time we moved from the need to have a diagnostic report to trigger resource teaching.  Instead we are gearing up the schools based on the expected profile of individual schools and not only does the school now have more resources to meet the need, but it has moved away from this labelling approach.  While labelling was unnecessary in many cases, sometimes diagnoses are very helpful for teaching.  The model has moved away from unnecessary labelling where it could be avoided.  It has also promoted more of a whole-school approach to integrating special education.  It gives school principals more discretion to decide whether one-to-one, group or mainstream teaching should be used to provide that extra support.  I have visited schools using this new approach and it has been very warmly received.  People tell me it is not only good for the children with special needs, but that it is good for the entire school and gives a much more integrated approach to delivery.<\/p> <p>Senators will also be interested in the area of special needs provision.  For many years this provision has been allocated very late in the year, often in June at the end of the school year.  The system was that the Minister had to go back to Cabinet to get approval for a new financial allocation; it had not been built into the Estimates.  This year, for the first time, we have built it into the Estimates and we hope to be able to announce the allocation to schools within the next few days, allowing for much better planning.<\/p> <p>The NCSE is close to completion of its work to review the special need assistance programme to ascertain if we are delivering to meet the children's needs in the best possible way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have done much work on this.  The recent pilot which we announced on Monday gives an indication of the direction of their thinking.  This year, for 75 schools and 75 preschools in the west Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare area, CHO 7, we will introduce a scheme whereby we embed speech and language resource and occupational therapy resource within a network of schools.  They will service a network of 150 institutions including preschools, special schools and primary and secondary schools.  Based on good exemplars, we believe that not only can better one-to-one support be provided, but one can develop programmes whereby teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs and parents can provide continuity between one-to-one sessions that a child might have with a speech and language therapist.  That can transform the learning environment by establishing continuity rather than occasion access to the therapists followed by a long gap and a drop off and so on; it will integrate the therapy.  While it is a pilot, it gives a direction of the thinking coming from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that we can do better if we bring new expertise to bear within the school setting on a professional partnership basis between the SNAs, teachers and parents with a professional, allowing us to better deliver to students' needs.  That is in progress.  Based on the success of the resource teaching model, which has been well received, we hope to develop it over time.  <\/p><p>I mentioned the admissions Bill, to which we are making changes.  <\/p><p>The NCSE is the independent leader and it decides where a child is looking for a school place.  It uses its special education needs organisers, SENOs, to support parents in getting access to the appropriate setting.  If, for any reason, they do not get an appropriate setting, home schooling opportunities are available.  Some 1,700 pupils avail of home tuition although generally children wait for a suitable school placement.  We are taking new powers to support the NCSE in making sure that schools will develop.  We are very determined that no school will turn away a child because of their special education need or decline to participate in providing a special unit if that school is the most appropriate location for delivery.<\/p><p>The other service which is key to this is the national education psychological service.  Under the programme for Government, we have committed to expanding this service.  It is a really important piece of the infrastructure.  We currently have 180 whole-time equivalent psychologists in the service.  We are steadily expanding the service with the development of well-being programmes in each school.<\/p><p>The final piece of the jigsaw is school transport.  That is a very significant investment.  About 12,000 children with special needs avail of the school transport scheme at a cost of &euro;88 million.  We make a significant investment there so that children have transport to the most suitable school.<\/p><p>It is an area in which we have done a lot.  One of the ambitions for the future is to really focus to make sure that we also deliver on good outcomes.  Our inspection service show very good methodologies being deployed.  We need to ensure that as we deepen the resource commitment and improve its allocation that we see gains in children staying on more, developing their independence skills, and progressing to other opportunities.  That is an area where we need to do more analysis and develop the methodologies to record that progress and establish good objective benchmarks for evaluating policy initiatives and alternatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#JJ00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his contribution.  As the Minister noted, some good progress have been made in special education provision.  Fianna F&aacute;il is very proud of the part it has played in this along with others.  It is vitally important that every child who goes through the school gates on their first day is able to maximise their potential so that no child is left behind.<\/p> <p>My contribution here is on the provision of special needs assistance.  I heard the Minister say that he expects to make an announcement on this in coming days which is very positive.  In the past, late announcements caused serious problems as I am sure the Minister will be aware.  It caused serious problems for boards of management, school principals, parents and for special needs assistants themselves.  It was the case that allocations were not announced until some schools had gone on holidays.  This was not satisfactory because boards of management had to be brought in during the summer holidays when people were away and it caused serious disruption.  Special needs assistants did not know whether they would be allocated to a particular school for the school year ahead or whether they would have to apply elsewhere.  Everyone was in limbo and it was not satisfactory.  I welcome the Minister having looked at the area and am glad that he will make an announcement this week or maybe early next week.  It is very positive and it would be uncharitable not to acknowledge that the Minister has taken on board the concerns of all the stakeholders in making that announcement.  <\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the delay in the construction of special needs schools.  I understand that commitments and promises were made to construct ten schools for the start of the 2016-2017 school year.  I understand that 70% of those schools have yet to move beyond the planning stage.  That is disappointing.  When we make commitments and promised to anyone, but especially to those in the area of special needs, it is important that we stand over those promises and deliver what we say we will.   Will the Minister make a comment on the status of those ten schools and what stage of construction they have reached when he sums up the debate?  As the Minister observed, the progress made in special needs provision is very positive.  There is much more that we can do but much progress has been made of which we can be proud.  Our children will be its beneficiaries.<\/p> <p>I now turn to school transport.  The Minister will not need me to remind him of the issues on this that all of us across the country encountered last year.  From what I hear, it might be even worse this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#KK00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526463000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
