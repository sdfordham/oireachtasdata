I appreciate that this is a particularly busy time for him and his presence this morning is to be appreciated by all.  I acknowledge the fact the Minister made an effort to come here to address this very important issue.<\/p> <p>As the Minister is aware, tomorrow 17 May marks the 44th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Some 33 people in Monaghan and Dublin lost their lives on that day and it turned out to be the worst loss of life of the entire period of the Troubles.  I take this opportunity to request of the Minister a renewed effort on his part and, indeed, on the part of the Government so that the files in relation to this particular issue are released by the British Government in order that the people of Dublin and, indeed, Monaghan can have final closure on this issue.<\/p> <p>It is difficult to imagine that 44 years on we are no wiser as to who was responsible, what happened or what group was responsible for this atrocity in which 33 people lost their lives - seven from County Monaghan and 26 from Dublin.  We can only imagine the pain the families continue to endure over this period of time and that pain is compounded by the absence of more than four decades of the truth of what actually happened on that day.  People have campaigned for many years.  Justice for the Forgotten deserves credit for its continued renewed efforts over many years to try to find justice and the truth of what happened.  Every year on the anniversary of this event, all Members of both Houses renew our determination to try to find some comfort for those who have suffered.  As the anniversary approaches tomorrow, our thoughts and our prayers are with the victims and their families at this difficult time of commemoration.<\/p> <p>I am sure it is difficult for the families to appreciate that no one has been charged, much less convicted for that day of carnage and the truth of what actually happened remains a mystery.  Indeed, the families' quest for truth and justice has been painfully slow, blocked in every direction and largely ignored.  The British Government must make those documents available.  There must be some international agreement that it is breaching by not so doing.  The British Government has said that it would set up an inquiry into what happened but we still await the outcome of that.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister in his new role and his new portfolio to reinvigorate our efforts and the efforts of the Government on behalf of the people of this country, especially the people of Monaghan and Dublin, to request the British Government to release the papers so that the families can finally bring closure to this and so that they can put the memories of their loved ones to rest and finally realise who or what was behind that atrocity on that fateful day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#A00250","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I am very aware that in the week of the 44th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings that this is hugely sensitive time for the families concerned.  That tragic incident saw the biggest loss of life in any single day during the Troubles, as pointed out by the Senator.  It is important to acknowledge politicians across the Oireachtas who work on a cross-party basis with the Government on this issue, in support of the tireless efforts of Justice for the Forgotten which is playing such an important role, in terms of trying to move this process forward.<\/p> <p>The Government will be represented at the wreath-laying ceremony tomorrow to mark the anniversary of these tragic events by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan.

These motions call on the British Government to allow access to an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Mr. Seamus Ludlow.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-party motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department.  I raised the issue again in person with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, last month and my officials were in touch with their British counterparts as recently as last week.

As he is aware, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health.  We produced a report on orphan drugs, in particular trying to fast-track the process and bring more certainty at an earlier stage.  I understand that the assessment process for many drugs here takes, on average, 23 months before a decision is made on moving forward to the next stage in the process.  The people who are doing research and development in this area spend a lot of time and money trying to bring forward products which can be of benefit to people.  Likewise, the number of people who would benefit from such drugs is quite small but it is very important to them.  Over the past two or three years, a number of ongoing battles about whether a drug would receive approval have taken place in the public domain.

Medicines play a vital role in improving the overall health of Irish patients.  Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish health service.  The challenge is to deliver on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p><p>As of 11 May 2018, there are 120 orphan drugs in Europe.  Of these, 12 have been refused by the European Medicines Agency, four have been withdrawn and 104 have had approvals.  It is expected that the trend will be towards more applications for orphan drugs in the years ahead.  That is why it is essential that Ireland has a scientific, robust and evidence-based assessment process in place.  This ensures that decisions on the reimbursement of medicines are made on an objective and scientific basis, recognising the health needs of the population and other factors.<\/p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides the legal framework in Ireland for such a process.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of expert opinion as appropriate.  The HSE follows the process set out in the Act for the assessment of all drugs, including orphan drugs.  While orphan drugs are assessed in the same way as other drugs, the HSE is mindful of the differences and challenges in terms of patient numbers. <\/p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible and within 180 days.  However, because of the significant moneys involved, the HSE must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis.  Successful price negotiations also allow for further drugs to be approved within the finite budget available.<\/p><p>A study published in December 2017 in the <i>European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology<\/i>concluded that the majority of European countries do not have a separate reimbursement system for orphan drugs.  The Department of Health has received the report on evaluating orphan drugs from the Joint Committee on Health.  The Department is examining the committee&rsquo;s report and its recommendations.  The report raises some significant policy issues which require careful consideration.  <\/p><p>The Minister and the Department are very aware of the human side of this entire process.  A medicinal products review committee has been established as part of the recommendations advocated by the national rare disease plan.  This committee will look at the possibility of devising managed access programmes for patients, including orphan drugs, and will consider the need for different assessment criteria to apply in the case of drugs for rare diseases.  The Government is committed in the programme for partnership to look at opportunities for leveraging purchasing power.  That is why, over the past two years, my Department has been engaging with other European countries in an effort to identify solutions to medicines pricing, sustainability and supply.<\/p><p>Ireland is participating in several voluntary EU forums, including round-table meetings with EU health Ministers and the pharmaceutical industry, high level pharmaceutical policy meetings, the BeNeLuxA collaboration and the Valletta technical committee.  These platforms are currently exploring possible areas for co-operation including information sharing, horizon scanning and possible price negotiations and joint procurement.<\/p><p>Ensuring timely and sustainable access to new medicines, especially orphan medicines, is a key priority of the Minister.  The Department and the HSE are actively working towards this goal.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#B00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The European Medicines Agency approves drugs and we then seem to go through a process which takes over two years.

This is the fifth occasion on which I have raised this issue.  I have raised it three times on the Order of Business and this is the second Commencement matter I have tabled in respect of it.  More than six months have passed since I raised it by way of a Commencement matter.  At that point, it had already been two and a half years since enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  It is now three years since the legislation was passed but families, particularly LGBTQI couples who conceive through assisted human reproduction methods, still do not have equal family status because the Government has not commenced Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  Why is this taking so long?  The impact of this Government inaction includes preventing a family from applying for an Irish passport and citizenship for their child, preventing the child from accessing his or her parents' estate if they die and preventing a parent from making emergency health decisions on behalf of a child where the legal parent is unable to do so.<\/p> <p>During the debate on the Commencement matter I tabled in December 2017, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, said, \"If possible, it will be implemented by the end of January and if not, then the beginning of February.\"  This followed repeated missed deadlines on the part of the Department.  These deadlines were late 2016, early 2017, mid-2017 and late 2017.  Following parliamentary questions or questions on promised legislation in the D&aacute;il on the topic, the Department's responses have omitted a deadline and simply state that a small number of technical issues are holding matters up and that Parts 2 and 3 will be commenced as soon as possible.  The most recent responses have the added element of requiring advice from the Attorney General.  It has taken the Department over two years just to figure this out.  Surely these technical issues would have been resolved by now had they have been given priority over the past three years.  We need an open and honest explanation of the delay and a truthful deadline as to when families can expect certainty on this issue.<\/p> <p>The Leader, Senator Buttimer, sought a meeting last month involving me, departmental officials and the families affected but the Department rejected his request.  All I wish is for departmental officials to meet the families affected and explain why they have delayed the commencement of these people's rights and left them vulnerable.  As matters stand, the families are being stonewalled.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to give an in-depth explanation as to why the Department has taken three years to provide crucial rights to LGBTQI families and give a definite timeline as to when they can expect these rights to be conferred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#C00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types.

The responsibility of my Department relates solely to the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 and associated regulations.  As well as making regulations in respect of donor-assisted human reproduction procedures, Parts 2 and 3 make provision for children conceived through the assistance of a donor.  This includes mandating for non-anonymous donation and the establishment of a national donor-conceived person register to enable children to access information on their donor and genetically related siblings when they come of age, should they so wish.<\/p> <p>These provisions were specifically included in the Act to underpin the rights of the child under Article 42A of the Constitution and Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to have information on genetic heritage.  Detailed regulation of these provisions will ensure that the information on any child born of donor conception will be recorded securely, in compliance with existing and forthcoming data protection legislation, and in a manner which can be accessed by that child when he or she is of age.  Parts 2 and 3 also provide legal clarity on parental rights and responsibilities.<\/p> <p>Officials in my Department have prepared draft regulations to facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.

Like many hospitals throughout the country, Sligo University Hospital faces many ongoing challenges, including cost pressures, recruitment issues, inpatient and day-case waiting lists, OPD waiting times and increased trolley pressures.  Among the biggest challenges is that relating to bed capacity and Sligo University Hospital is no different from many other hospitals in seeking additional beds.  Unfortunately, Sligo University Hospital&rsquo;s capacity has reduced by 13% over the past ten years .  Put simply, it needs more beds.  The situation has been aggravated by the hospital losing 42 inpatient beds since 2004 and the increase in trolley pressures has presented a clear-cut case for additional bed capacity.  This capacity challenge is set to become greater because Ireland has an ageing population.  In that context, it is estimated that there will be a 40% increase in the number of people aged 65 and over in the next ten years.<\/p> <p>We are all aware of the huge pressures on bed capacity in our hospitals, especially during winter months.  Last January was no different, with emergency departments such as that in Sligo under enormous strain due to high demand and the increased incidence of flu mainly affecting older people.  Many Senators will be aware that the recent health service capacity review identified the need for 2,600 additional acute hospital beds over the next ten years.  I understand that 600 will become available nationally in the coming year.  The Government is fully committed to the provision of these extra acute hospital beds under the Project Ireland 2040 framework unveiled in Sligo last February.<\/p> <p>I also take this opportunity to appeal directly to Minister for Health to ensure that Sligo University Hospital gets its fair share of these additional beds.  I hope that some of these beds - with the associated staffing - can come on stream prior to next winter.  Extra beds for Sligo will also certainly help smooth the transition to the new surgical and emergency department block being developed at the hospital.  Many other excellent projects being planned at the hospital, such as the development of a cardiac catheterisation laboratory service, a radiology suite, a diabetes day unit and a central sterile services department, CSSD, upgrade.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend the hospital on its ongoing efforts to advance these projects but increased bed capacity continues to be a key priority.

I understand that approximately 200 beds opened last winter across some of our hospitals, and more are due to come on stream later in the year.  I attended a meeting in Sligo over two weeks ago when the management team briefed local politicians on all the various matters affecting them.

As he will be aware, the Department of Health has undertaken a health service capacity review in line with the programme for a partnership Government commitment, the findings of which provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.  If reforms are implemented, the report concludes, as the Senator points out, that nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds will be required by 2031.  As a first step towards implementing this recommendation, I have asked my Department to work with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system that can be opened and staffed this year and in 2019.  The HSE is continuing to develop this proposal, with the aim of formulating an evidence-based plan for increasing bed capacity nationally, which will form the basis of discussions with colleagues in government on the financing of this important programme of work.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan has specifically asked me to speak today on proposed plans for Sligo University Hospital.  I can confirm that the HSE has been working with the Saolta hospital group on the development of specific proposals for all its hospitals.  Currently, this includes a proposal for a new modular build for Sligo University Hospital that would increase bed capacity at this site by up to 52 inpatient beds.  The proposal in respect of Sligo University Hospital, along with all those submitted by other hospitals, is currently being assessed by the HSE in terms of its feasibility, including matters of staffing, costing, timeline and impact, with a view to bringing an overall plan to my Department for consideration and discussion with colleagues in government.  Therefore, while I understand the Senator's wish to have a clear response on this matter today, I must await the outcome of the process under way.<\/p> <p>As outlined in the capacity review, the demographic pressures being experienced by the health service are such as to demand not just additional capacity but continued emphasis on health and well-being initiatives, an improved model of care with a stronger role for enhanced community-based services and continued improvement in productivity, including in acute hospitals.  The Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years.  This will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand.  Importantly, the accelerated introduction of additional capacity for 2018 and 2019 will be matched by forthcoming reforms, including the publication of a detailed Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan and the overhaul of the current GP contract.<\/p> <p>We all acknowledge that the challenges we face are significant and of that there is little doubt.  However, it is my firm belief that all of us want to find the right solutions - patient-centred, evidence-based, results-focused and sustainable - to the challenges currently facing our health services.  I know we have a long road ahead of us but 2018 will be the start of this journey of reform and strengthening of our health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The latest figures, for March, show a further increase in the number on the CAMHS waiting list in the capital, from 156 at the end of 2017, to 164.  We all talk about early intervention being the best way to improve outcomes for children but we see absolutely no action.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Health to look at CAMHS services as children and adolescents are our future and we need to invest in them now.  Early intervention is crucial.  This also applies to waiting lists for speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  The waiting lists are getting bigger and nobody seems to be getting any treatment.<\/p><p>My second issue relates to housing and, particularly, the rental market in Dublin.  We have a peculiar situation here with tourists in residential accommodation and the homeless in hotels.  In 2017, Dublin City Council spent &euro;97.48 million on emergency accommodation, with some hotels in our city being paid over &euro;1 million.  We learn from a <i>daft.ie<\/i>report today that over half of rental properties in Dublin are listed on a short-term basis only.  That means 53% of homes on the Dublin rental market are not available to long-term tenants.  It is easy to remedy this.  It has been brought to the Government's attention time and time again.  The Government must put in place legislation to disincentivise this market behaviour.  It has been highlighted before and it is time for the Government to take action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>This is my first opportunity to address the House since the very disappointing decision by Apple to scrap its plans for a data centre in Athenry in Galway.  I can tell Senators that, even from my brief discussions with the business community in the US, this has generated a real negative feel factor about the investment environment in Ireland.  I am deeply concerned that, having invested so much political capital in Europe to protect our corporation tax rate, we have lost sight of other key pillars of what investors are looking at when they are thinking about entering, or expanding in the Irish market.<\/p> <p>Clearly, our planning process, and within that our court system, have proven a total and absolute barrier to economic development.  This is not something that can be simply shrugged off or seen as an isolated case.  When a major brand like Apple takes a decision like this, it resonates in boardrooms right across corporate America and, I am sure, further afield.  We are constantly competing with other similar-sized and larger countries who seek to emulate our model, and the investment community needs to see this Government respond in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p>There are many lessons which must be learned from the Apple case that, in my view, are not as complex as perhaps some seem to make out.  The most important one is time.  It took six months for Galway County Council to approve planning for the data centre, which in my mind does not seem an unreasonable length of time for a project of this magnitude.  However, what happened after that is deeply disappointing.  It took a full 12 months from the appeal of Galway County Council's decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be determined, and that appeal upheld the council's planning approval.  It then took 14 months from that decision, which was challenged before the High Court in the Commercial Court, which is supposed to be a fast-tracked court for Mr. Justice McDermott to deliver a judgment, which again upheld the original planning approval.  It took a further seven months after that decision for the Supreme Court to decide only that it was willing to hear an appeal.<\/p> <p>This means that, in total, from the formal planning application to the Supreme Court decision to admit the appeal a few days ago, a total of three years and three months have elapsed.  Quite frankly, this is some kind of a sick joke of a system for an economic development of this nature, and I do not use that language lightly.  There has been a lot of talk about the objectors and their vested interests or otherwise, but in my view that deflects from the central issue.  One of the largest brands in the world, which employs 5,500 people here, chose Ireland for a further almost &euro;1 billion investment and our planning and legal system, despite upholding that everything which Apple was intending to do was completely lawful, took three years and three months to deliver its decision, with a further one potentially pending if Apple had decided to stick around.<\/p> <p>I do not blame Apple.  Why would any business stick around when faced with another 12, if not 18, months after an almost three and half year debacle?  I recognise that the Government has announced changes so that major infrastructure projects will go through An Bord Plean&aacute;la first, but that body took one year in the Apple case, whereas the council actually took six months.  I equally recognise the announcement by the President of the High Court, in a practice direction issued in February this year, that Mr. Justice Barniville is specially assigned to exclusively deal with all applications for permission to challenge decisions concerning strategic infrastructure developments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is welcome, but I question whether it goes far enough.  If a person challenges what is thought to be a quicker decision made by this new specially assigned court, what will stop the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court causing further delays, only later to uphold the original decision when the investment might be gone?<\/p><p>In the United States it is common in certain state courts, including appeal courts, for specific deadlines to be imposed for a court to deliver a judgment.  Why can a similar system not be introduced here for certain cases?  Similarly, if all major infrastructure projects are to be brought directly before An Bord Plean&aacute;la why can we not mandate specific maximum timelines and then impose similar timelines for the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court?  The global investment community needs to know that we want its big capital investment projects in this country and that the shambles with Apple will never be repeated.  I am deeply concerned that this message has not been conveyed.  We must have more innovative thinking that will offer investors absolute certainty that this country remains open for business.<\/p><p>I wish to congratulate our two new Members, Senators Marshall and Lawlor.

He captured not only the realities and sometimes the cruelties of existence in times of pressure but also the passion for life and the extraordinarily transcendent power of the imagination.  He celebrates what it is to be able to tell one's stories in difficult circumstances.

The Irish Society for Colitis and Crohn's Disease had a meeting with the Minister for Health six months ago to seek a commitment from him to appoint 14 additional inflammatory bowel disease expert nurses to assist patients in the better management of their condition and to keep them out of hospital.  A statement was made by the HSE, and by the Minister to the best of my recollection, in November last year that 120 additional advanced nurse practitioners would be appointed.  Some of those nurses have been appointed, but to different disciplines.<\/p> <p>I ask the House to support me and the Irish Society for Colitis and Crohn's Disease in calling for the appointment of 14 additional inflammatory bowel disease nurses to help the 20,000 IBD patients across the country to manage their conditions better and to keep them out of hospital.  Many Members of the House will be familiar with this debilitating condition which can keep people out of work for a long time and affects families and relationships.  This is a no-brainer.  It makes vast economic sense.  For a small investment we can engage double the current number of inflammatory bowel disease nurses and ensure there is a proper regional spread across the country.  It would be timely, in advance of the celebration of World IBD Day next Saturday, if the Minister would make a statement committing to doubling the number of IBD nurses in the country to assist the growing number of patients with IBD. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#H01200","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I take serious exception to Senator Rose Conway-Walsh's comments about the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is one of the most sincere, hard-working politicians this country has ever had.

We have had many debates on this and we have heard a lot of commentary about the loss of young people to the agriculture industry.  There is an anomaly in the training of young farmers.  The qualification a trained farmer receives is known as a green cert and this can be achieved in two different ways, either by attending agricultural college for a full-time course or on a part-time basis through courses mainly run by Teagasc.  A person, however, cannot do the part-time course if he or she is under the age of 23.  This needs to be raised with the Minister and the Minister needs to look at it very closely.  A young man or woman is an integral part of the operation of a small family farm holding in Ireland and their parents cannot afford or acquire labour to replace them while they are away on a full-time course.  If it is good enough to do the course on a part-time basis after the age of 23, I do not see why it cannot be done after the leaving cert.<\/p> <p>One case came to my attention recently.  A father is in ill health and his son wished to do the training but, because he is only 19, he cannot do it part time and must wait until he is 23.  The elephant in the room is that most, if not all, farm payments due to that business are dependent on him having the qualification.  The farm will not be able to draw down the payments it needs for five years.  I cannot see the difference between doing the course at 18 or 23 on a part-time basis, in the evenings in winter, for example.

I mentioned it briefly during our debate on Europe Day last week.  I want to bring to the attention of the House the fact that there have been systematic attacks on different layers of Catalonian society.  To date, nine politicians have been jailed.  There are no dates for trial.  Effectively, they are being interned.  A total of 900 mayors are being investigated for facilitating the referendum last year.  Former officials of the Catalan Government have been charged with misuse of funds simply for inviting people - diplomats - to visit Catalonia, which is something that has gone on for years.  Civil rights groups are under attack for giving out information.  For handing out leaflets, they have been charged with hate speech and hate crimes.  Teachers are being prosecuted for hate crimes.  Their crime was to facilitate debate in schools.  Simply to facilitate a debate is now a crime in Catalonia.  The firemen who courageously defended people when they were voting are being charged.  They were standing in the way of police who were trying to batter people at the time.  They are being charged with hate crimes.  The colour yellow has effectively been banned in Catalonia.  At the Copa del Rey final involving Barcelona a few weeks ago, yellow T-shirts - no slogans just yellow in colour - were taken off the people wearing them.  The speaker of the Catalonian Parliament has been arrested for facilitating a debate in the Chamber.  What we have, right here in Europe, is effectively the most horrendous authoritarian clampdown on civil rights, even on freedom of speech.<\/p> <p>I wish to request a debate on this matter.  One does not have to be in favour of Catalan independence - I certainly am and I make no apologies for it - to recognise that something fundamentally wrong is happening in Catalonia right now.  There is an horrendous clampdown on civil rights.  I do not think any of us should be willing to countenance the wall of silence that has been built up in respect of this matter.

After 20 years, we wanted to renew the agreement.  Many issues were raised, such as the undocumented Irish and looking for answers to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, on which we feel there are not enough answers.  There is one aspect which I feel we have allowed to happen.  Last weekend in Donegal, a hotel was going to have a function to celebrate the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle but it cannot now do so because thugs who call themselves republicans rang up and intimidated the hotel in order to stop the function going ahead.

As we all know, 209 cases of cancer were diagnosed where results should have been escalated.  Sadly, 18 of those poor patients have passed on.  I want to flag a patient, Jacinta Doyle, who is a Wexford lady and a mother of two.  She had a smear in 2011 and no issues were raised with that smear, but in 2012 she was diagnosed with cancer when she went to her GP complaining of back pain.  In fact, she had to pay for a private scan herself in order to obtain a diagnosis.  My concern regarding to the whole controversy is the apparent fire-fighting approach adopted by the HSE and CervicalCheck.  This lady spent 12 days trying to get answers on where she should go next.  She rang the helpline on 28 April and 3 May.  On 7 May, she contacted the helpline via Facebook.  It was only on 10 May that she was informed that her original smear was tested in the US and that the lab is no longer used.<\/p> <p>The constant drip feeding of information is not good enough.  It is only in the past few days that GPs got clear notification on how to offer free smears to patients.  Said notification indicates that if a patient has a medical card, the GP can fill out a special claim, through a special type consultation, STC, form, and put the card number on it.  For private patients who do not have medical cards, GPs can put those people's PPS numbers on the special claim forms.  I understand this may be a breach of data protection and the HSE has yet to clarify this.  It is time that CervicalCheck redoubled its efforts to try to allay the fears of the women of Ireland.<\/p> <p>I understand that the Scally inquiry is under way, but cold clinical words were used when discussing what CervicalCheck saw as a potential scandal and this was wrong.  Confidence in the programme has been undermined.  As a GP, it is my duty to encourage women to continue to attend for screening and to come to me and other GPs throughout the country with any concerns or symptoms they may have.  It is important to recognise, despite the fiasco, that over the past ten years, 80% of eligible women have attended for their scheduled smears and this has led to a progressive reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  These numbers speak for themselves and we should use our platform here in the Seanad to encourage women to continue with the screening process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#K00700","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that No. 12 on the Order Paper be taken before No. 1.

The expert review of the Mental Health Act recommended this be addressed without delay, and this is what I am doing today.  The legislation is about rights and stating mental health should be treated with the same set of principles as physical health.  It is about young people having rights over their own mental healthcare.  It is about the stigmatising mental health.

It was marvellous.<\/p><p>The Queen, her gracious majesty by God-ordained, is three times directly descended from Brian Boru, once from Hugh O'Neill, rebel Earl of Tyrone, and Prince Harry is also a descendent of the Roches of Cork.  We have, therefore, a direct Irish interest in the royal wedding.  It is a bit of fun, it is pageantry, it is glam, people love it.  It is a real soap opera.  People are going to be on tenterhooks to see if daddy turns up or if he will be doing another gig with the paparazzi.  It is great fun. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#K00900","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Do you have an invitation, Senator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#L00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I am afraid I have not.

In particular, on the \"Claire Byrne Live\" show on Monday night, I completely respect that people disagree on the issue with regard to the referendum.  That is to be absolutely expected.  There would be something wrong if people did not disagree.  It has been a difficult issue for this country to discuss for many years.<\/p> <p>However, the Irish people were the real losers in that debate.  The atmosphere was aggressive, disrespectful and somewhat demeaning to be a part of.  To have the memory of a woman like Ms Savita Halappanavar responded to by jeering and heckling when her name was mentioned, regardless of the context, was a new low in the debate.  I hope that other programmes learn from this.<\/p> <p>I understand that a lot of the time in this debate, it is an echo chamber, as people have their minds made up.  On \"Claire Byrne Live\" a lot of people were there with fully formed views and that has to be respected on all sides.  Equally, there were people watching at home who needed to access information that really was not getting out.  This may be considered good TV but for me it was appalling.  If one was willing to be aggressive in one's approach there was more airtime and I think that is regrettable.<\/p> <p>As regards the Down's syndrome point, which is a point that Senator McFadden has made very well, the committee categorically decided and recommended that disability would not be a ground for termination in this country.  The legislation has wholeheartedly taken on our recommendation in that regard.  For the \"No\" side of the campaign to insist on using Down's syndrome babies is really appalling.  I understand the Down's syndrome association has been very upset about this.  I have to categorically state as the former Chair of that committee, that Down's syndrome is not something that was ever envisaged as such a ground, and there are many of the committee members who would be extremely uncomfortable with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#L00700","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  Can I thank the 14 Members of the House for their contributions to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Can I begin on my own behalf, as Leader of the House, with Senators Conway-Walsh, Higgins and Nash, in paying tribute to the memory of the late Tom Murphy, the playwright who passed away.  As Senator Nash rightly said, he was a playwright who held up a mirror up to the nation.  In his work he very ably and sometimes controversially portrayed a different type of Ireland to what some people might have expected to have seen on the stage.<\/p> <p>As the youngest of ten children, all of his siblings emigrated and that may have had a bearing on his work and an influence on him.  He was, as has already been said here today, a playwright who was influenced by his life.  Emigration and displacement were part of what he has written.  It is a testimony to him that the President, Michael D. Higgins, who paid tribute to him this morning and earlier presented an award to him, described him as the playwright of the emigrant, whose contribution to Irish theatre has been immense and unique.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the House can I offer our sympathies to his family.  Ar Dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of CAMHS.  Obviously the issue of CAMHS waiting times is a challenge.  There are, as Senator Ardagh is aware, acknowledged difficulties in the recruitment and retention of specialist CAMHS staff around consultant psychiatry.  Recruitment is continuing, both internationally and locally.  In the recent budget, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Daly, secured &euro;35 million for new mental health initiatives and I think what he is trying to do, which is very important, is to create more appropriate referral system, whereby people do not have to be automatically seen by a psychiatrist.  What he is talking about here is more levels of intervention at a lower level. He is right.  Everybody has to be seen by a consultant psychiatrist.  However, in saying that this is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The Government is committed to doing that.  We have seen that 114 assistant psychologists and 18 psychologists posts have just been filled in the counselling and primary care service, which will relieve pressure in specialist CAMHS.  It is important, and I accept the point made by Senator Ardagh, that young people especially, who are particularly vulnerable who need intervention and who need assistance, receive same in a timely manner.  I concur with the Senator's remarks.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh also referred to the issue of housing.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, through Rebuilding Ireland is very committed to increasing the housing stock, and to the provision of both social and affordable housing and building in general.  The point the Senator made in respect of the issue of the number of homes available for long-term letting is one that needs to be addressed urgently and that is why Government is addressing this through a compendium of measures.<\/p> <p>The big issue is that there are people who were in the long-term rental market as landlords and have decided to get out of it.  In some cases it is to sell and in other cases it is because Airbnb is easier for them.  We need to get that balance right.  Some people come in here every day shouting about X and others will look to have Y defended.  There is a balance to be struck and I agree with the Senator on that point.  I will ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House again in regard to this matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Lawless made a very important point about Apple and we discussed it last week on the Order of Business.  The Senator is right.  The decision of Apple has a repercussion that we may not feel in the short term, but in the medium and long term it may well send a message to international investors that Ireland is not a place to locate.  We have an obligation now as a Government and as Members of this House to sell the message through the IDA and through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, under Deputy Humphreys, that we are open for business.  That is why the Government took decisions on strategic infrastructure development whereby one has fast-track planning.  We had this debate last week.  It is about ensuring that we get a balance on the rights of the person to object and the rights of the company to develop.  The Senator is correct in that regard.  I commend the Senator for the work he is doing in promoting Ireland across the United States.<\/p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh, McFadden and Noone made reference indirectly and directly to the issue of health as regards the cervical cancer issue and the eighth amendment, which are not linked.  I do not want to pick a row on the Order of Business on a very important sensitive matter.  I appreciate that Senator Conway-Walsh has left to attend the health committee.  It is because of the interventions of this morning, that there is a need to take this issue out of the political arena.  We have an independent statutory inquiry established under Professor Scally.  I remind Members who may not agree with my next couple of remarks to read his memo which I referenced here yesterday.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an independent, eminent scholar heading up an inquiry and he expressed concern about the \"fevered atmosphere\" around the issue.  In correspondence he said he was making progress in the investigation but expressed concern that the current fevered atmosphere is posing some problems.  I chaired the Joint Committee on Health for five years and, as I have said here every day, when an eminent scholar like this is leading an investigation and is saying that people and officials are being distracted from the work he is undertaking because they need to appear before Oireachtas committees, we have to ask what we want to get.  Do we want to have an independent inquiry which will get to the bottom of all this or do we want to have a three-ring circus which ends up in nothing happening?  That is a choice.  We can leave it in the political arena and have people stepping in and stepping out on \"Prime Time\", \"Claire Byrne Live\" and \"The Tonight Show\".  What I have said from the beginning of this awful period is that we have to have accountability.  People must be held to account on the basis of all of the facts being made available.  <\/p><p>The overarching concern must be support for the women who have been let down by the system.  That is why last Friday, the Government announced a series of measures were being put in place.  As Senator Swanick also said, we have a duty to restore confidence in the cancer screening programme and the HPV vaccination because vaccination and screening work.  That is what we must be about.  We can politicise the issue if Members want but I want to see the women and their families supported, the system rectified, confidence in the cancer screening programme restored and those who have done wrong held to account based upon the full facts.  I certainly hope that we will not see people using committees of these Houses to politicise this issue because it is not about that.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins raised the issue of online manipulation and fake accounts.  She made a very good point in that regard.  There is more work to be done and I hope that we can work collectively to ensure that happens.  I commend Senator Nash for his contribution with regard to inflammatory bowel disease.  The points he made are well supported.  Government has committed to funding a variety of posts through the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  I do not have all the information to hand but I will certainly be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.<\/p><p>Senators McFadden and Noone also raised the issue of the referendum with regard to posters and broadcasting of debates.  The Oireachtas committee on which Senator Gavan, Senator Noone and I sat expressly prohibited and outlawed the issue of disability as part of our report, which is now before the people in a referendum.  People have a right to have different viewpoints from one another's.  That is called democracy.  However, the use of young adults or young children on a poster is both unfair and is wrong.  These are people who have a life, who have an opinion and who have feelings.  They are affected by the posters and they speak about them.  They have spoken to me about them.  We are letting them down in this case.<\/p><p>I am all in favour of the right to have a debate in a referendum campaign.  If people vote \"No\", as some will choose to, that will be their decision and I accept that, but please let us not go into the arena and the space in which we use people for political gain in the context of this referendum.  The point made by Senator Noone regarding the format of the debate, which we also discussed yesterday, is one which I hope the Referendum Commission can take up with the relevant broadcasters because it was unedifying.  Whether it was the \"Yes\" voters or the \"No\" voters in the audience last Monday night, the middle ground got lost in the debate.  It was not about the people on one side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#L00800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Both sides were bad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#M00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Both sides-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#M00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Except for Dr. Peter Boylan and Deputy Mary Lou McDonald who were terrific.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#M00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I made my remarks on that on yesterday's Order of Business and it has been well documented.

To quote from his speech this morning, he has, \"consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin-Monaghan atrocities.\"  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear on that.  I thank Senator Boyhan for his remarks.  The Government is not opposing the Private Members' motion this afternoon, as the Senator knows, and we will have that debate later on.  Again, it is important that we ascertain all of the facts and that justice prevails at all times.<\/p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the very important issue of home care packages in Mayo and the length of waiting times.  The pertinent point she makes is that the HSE has the information and that people should not have to wait an inordinate length of time for funding or for a place to be allocated because it has ramifications in that there are people in beds in hospitals who are depriving other people of access to the system when they could be at home or in a transition or step-down facility.  The point the Senator makes is very valid.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of Catalonia.  There was a motion before the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the name of Senator Gavan's party leader.  It is under review.  On the point he makes on the new arrangement now in place in Catalonia, as I said earlier it is important that people are allowed to express a different viewpoint, to protest in a peaceful democratic manner and to have their voice heard.  I have always been supportive of that.  I hope the issue in Catalonia is resolved.  I know Mr. Puigdemont is not under arrest.  I think he is still in Germany.

This amendment, which I will quote to ensure there is no ambiguity, is to section 17, and reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>On page 17, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;(1) The District Court may try summarily a person or body corporate charged with a summary or indictable offence under this Act if&mdash;(a) the Court is of opinion that the facts proved or alleged constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily,<br \/><br \/>(b) the accused, on being informed by the Court of his, her or its right to be tried with a jury, does not object to being tried summarily, and <br \/><br \/>(c) the Director of Public Prosecutions consents to the accused being tried summarily for the offence.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>The aim of this amendment is a simple one.  It is to ensure that if an accused is prosecuted for an offence under this Act, the accused has the option to elect for a jury trial.  As the Bill stands, if a person or body corporate is prosecuted for an offence under this Act on a summary basis, in other words, where the maximum custodial sentence is 14 months, that criminal trial would be heard before a District Court judge.<\/p><p>Many people may say the offences will have lesser penalties and that this is an efficient way for a crime to be prosecuted.  It is already the case that for certain theft and fraud offences an accused can elect to have their trial heard by a jury even when prosecuted on a summary basis.  I cannot see how offences prosecuted under a corruption Act are any less consequential than theft and fraud offences.<\/p><p>I recognise that the Minister wishes to have this Bill passed by June.  I want to facilitate that but when it comes to a person's liberty and ensuring they receive a fair trial, we have to be extremely careful that in our collective desire to ensure no person is above the law, we do not lose sight of due process.

As has been said, the amendment relates to section 17 of the Bill to provide for a right of election for an accused to be tried summarily.  It is a similar approach to that which is being taken in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951 and section 53 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, but the key difference is that the provisions in those Acts relate to offences that are specified in various items of legislation to be triable on indictment only.  The provision, therefore, gives jurisdiction to the District Court to try summarily what would otherwise have been an indictable offence and therefore subject to a trial by jury.<\/p><p>The amendment proposed by Senator Boyhan does not sit neatly with the provisions of this Bill as currently constructed.  It already provided for proceedings to be tried summarily or on indictment.  This approach to the construction of offences, which is known as a hybrid offence, has been widely used in the Statute Book for the past decade or more.  It appears what Senator Boyhan wishes to achieve, supported by Senator Norris, is that an accused would have a right to object to being tried summarily in a given case in which instance the DPP would make a decision on whether to try the accused for the offence on indictment.<\/p><p>While I appreciate the importance of trial by jury in our legal system, it has long been accepted that minor offences can and should be tried in the absence of a jury.  For practical reasons, and often for other reasons, it would be an offence of a more minor nature that would be accepted by the prosecution pre-trial.  The important thing is to balance the rights of the accused persons with the effective and efficient administration of justice.  The Constitution provides only that minor offences be tried summarily in the absence of a jury.<\/p><p>In drafting the Bill I have given careful consideration to the construction of offences and I am happy that the approach in the Bill is the best way forward.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions elects to try an offence summarily, the court must still accept jurisdiction and will only do so if the offence is a minor offence.  The Supreme Court, in the case of Reade <i>v.<\/i>Reilly, has expressed the clear view that an election by the DPP to try a case summarily does not bind the District Court to do so and explained that this was to ensure that the rights of an accused to a trial by jury for a non-minor offence would not be unduly interfered with.<\/p><p>As I mentioned previously, the provisions in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951 and in section 53 of the Criminal Justice (Fraud and Theft Offences) Act 2001 relate to indictable offences only, not hybrid offences as we have provided for in this Bill.  Even in the wording of the amendment as proposed, it is clear that it does not make sense in the context of what in effect is a hybrid offence.  For example, the amendment states that the District Court may try summarily a person or body corporate charged with a summary or indictable offence, essentially providing that a summary offence may be tried summarily, which seems to be an obvious statement of fact.<\/p><p>I see where the Deputy is coming from but having regard to the construct of the Bill, I am not prepared to accept his amendment because the consequences have not been fully considered.  I know Senators feel strongly about it.

I am supporting the Bill.  I am reminded of what the Taoiseach said in his only address to this House.  He spoke of our role and that he wished to see more legislation.  We are redundant if we do not deal with this.  There is very little legislation coming through this House at the moment - that unfortunately is the way the pipeline is.  The Taoiseach appealed to us to actively and rigorously pursue and scrutinise legislation.  That is the primary function of this House.  <\/p><p>Senator Leyden has now left the Chamber, having made his statement that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Bill but would not be supporting the amendment or amendments - I could not quite understand.  He has not heard us speak.  In a democracy I like to hear what people have to say before I make a call on something.  I have spoken to Fianna F&aacute;il people myself.  While it might not have been dealt with in the D&aacute;il, not everything happens in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, made that point about the previous amendment.  There are some enlightened people in here who have a different view on things.  We saw it differently.  <\/p><p>I am not ruling out Fianna F&aacute;il supporting the next one based on my engagement and conversation.  I took the trouble to send this to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin this morning before I left here.  I am sorry I did not send it earlier.  Perhaps I should have used some more of my lobbying skills to meet him and some other officials within the party earlier.  Anyway, I will make my case here and try to convince people.  Politicians cannot be above the law.  It is that simple.  I discussed this issue after the last time this Bill was debated in this House.  I thought about it and sought advice.  We need to be very clear.  I am interested to hear what the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has to say.  He did say that he would reflect on it and he may read something into the record today that I would be interested to study.  The amendment I have moved pertains to section 17(4).  I will read it out for clarity.  It proposes, on page 18, between lines 16 and 22, to delete the following: <\/p><blockquote>other than an office as&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(ii) a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(iii) a member of the European Parliament who is such a member by virtue of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, or<br \/><br \/>(iv) a member of a local authority.<\/blockquote> <p>I appreciate there may be divided views in this House and there may even be divided constitutional and legal views and opinions.  It is important, however, that this matter is debated.  As the Bill stands, there is a provision for a court - after a person has been convicted on indictment and in addition to any custodial or any non-custodial sentence issued - &quot;to make an order prohibiting the person from seeking to hold or occupy any office, position or employment as an Irish official&quot;.  An &quot;Irish official&quot; is defined in section 2 of the Bill as including:<\/p><blockquote>(d) the Attorney General,<br \/><br \/>(e) the Comptroller and Auditor General,<br \/><br \/>(f) the Director of Public Prosecutions,<br \/><br \/>(g) a judge of a court in the State,<br \/><br \/>(h) an arbitrator, including any member of an arbitral board, panel or tribunal, in arbitral proceedings governed by the law of the State,<br \/><br \/>(i) a member of a jury in court proceedings (whether civil or criminal) in the State or in an inquest held under the Coroners Act 1962,<br \/><br \/>(j) an officer, director, employee or member of an Irish public body (including a member of a local authority),<br \/><br \/>(k) any other office holder appointed under an enactment who is remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and who is independent in the performance of the functions of that office, or<br \/><br \/>(l) any other person employed by or acting for or on behalf of the public administration of the State. <\/blockquote> <p>In Schedule 1 to the Bill, there is an exhaustive list of who is included in the definition of &quot;an Irish public body&quot;.  It includes:<\/p><blockquote>(a) a Department of State, including, as respects any particular Department of State, any office or body not otherwise standing specified in or under this Schedule in relation to which functions are vested in the Minister of the Government having charge of that Department of State;<br \/><br \/>(b) the Office of the President;<br \/><br \/>(c) the Office of the T&aacute;naiste;<br \/><br \/>(d) the Office of the Attorney General;<br \/><br \/>(e) the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General;<br \/><br \/>(f) the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions;<br \/><br \/>(g) the Office of the Ombudsman;<br \/><br \/>(h) the Houses of the Oireachtas Service;<br \/><br \/>(i) the Courts Service;<br \/><br \/>(j) a local authority;<br \/><br \/>(k) the Health Service Executive;<br \/><br \/>(l) the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<br \/><br \/>(m) the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate;<br \/><br \/>(n) the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission;<br \/><br \/>(o) the Policing Authority;<br \/><br \/>(p) the Criminal Assets Bureau;<br \/><br \/>(q) the National Asset Management Agency;<br \/><br \/>(r) the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland;<br \/><br \/>(s) the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission;<br \/><br \/>(t) an Bord Plean&aacute;la;<br \/><br \/>(u) the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<\/blockquote> <p>I want to be specific in reading this.  It is important that we set the record right here and that we do not have any distortion or misunderstanding when we leave here and suddenly ask what are we talking about.  There are only three amendments and as there is time for this business, I do not see why we should not be specific and set out our case.  The Schedule continues by listing:<\/p><blockquote>(v) a body, organisation or group established---(i) by or under any enactment (other than the Companies Act 2014), or<br \/><br \/>(ii) under the Companies Act 2014, in pursuance of powers conferred by or under another enactment, and financed wholly or partly by means of moneys provided, or loans made or guaranteed, by a Minister of the Government or the issue of shares held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government;(w) a company a majority of the shares in which are held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government;<br \/><br \/>(x) any other body, organisation or group appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government.<\/blockquote> <p>Under section 17(5)(a), all these people, the categories of whom are vast in nature, if convicted of an offence could be prevented from retaining their position or any other position in any of the above bodies or public bodies:<\/p><blockquote>if the court is satisfied that to do so is&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) in the interests of justice, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) in the interests of maintaining or restoring public confidence in the public administration of the State.<\/blockquote> <p>It is important that these full provisions be read into the record because, crucially, under section 17(4)(c), the persons it does not include are:<\/p><blockquote>(i) a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(ii) a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann,<br \/><br \/>(iii) a member of the European Parliament who is such a member by virtue of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, or<br \/><br \/>(iv) a member of a local authority.<\/blockquote> <p>How can we say that every person is treated equally under the law if, under the broad definition I have outlined today, effectively a secretary who is convicted for a corrupt offence could see him or herself prevented for up to ten years for working in any public office.  A politician, however, convicted for that same offence could put himself or herself up for election.  I have heard the arguments about constitutional conflict and around the Constitution.  The public do not always know what politicians are about.  I do not think we can put it down to there being constitutional issues in respect of this issue.  If there are, I want to hear them and I want to hear them here today.  <\/p><p>If the Minister is constrained by the advice from the Attorney General - as he may say to us, I do not know, and I will not pre-empt what he might say - then I would like to hear what the constitutional constraints are.  Equally, if it is the Attorney General's advice that including elected persons within the definition of the public official is unconstitutional, then I think we should at least have a discussion about amending the Constitution.  I await the Minister's response and I thank the Members for indulging me in that rather long introduction.  However, it was important to put it right for the record of the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#R00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I raised this matter first on Second Stage and I spoke to my colleague and friend, Senator Boyhan, about it and got his support for an amendment.

He said:<\/p><blockquote>Senators Norris and Boyhan stated that public representatives will not be subject to the offences or penalties under this Bill.  That is not accurate.  Under the Bill, the only penalty that does not apply to public representatives is the prohibition to seek another office in the future.  I am happy to debate the detail of this measure in the context of an amendment on Committee Stage. <\/blockquote><p>We put such an amendment down.  <br\/><br\/>I should say that I spoke to my assistant, who is absolutely wonderful, and gave her a copy of the Bill which I had marked up from page 18, to delete everything from line 16 after &quot;as an Irish official&quot; down to line 23. <br\/><br\/>However, somehow the amendment that was put down was as follows: &quot;In page 19, to delete lines 17 to 23&quot;.  There was a mistake from my office in the page number stated and the amendment would not make sense if it related to page 19.  I do not know what happened.  I put my amendment in immediately and arguably it should have been the first to be listed, although I am very happy for Senator Boyhan to take up the matter. <br\/><br\/>We do need a situation where, as Senator Boyhan said, politicians are not above the law.  Do we really want people in the D&aacute;il or Seanad who have been convicted of corruption?  Do we want corrupt politicians in this country?  The public is already very suspicious of politicians who have the lowest levels of trust among the public with the exception, I am glad to say, of journalists whose rating is even lower, and so they should be.  We already have evidence from the other House of people against whom grave suspicions have been raised by various tribunals, who were elected and, indeed top the poll, because they are very good constituency workers.  There was no criminal finding but it does suggest that such a finding could be made against a public official.<br\/><br\/>I remember former Ministers being convicted in the courts and I do not think that they are the kind of people we want in Parliament.  I really do not.  Does the Minister want these sorts of people in the D&aacute;il or Seanad?  Do we want as Members people who have been convicted of corrupt offences?  On matters such as the Constitution and democracy, the argument holds equally well for all the other people who are excluded, it does not operate only for politicians.  This Bill, as it stands, is making a special case for politicians.  I would also be interested to know what the Fianna F&aacute;il position is and whether it will support this amendment.  I put it to my friends and colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il that they, like everyone else, will be against corruption in Irish public life.  Do they want a situation where we are institutionalising it and allow politicians alone to be excluded from the penalties in this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#R00400","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>This is a fascinating debate and is a fascinating issue to tease out.  There is no doubting the sincerity with which Senator Boyhan and his colleagues have brought forward this amendment.  Senator Boyhan is correct that in this House, he is someone who engages, who listens, seeks views and guidance and is not dogmatic in the views or proposals he puts forward.<\/p> <p>Having listened to the debate, Sinn F&eacute;in also has concerns on the constitutionality of this amendment.  We may not have to die on a ditch at this point and we can have the opportunity now to listen to the various views of Members and the Minister.  <\/p> <p>There is a fundamental issue where a culture has prevailed in the politics of this State where individuals are regarded as being all right and a bit of a rogue.  There is also a broader question of how we as a society think that it is okay to elect someone to political office and public life in that case.  I agree with much of what the Senator said.  It is not the case that all the people who found themselves in those political positions have not been convicted, but they were in the political positions by dint of the people who elected them.  Other legislation and aspects of our politics can be examined in the context of how we ensure that the controversies which have bedevilled this State, in terms of white collar crime and corruption, can be challenged in broader society.  People would then know that there was some transparency around candidates' records or their pasts when they go forward.  I think the Senator is on shaky ground on this and that there are questions regarding the constitutionality of such an amendment.  At this stage, I am reluctant to support the amendment without having teased those matters out for a later stage.  I am keen to hear the Minister's thoughts and those of colleagues.  <\/p> <p>I think it is reasonable that if any Member of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament was found guilty by a court of law under this Act that he or she would be disbarred from public office for ten years, and I would suggest that in some cases, ten years would not be enough.  I just do not know if we are that far yet but maybe with the Minister's co-operation and that of others we can navigate a way through this which gets the right amendment and goes beyond rhetoric to also filter into society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#S00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I am fascinated by this debate.  I remember in the mid-1990s, having this very discussion as a politics student in UCD when the former Member of this House, Senator Maurice Manning, lectured in that Department.  It was before any of what we know now had emerged, it would have been in 1993 or 1994.  The first time I was ever in the Seanad Chamber was when I visited with my class with Maurice Manning.<\/p> <p>Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I am conflicted in that it is a very good amendment in what it seeks to achieve but one can also have miscarriages of justice.  There could be a situation where people were convicted of corruption and ten years later, they might be able to prove their innocence and in the meantime, they had been denied the opportunity of seeking a mandate from their constituents.  <\/p> <p>Democracy is something that we in this country treasure.  It is a difficult matter if the people choose to give someone a mandate.  One might argue that a person having been convicted of corruption should be banned for life, but on the other hand, if one truly believes in democracy, the democratic process and universal suffrage, who am I to say that the person they vote for is not suitable?  I might believe that but the people who vote for this person may not agree.  Sometimes we have to accept the will of the people.  On Friday week, whatever the result, we as politicians will respect and accept the will of the people.<\/p> <p>A better way to deal with this issue would be for the people who abhor corruption to put candidates up against people who have been found to have been corrupt and for the political system not to select candidates who are found to be corrupt.  There is nothing to stop people from standing as an Independent but they should not stand as a candidate from a registered political party.  <\/p> <p>I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The motivation behind the amendment is 100% on the ball, but we have to consider the democratic process, the secrecy of the ballot box, the notion of respecting democracy and ultimately accepting - not necessarily respecting - a mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#S00300","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Boyhan and Norris for coming back to this issue, which was referred to at an earlier Stage.  The amendment relates to the provision in section 17(4)(c) where a court in imposing a sentence on a person for an offence under the Act may make an order which will in essence prohibit that person from seeking to hold or occupy any office, position or employment as an Irish official for up to ten years.<\/p><p>I agree with much of what has been said.  It is entirely reasonable to seek to exclude from public office somebody found guilty of corruption.  The United Nations Convention against Corruption requires Ireland to give due consideration to such a measure.  The penalty may be imposed where a court is satisfied as to a number of things.  It is in the interests of justice and in the interests of restoring public confidence in the public administration of the State.  However, it is the court that must be satisfied.<\/p><p>The Bill as it stands contains a number of exceptions.  It states that nobody should be prohibited from seeking office as a Deputy, Senator, Member of the European Parliament or member of a local authority.  I understand Senators Boyhan and Norris would like to remove these exceptions.  There are sound constitutional reasons for having these exceptions.  I refer to Article 16.1 of the Constitution which states:<\/p><blockquote>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/blockquote> <p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann is dealt with in Article 18.2 which states:<\/p><blockquote>A person to be eligible for membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann must be eligible to become a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/blockquote> <p>There is a direct relationship and consequence.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Norris for going back to the earlier debate because it is important in considering where we are here.  I admit there was an element of confusion during the Second Stage debate, as Senator Norris acknowledges.  There was some confusion that the exceptions may only apply to politicians.  I want to be absolutely clear about the penalties under the Bill.  Included in the penalties are imprisonment; fines; and forfeiting the gift, advantage or consideration.  This, of course, applies to all citizens and all residents, including politicians.  Where the penalty is forfeiture of office, this can only apply to State employees, some of whom have been mentioned by Senator Boyhan - civil servants, public servants and elected politicians.  However, it will not apply to a small number of particular posts listed in the Bill as relevant Irish officials.  I will address this when discussing the next amendment, where it may be more relevant.<\/p><p>Where the penalty is prohibition from seeking public office for up to ten years, this again can apply to all Irish citizens and residents, including politicians.  Anybody with a corruption conviction can be prohibited from seeking employment as a public servant or civil servant, or from seeking a particular public post for a period of up to ten years.  The exception here is that nobody can be stopped from standing for election as a Deputy, Senator, MEP or member of a local authority.  It is not my intention here to unduly interfere with the electoral process.<\/p><p>I have been strongly advised that putting a prohibition order on somebody from seeking election would raise constitutional issues.  When the public are voting and a particular candidate has a conviction for corruption, this will obviously be a matter of public record.  The voter will make a choice on the basis of that record.  I do not accept that a serious corruption offence contrary to this legislation would be secret or would be conducted in a way that the electorate in any constituency - D&aacute;il or Seanad - would not be aware of this.  It would be a matter of public record and I have no doubt that the issue would be very much in play in an election campaign for the D&aacute;il, Seanad, European Parliament or whatever.<\/p><p>Where the penalty is forfeiture of office, it can and does apply to elected politicians - Deputies, Members of the European Parliament, members of a local authority and Senators.  The difficulty arises at the following or subsequent election at which that person may wish to seek an electoral mandate.  That is where the issue of the Constitution comes into play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#T00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I have heard what the Minister has said and I know the dilemma he faces.

I do not expect him to tell us things he cannot tell us; he is constrained in what he can say here.  However, everyone has to be held to account equally before the law whether they are citizens or politicians - I do not wish to draw any distinction between them.<\/p> <p>I am somewhat disappointed that so few Members are present; they may have other business to attend to.  I have heard what some of the Senators have said.  It is a sensitive issue and needs those from all parties and none to look at it, but the current situation is not good enough.  <\/p> <p>I draw Members attention to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service digest on the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill 2017.  The team in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service do a great job.  I do not know how many people use them, but I use them every day.  I rely on their independent validation and scrutiny of legislation.  It is a real tool to assist us in our work.<\/p> <p>An appendix at the end of the digest draws attention to the international anti-corruption conventions, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the Council of Europe Conventions on Corruption, Civil Law Convention on Corruption, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and a range of others.  It deals with the requirements in the conventions we have signed up to.<\/p> <p>When reading the digest, I wondered if we have forgotten about the recommendations from the report of the Mahon tribunal.  Have we learned anything from that tribunal?  Have we studied all the politicians who were hauled before that tribunal?  I accept there were ramifications for some and others for various reasons got off.  There were reviews and subsequently other decisions were made.  We spent a lot of money and saw many politicians appear before the Mahon tribunal over irregularities.<\/p> <p>Are these people suitable to be in public office?  The Minister is telling me it is acceptable to allow them to run in a general election and the people will know.  The people do not know a lot of things about a lot of politicians - including some who are in here.  They do not necessarily need to know.  There are people who have a considerable amount of money and can well afford to fund very successful advertising and propaganda campaigns to promote themselves.  All this gets a bit lost.

That is what I am taking away from it.  The Mahon tribunal discussed it.  We know what international best practice is.  I understand the Minister's dilemma and if he is telling me there are constitutional problems, we need to consider amending the Constitution.  If the Minister is stating we are constrained by the Constitution and if the Constitution is not serving us well, perhaps that is another constitutional amendment that should be on the list of proposals the Government might consider putting to the people.  I am not prepared to accept as a Member of the House, however, what the Minister proposes in this Bill.  If the Government comes back and says there is an anomaly or problem and that we are constrained by the Constitution, that is fair enough.  If it is the case, however, let us do something about it.  Let us identify it as a difficulty and do something.<\/p><p>I came to the House today to decide to call a vote on this but I am not going to.  I have heard what the Minister has said and I have heard the Senators who have spoken.  However, I ask that we come together.  This is an appeal to the House and to the D&aacute;il.  I ask that we look at this again on the next Stage and come up with something better than this.  This does not go far enough in my view but, ultimately, that is a matter for Members to decide.  The Members here will debate this issue in the coming days in the media.  I have no doubt about that.  Ultimately, we will have to make our own cases and say where we stand on this issue.  I will continue to be active on this.  I will take it to Government and to others.  I will put pen to paper this very day and write to a number of people, including the Taoiseach, to ask that this particular matter be given a focus.  As I understand it and having regard to what the Minister has said today, this does not go far enough.  Every Member of the Oireachtas of all parties and none must address this issue.  We must be frank and honest and put appropriate legislation in place.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reflect on this as he said he would with the previous amendment and bring this back on Report Stage to see what can be done.  In the meantime, I make the commitment that I will not be found wanting in lobbying and engaging with all political groupings in the Houses and in government to see if we can revisit this particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#T00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I am interested in the fact that the Minister quoted the Constitution and referred to incapacity by law.

I will outline the context arising from Committee Stage of the Bill.  These amendments have been grouped together as amendments Nos. 7, 9 and 10 relate to section 4 and provide for guiding principles for children.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are included in this group as the definitions referred to here also relate to terms used in the amendments proposed to section 4.  As amendments Nos. 11 and 12 deal with definitions they have also been added to this group.  I will start by discussing amendments Nos. 7 and 9, which are Government amendments, and amendment No. 10, which contains an alternative text proposed by Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson.<\/p> <p>Section 4 of the 2001 Act is entitled \"Best interests\" and covers both adults and children.  As it is proposed to remove the reference to best interests for adults, we must now reinsert the best interests provision for children in the 2001 Act.  In the amendments I am putting forward, I propose to delete the full text of section 4 and replace it with very similar provisions.  Deputy Browne had originally proposed to place this text in section 25 of the 2001 Act.  As section 25 only applies to involuntary patients and as the Deputy and I want this section to apply to all persons treated under the 2001 Act, we are suggesting instead that this text be added as a new section 4A of the 2001 Act, immediately after the new section entitled \"Guiding principles for adults\".<\/p> <p>While I had been inclined to accept and, indeed, add to Deputy Browne's text, legal concerns were raised with my officials by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC.  The OPC advised that some of the proposed provisions regarding children may impinge upon the constitutional rights of children and their parents and guardians.  It further advised that it is imperative that the Department be satisfied that these provisions correctly address the rights of the various relevant parties and they should dovetail appropriately with all applicable legislation.  In particular, the OPC asked that my officials confirm that they were satisfied that the proposed changes would not have any unintended negative effects on child-related legislation across other Departments.<\/p> <p>Although my Department supported the amendments from a policy point of view and was unable to identify any obvious negative impacts, I am obliged to pay appropriate attention to the legal concerns raised and may only propose amendments that we are satisfied will not have unintended legal or constitutional consequences.  The Government amendment to this section of the Bill, therefore, mirrors the current text of section 4 but proposes deleting references to the rights of the child to be heard having regard to his age and maturity.  Senators Ardagh, Swanick and Wilson have proposed amendments that are broader in scope but, given the legal concerns expressed, I propose that the House will agree to Government amendments Nos. 7 and 9 in order to allow the issues raised to be considered more fully.<\/p> <p>Regarding Government amendment No. 3 and amendment No. 4 in the names of Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson, the former relates to definitions in the 2001 Act.  The Government is proposing to add to the definitions in the Bill and to rephrase the definition of \"voluntary patient\".  Amendment No. 3 adds a definition for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and one for guiding principles in addition to the rephrased definition in respect of voluntary patients, also to be included in section 2 of the 2001 Act.  Amendment No. 4 differs only slightly from the Government's amendment with regard to the definition of \"guiding principles\".  We state that the guiding principles should be construed in accordance with section 4 of the 2001 Act, as my Department is now proposing, that is, guiding principles for adults but retaining best interests for children as per Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Amendment No. 4 retains a reference to guiding principles in respect of children, so the definition proposed includes a reference not just to section 4 of the Act but also the new proposed section 4A.  This is important because if the House decides to accept Government amendments Nos. 7 and 9, the logical consequence is that Senators should also agree to amendment No. 3.  On the other hand, if amendment No. 10 is accepted, it follows that Senators should also choose amendment No. 4 because the definition it contains flows directly from the text of amendment No. 10.  When the amendments are being put to the House, I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to bear this linkage in mind.<\/p> <p>The same text has been submitted by both the Government and Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson in amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  Both amendments can be accepted.<\/p> <p>Before I conclude and in case this gets lost in the technical discussion about accepting or rejecting numbered amendments, I remind Senators of the consequences of amending the definition of \"voluntary patient\".  There is no disagreement on this.  The definition in the 2001 Act is inadequate and must be amended to ensure that, in future, a voluntary patient is a person who formally consents to admission and treatment.  The reference to consent is missing from the current definition.  However, this change cannot proceed without any associated changes being introduced.  The suggested definition of \"voluntary patient\" would immediately result in some people being denied inpatient treatment.  Such persons would be those who lack capacity and who, therefore, cannot provide consent.  However, while they would need inpatient treatment, they would not be sufficiently mentally ill to warrant admission as involuntary patients.  As they lack capacity and cannot consent to treatment, they could not be voluntary patients but, equally, if they do not suffer from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the Act, they could also not be detained.  Such patients are sometimes referred to as the compliant incapacitated.  Before any new definition of \"voluntary patient\" which explicitly refers to consent commences, we must also include lawful measures which ensure that at no stage would the compliant incapacitated be denied treatment.<\/p> <p>In this regard, my Department is currently working on the deprivation of liberty safeguards that would be intended to allow persons without capacity to consent to be lawfully admitted to residential care and to psychiatric hospitals for treatment.  It is essential that the change of the definition of \"voluntary patient\" occurs simultaneously with the commencement of provisions relating to deprivation of liberty.  Draft heads of a Bill relating to deprivation of liberty safeguards were the subject of a recent public consultation and the views put forward during that consultation are now being considered by a working group based in the Department.  I expect that the deprivation of liberty Bill will be presented to the Oireachtas as soon a possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Finally, I will move on to amendments Nos. 11 and 12.  The Government and Senators Swanick, Ardagh and Wilson have submitted amendments to sections 5 and 6 of the Bill, which seek to delete both sections.  At my meeting with Deputy Browne last week I explained that, while he had put forward a reasonable proposal to define consent for the purposes of a voluntary patient, the legal advice available to me is to the effect that consent is a feature of common law.  On that basis, including a specific definition in this Bill might have unintended consequences in other legislation which also deals with consent.  It is appropriate, therefore, that sections 5 and 6 be deleted and no replacement text is required here.<\/p><p>In summary, I appreciate this is complex and technical.  If the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are not withdrawing their amendments, I am prepared to withdraw the Government amendments Nos. 3, 7 and 9 and, as a result, I will not object to amendments Nos. 4 and 10, which are consequential to the Senators' proposals.<\/p><p>The second group of amendments are amendment Nos. 5 and 6 and if Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are not withdrawing their amendment No. 6, I am prepared to withdraw the Government amendment No. 5 and I will not object to amendment No. 6.

congratulate my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and the Deputy who has joined us on their work on this very important Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting the Fianna F&aacute;il amendments.  Our amendment is an amendment to section 15 of the principal Act.  It seeks to resolve an issue raised by a recent Court of Appeal ruling in the case of AB <i>v<\/i>. St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital.  The court ruled that allowing the extension of involuntary detention in a mental health facility by 12 months after a prior extension of six months was a violation of the rights of the patient.  The 12-month period was deemed too long to be ordered without a review.  The 2015 expert review of the Mental Health Act 2001, which was supported by the coalition Mental Health Reform, identified this issue and called for a reduction.  The expert review called for a maximum of nine months, but there is real concern that this would also not be constitutionally acceptable.  Patients deserve to have a right to review and to appeal their detention.  To say that a patient must be detained for 12 months without review is akin to an admission of defeat, especially when we are seeking to move to a community-based model in line with the A Vision for Change policy.  While some patients will need acute and even extended hospital care, this must be done with great care for the rights of the patient and always with a view to discharge and continued care and recovery in an outpatient setting.  I call on and urge all Members to support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#Z02700","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the proposed amendment.  It has been proposed as a direct result of the important judgment of the Court of Appeal given on 4 May 2018.  As Senator Warfield said, this judgment declared that renewal orders by mental health tribunals under section 15(3) of the Mental Health Act 2001, which include both six-month and 12-month orders, breaches Article 40.4.1&deg; of the Constitution.  It is important to confirm that this declaration of unconstitutionality by the Court of Appeal stands suspended until 8 November 2018, which allows the necessary time to give full and proper consideration to this complex matter.<\/p> <p>While I fully accept that in proposing this amendment, the Senators are trying to be proactive in light of the judgment, I believe that we must first fully understand and agree what exactly is required of us as legislators, to ensure that we can comply with all aspects of the judgment and introduce the appropriate changes in this regard.  For example, it appears from our initial engagement with our legal advisers that the decision of the Court of Appeal extends to orders of up to six and 12 months.  In such cases, the amendment as proposed will not address the judgment.  We also need to carefully consider the comments made in the judgments of both the High Court and the Court of Appeal to the effect that a person should have a further right of review if detained for such a period, and how provision for this might be worded.  In addition, the position regarding existing patients needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>The foregoing points all need to be carefully considered and it is for this reason that the court gave the Government six months to remedy the situation.  I can confirm that my Department has already undertaken consultation as to next steps and I expect to be able to propose an appropriate way forward in the very short term.  We therefore must oppose this amendment, as the amendment as phrased will not answer all the questions raised in the judgment of the Court of Appeal.  I stress again to the Senator that in light of the recent court judgment I know where he and the Sinn F&eacute;in party are coming from but notwithstanding their good intentions, it is simply unhelpful from a technical and legal point of view to try to address that in this Bill in the short text of this amendment.  There are also significant concerns around the six-month issue.  As we need to nail that down before we deal with this, unfortunately we cannot support the amendment at this point.  If possible, I ask for the amendment to be withdrawn to allow the Oireachtas to engage more fully in this particular issue, which is obviously of huge concern given the court case.  That is a matter for the Senators to decide but I request them to withdraw it if appropriate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#Z02800","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Given the delays we have had so often in people accessing appropriate mental health supports and in the roll-out of resources and key areas, there is an opportunity to address this issue now, in this excellent Bill that has been put forward.

Given that the direction of the court judgment is clear and that it is clear from it that 12 months is not appropriate, we do not have to wait until the last moment to change this.  We do not have to wait until November.  Realistically, given how long it takes for legislation to come through, I do not believe there will be more amending legislation going through in time for a November deadline, as set by the courts.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to take the opportunity presented now to take a positive step in the right direction by accepting what I believe is a constructive, legally sound suggestion from Sinn F&eacute;in and agreeing to the amendment.  If we need to review the six-month period, it can be done afterwards, in the longer term.  Let us not arrive at circumstances in November in which we have failed, when given a clear opportunity, to take into account the direction given in terms of constitutional opinion.  I have noted when much weaker constitutional concerns have allowed or stymied action.  This is a clear ruling constitutionally.  I do not see any justification for the Minister of State not taking a step.  There is certainly no opinion anywhere from anybody that the period of 12 months will need to be defended.  I cannot see the logic in not accepting the amendment at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#Z02900","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I support my colleague in her assertion that this will be the only mental health Bill that will go through the Houses in the lifetime of this Government.

The reason we make laws here is to prevent confusion over rights and to ensure that those rights are upheld without people having to go to court.  The Government has guidance on what it should and should not do but it is important that we provide clarity in legislation on the rights of individuals.  There is an opportunity to do that now.

The Oireachtas deals with legislation every day.  I have a responsibility, not an option, to deal with this matter within six months.  It is an order of the court.  These Houses, not only me, must adhere to it.  There are a number of complex issues, however, and these have been addressed in the judgments.  Anybody who read the judgment of the Court of Appeal or the previous judgments would recognise the matter is not so simplistic that we can do justice to it today.  All I ask is that we, as an Oireachtas, be responsible and allow the time needed.  It is not about the here and now.  We can amend legislation at any stage and put forward proposals.  In the spirit of co-operation and to do justice to Deputy Browne's Bill, I ask for unanimous support and that we work collectively without division.  I appeal again to the House to allow me, my officials, the Department and Members to engage constructively.  I can give more detail on the complexities arising over this issue.  We will have to come back to this.  All I can assure the House is that this measure will not address the issue.

The possibility of a review of someone's detention at six months is important in a holistic sense in terms of reintegration into a community.  The detention is not a prison sentence.  It is not rocket science to contend that someone should have the status of their health reviewed on an ongoing basis, be it weekly or monthly, never mind after six months.  This should not even require legislation.  It should be normal procedure to review a patient's mental health status on an ongoing basis but the Minister of State keeps talking about complexities.  I wonder why now is not the time for him to outline the complexities associated with a person having his or her detention reviewed independently at six months.  What exactly are the complexities involved in ensuring that someone has intervention at the earliest opportunity in their mental healthcare?  When someone is discharged from detention, it does not mean they cannot still have ongoing involvement in community services, be it at six months or 12 months.  One does not cut off healthcare at that stage.  My point is on integration in respect of holistic and community care.  We closed institutions in this country and our streets became our asylums and hotels our hostels.<\/p> <p>I do not see the complexity in not further institutionalising people for up to 12 months when integration could be allowed for by having an earlier point of contact.  Could the Minister of State talk us through why this would not just be a slam dunk?

Mental Health Reform's note also states that individuals who are currently in long-stay in hospital could end up discharged from regulated inpatient services to unregulated community-based mental health services if the gap in legislation is not addressed within the next six months.

I think the Oireachtas can be proud of what we have done in the area of special education.  Despite the very difficult environment in which we have been working in recent years, we have consistently increased the resources in the area.  Since 2011, the provision in special education has been increased by about 43% and well over &euro;1.5 billion of the education budget goes into special education provision, which is considerably larger than, for example, the allocation to higher education.  We have made a very serious policy commitment to provide integrated opportunities for people with special education needs to succeed and to progress through education.<\/p> <p>I do not want to spend too much time on the type of provision but basically we seek to have an inclusive and integrated model wherever we can.  In excess of 60% of children with ASD are in mainstream classes, approximately 20% are in special classes within mainstream schools, and 20% are in special schools.  That tends to be the distribution.  There is clearly a hope that we can have as many as possible in mainstream education.<\/p> <p>We now have more than 14,000 SNAs, an increase of 33% since 2011.  We have approximately 13,500 special education teacher posts, representing a similar increase since 2011.  Special classes are becoming more prevalent and the number has increased by considerably in excess of 100%, from 548 in 2011 to more than 1,300 now, which is a very substantial expansion.  Initially much of that was at primary level, but increasingly we are seeing that move on to a very significant expansion of ASD units at second level.  We have 124 special schools with about 7,500 students.  As Senators know, the pupil-teacher ratio in special units is much more favourable at 6:1, with two SNAs.  These are very specialist support areas.  That expansion has required the Department to invest in facilities to back that up.<\/p> <p>I know the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill is yet to come to the Seanad.  That Bill allows either Tusla or the NCSE to require a school to take an individual student.  On Report Stage we will introduce an amendment allowing the NCSE after a number of steps to require a school, by way of ministerial order, to open an ASD unit or a special unit.  That is a new power to ensure we can continue to expand the provision.<\/p> <p>We may also make changes to the way we allocate money.  In September, we introduced a new model for allocating resource teachers.  The aim of the model was to frontload into schools the number of resource teachers they would need based on the profile of individual schools.  We put in extra resources to ensure we could do that in a way that no school would lose.  That is the first time we moved from the need to have a diagnostic report to trigger resource teaching.  Instead we are gearing up the schools based on the expected profile of individual schools and not only does the school now have more resources to meet the need, but it has moved away from this labelling approach.  While labelling was unnecessary in many cases, sometimes diagnoses are very helpful for teaching.  The model has moved away from unnecessary labelling where it could be avoided.  It has also promoted more of a whole-school approach to integrating special education.  It gives school principals more discretion to decide whether one-to-one, group or mainstream teaching should be used to provide that extra support.  I have visited schools using this new approach and it has been very warmly received.  People tell me it is not only good for the children with special needs, but that it is good for the entire school and gives a much more integrated approach to delivery.<\/p> <p>Senators will also be interested in the area of special needs provision.  For many years this provision has been allocated very late in the year, often in June at the end of the school year.  The system was that the Minister had to go back to Cabinet to get approval for a new financial allocation; it had not been built into the Estimates.  This year, for the first time, we have built it into the Estimates and we hope to be able to announce the allocation to schools within the next few days, allowing for much better planning.<\/p> <p>The NCSE is close to completion of its work to review the special need assistance programme to ascertain if we are delivering to meet the children's needs in the best possible way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have done much work on this.  The recent pilot which we announced on Monday gives an indication of the direction of their thinking.  This year, for 75 schools and 75 preschools in the west Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare area, CHO 7, we will introduce a scheme whereby we embed speech and language resource and occupational therapy resource within a network of schools.  They will service a network of 150 institutions including preschools, special schools and primary and secondary schools.  Based on good exemplars, we believe that not only can better one-to-one support be provided, but one can develop programmes whereby teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs and parents can provide continuity between one-to-one sessions that a child might have with a speech and language therapist.  That can transform the learning environment by establishing continuity rather than occasion access to the therapists followed by a long gap and a drop off and so on; it will integrate the therapy.  While it is a pilot, it gives a direction of the thinking coming from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that we can do better if we bring new expertise to bear within the school setting on a professional partnership basis between the SNAs, teachers and parents with a professional, allowing us to better deliver to students' needs.  That is in progress.  Based on the success of the resource teaching model, which has been well received, we hope to develop it over time.  <\/p><p>I mentioned the admissions Bill, to which we are making changes.  <\/p><p>The NCSE is the independent leader and it decides where a child is looking for a school place.  It uses its special education needs organisers, SENOs, to support parents in getting access to the appropriate setting.  If, for any reason, they do not get an appropriate setting, home schooling opportunities are available.  Some 1,700 pupils avail of home tuition although generally children wait for a suitable school placement.  We are taking new powers to support the NCSE in making sure that schools will develop.  We are very determined that no school will turn away a child because of their special education need or decline to participate in providing a special unit if that school is the most appropriate location for delivery.<\/p><p>The other service which is key to this is the national education psychological service.  Under the programme for Government, we have committed to expanding this service.  It is a really important piece of the infrastructure.  We currently have 180 whole-time equivalent psychologists in the service.  We are steadily expanding the service with the development of well-being programmes in each school.<\/p><p>The final piece of the jigsaw is school transport.  That is a very significant investment.  About 12,000 children with special needs avail of the school transport scheme at a cost of &euro;88 million.  We make a significant investment there so that children have transport to the most suitable school.<\/p><p>It is an area in which we have done a lot.  One of the ambitions for the future is to really focus to make sure that we also deliver on good outcomes.  Our inspection service show very good methodologies being deployed.  We need to ensure that as we deepen the resource commitment and improve its allocation that we see gains in children staying on more, developing their independence skills, and progressing to other opportunities.  That is an area where we need to do more analysis and develop the methodologies to record that progress and establish good objective benchmarks for evaluating policy initiatives and alternatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#JJ00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his contribution.  As the Minister noted, some good progress have been made in special education provision.  Fianna F&aacute;il is very proud of the part it has played in this along with others.  It is vitally important that every child who goes through the school gates on their first day is able to maximise their potential so that no child is left behind.<\/p> <p>My contribution here is on the provision of special needs assistance.  I heard the Minister say that he expects to make an announcement on this in coming days which is very positive.  In the past, late announcements caused serious problems as I am sure the Minister will be aware.  It caused serious problems for boards of management, school principals, parents and for special needs assistants themselves.  It was the case that allocations were not announced until some schools had gone on holidays.  This was not satisfactory because boards of management had to be brought in during the summer holidays when people were away and it caused serious disruption.  Special needs assistants did not know whether they would be allocated to a particular school for the school year ahead or whether they would have to apply elsewhere.  Everyone was in limbo and it was not satisfactory.  I welcome the Minister having looked at the area and am glad that he will make an announcement this week or maybe early next week.  It is very positive and it would be uncharitable not to acknowledge that the Minister has taken on board the concerns of all the stakeholders in making that announcement.  <\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the delay in the construction of special needs schools.  I understand that commitments and promises were made to construct ten schools for the start of the 2016-2017 school year.  I understand that 70% of those schools have yet to move beyond the planning stage.  That is disappointing.  When we make commitments and promised to anyone, but especially to those in the area of special needs, it is important that we stand over those promises and deliver what we say we will.   Will the Minister make a comment on the status of those ten schools and what stage of construction they have reached when he sums up the debate?  As the Minister observed, the progress made in special needs provision is very positive.  There is much more that we can do but much progress has been made of which we can be proud.  Our children will be its beneficiaries.<\/p> <p>I now turn to school transport.  The Minister will not need me to remind him of the issues on this that all of us across the country encountered last year.  From what I hear, it might be even worse this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Perhaps when the Minister is summing up he might comment on his understanding of where the rural transport scheme is for all our students so that parents who had bad experiences last year will not have the same bad experiences this year.  Perhaps the Minister might give them some confidence as they look forward to the new academic year.  Will he also make a brief comment on capitation grants?  I know it is not directly under the umbrella of what we are talking about today but one could say that the funding of schools across the board affects all children regardless.  The capitation grants are becoming a serious issue for schools.  They are stretched to breaking point.  <\/p><p>The Department needs to step up and enhance its contribution.  That would take the pressure off school principals who are stressed wondering whether they are going to have the finances to keep functioning in the year ahead.  I refer to parents as well.  They are hard pressed enough without having to put their hands into their pockets to make contributions to make sure the lights stay on and there is heating for their children at school.  We might get some indication of the Minister's thoughts in that area as well.  I thank him for taking the time to come here today.  This is a good news story and great work has been done.  Everyone in both Houses can be very proud of our contribution.  However, we cannot rest on our hands.  There is always more we can and should do.  The ambition we have for all our children is that every child that goes through the school gate will maximise his or her potential by the time he or she leaves that school, whether that is primary, secondary or whatever level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#KK00200","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I have read the press releases in respect of speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy.  They are extremely welcome.  I want to seek a comment from the Minister on what we determine as special needs.  In the areas and schools that I most represent sometimes those special needs come in the form of trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, or behavioural difficulties due to the social environment.  These are sometimes separated as if these are problematic students rather than actually displaying behaviours based on the conditions in which they are living.<\/p> <p>These students often end up in resource classes.  A diversity of students end up in those resource classes.  Some of them have diagnoses for autistic spectrum disorders, ASD, and different learning difficulties.  There are, however, also students who are experiencing similar difficulties in school but do not necessarily come under that diagnosis.  What will be the role of the occupational therapists at primary and pre-school levels?  I am not sure if it will be at secondary level as well.  Will they look at the holistic needs of the students in respect of mental health and how that is impacting their school?  I recently spent the morning in Linn Dara school with students who are not in mainstream school any more.  They spoke very passionately about their negative experience of school.  I understand that schools are not resourced or trained to a level needed to deal with the level of difficulty that can be found in the classroom.  There are so many different needs.  <\/p> <p>How can we piece all of this together so that we can meet such a diverse range of needs within the mainstream school?  My own daughter went through secondary school with high anxiety.  That resulted in many mental health issues.  It was mentioned earlier that we do not want to be diagnosing people.  However, the diagnosis that we ended up with in the end possibly saved her life.  She is on the autistic spectrum.  We got that diagnosis after she had endured what felt like five hellish years in a school system that she did not understand.  She could not fit in or meet the requirements made of her in the classroom setting.  Schools such as the one my daughter went to are underresourced in respect of being able to send children for educational psychology assessments as well as to occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.  How can we increase the number of educational assessments of needs in children in such schools so that we can figure out the needs? <\/p> <p>We do not want to diagnose everybody, but in some cases a diagnosis can actually improve the experience of that child within school.  My daughter is now in Trinity College Dublin.  She feels a great difference in disability service provision and what is being provided for her in respect of accommodation and being able to sit her exams on her own.  If something as simple as that had been provided in the school system it would have made a massive difference to her performance during exam time.  She now gets to sit in a room on her own without those small distractions that would sometimes distract people on the spectrum.  <\/p> <p>On the recognition of special needs resource requirements for kids with dyscalculia - I have brought this up with the Minister, Deputy Bruton in the past - I feel it is something that is not getting much attention in the same way as dyslexia does.  We have a cohort of children in school that have a disability with mathematics.  It is not about how it is being taught to them.  It is not about their ability or how much work they have put into it.  It is an actual disability.  It is standing in the way of their progression into third level education because it is not being recognised to the same standard as dyslexia in respect of mathematics waivers at the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>Trinity College Dublin has a mathematics waiver, which is what allowed my daughter to go to college, but not all universities have mathematics waivers.  To get a mathematics waiver, an educational psychological assessment is needed.  If these were more available in some of the schools that do not have much resources - or the families do not have many resources - then we would see a much higher progression rate to third level, as indeed we would if we could recognise all the invisible disabilities that exist within second level education.  <\/p> <p>It is very important that we support children so that they are able to stay in mainstream school.  However, there is a gap when they leave school.  If they do not go to university, further education institutes do not have the same supports as the university sector.  I was alerted recently to a girl who had been accepted into Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  She has a disability.  When she tried to follow the next step in her education, she was told that the college was not required to meet the needs she had to allow her to study there.  In respect of further education, we can get children up to the point where they are 18 but we need to be able to enable progression into further education.  The university sector does quite well in respect of having resources for dealing with disabilities.  Community colleges, however, are not in that position.<\/p> <p>In respect of the units - I do not like calling them that - I am currently working on a very alarming case.  I will be in contact with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, when I have gathered the full evidence.  A child in Cork or Limerick - I will have to doublecheck my notes - has been sent home from a school unit.  There are only two children in that unit.  I think it can cater for up to ten children.  I will have to check my notes on that again.  The unit said that it could not meet that child's requirements.  It is a whole unit working with only two children.  It should have the ability to work with many more children.<\/p> <p>The unit told the mother that the child was not to come back to the special unit until he was medicated.  These are teaching professionals and special needs professionals nearly forcing a parent to medicate her child so he would be able to come back to the unit.  I wonder about the consistency across all the training in respect of people working in that area.  There is much amazing work being done but there are also gaps and we are failing many children.  This young boy, who is at the early stage of second level, cannot even access one of the units.  What stuck me was that this unit cannot meet his needs when it is not even at full capacity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wonder how it could meet the needs of all the children if it was at full capacity.  I wonder how much we are supporting the special needs units in carrying out their functions for kids that need extra support.  <\/p><p>The Joint Committee on Education and Skills yesterday heard submissions on something I was unaware of.  The discussion concerned sex education.  Inclusion Ireland came before the committee to talk about people with intellectual disabilities and how the education system is impacting them.  I was not aware that children in special schools with intellectual disabilities are taught at primary level right up to the age of 18.  We have not even reformed the education system to recognise that young people with intellectual disabilities are not eternal children.  They are going through teenage years and going into adolescence.  They would like to potentially have relationships, go into the workforce or live with some independence.  I wonder if this is an area the Minister has looked at when considering special education.  We have special schools that are teaching at primary level right up to when the child is 18.  We should create a system that allows children with special needs to go through the same age-appropriate education that kids in mainstream schools do, so that they have some chance to be at par with their peers when they eventually leave school or go into third level or further education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#LL00200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Senator Byrne, who is unavailable this afternoon.<\/p> <p>I would firstly like to commend the Minister on the fact that almost &euro;1.8 billion will be invested in special education this year, nearly a fifth of the overall education budget.  This has increased by 43% since 2011.<\/p> <p>Considerable work has already been undertaken, and is ongoing, in identifying the appropriate form and level of support for children with special educational needs.  It is critical that the optimal form of support is provided.  From September 2017 a new model for allocating special education teachers has been introduced for all mainstream primary and post-primary schools.  The special needs assistant, SNA, scheme was originally conceived as a model to provide assistance to children with significant care needs arising mainly from physical disabilities, in order to facilitate their participation in mainstream education, where possible.  In order to provide the best possible outcomes for children with special needs, for teaching and also for care needs, it is of the utmost importance that all special education schemes are monitored, regularly reviewed and revised, as necessary.  The outcomes for pupils must be captured in a meaningful way to ensure that the most appropriate form of support is provided to pupils with special educational needs in educational settings. <\/p> <p>I wish to address some points of concern raised by the Special Needs Parents Association.  Its members have raised the issue of sports.  They have also emphasised the importance of developing schemes based on children's needs rather than diagnosis.  Ensuring that no child is locked out of a service on the basis that his or her diagnosis does not fit a disability service criteria is obviously an issue of concern for all stakeholders.  The association is enthusiastically awaiting the roll-out of children's disability network teams across the country, which will cater for all children with complex needs, regardless of what type of school or preschool setting they are in.<\/p> <p>The association's vision for children's disability services, under the national reform programme progressing disability services for children and young people, is to establish children's disability network teams to provide therapeutic children for complex needs.  The vision encompasses the following: easy access to the services children need; fairness in providing services; and families, health services and schools working together to support children in developing their potential.  This vision will ensure that instead of trying to find their way through a maze of services, parents and health professionals will easily be able to find out where a child should be referred.  As much as any supports offered to children with special educational needs and disabilities are welcomed, there is some concern about disjointed policies, despite cross-departmental approaches.<\/p> <p>The reconfiguration of children's disability services was launched in 2010, but the lack of investment in therapists, infrastructure and industrial relations issues have stalled progress for the past eight years, with no new teams being formed since 2014.  As far as the Special Needs Parents Association is aware, no additional funding for therapists and support staff has been allocated more recently, but perhaps the Minister can respond to this.<\/p> <p>Another issue of concern is that competition between different parts of the HSE in recruiting therapists will be compounded by yet another programme opening up posts.  There may be a difficulty in getting therapists.  This alone will create a gap in current services caused by recruitment delays and existing vacant posts, which are already hard to fill. <\/p> <p>The universal therapy inputs into schools by building the capacity and knowledge of school staff.  This will undoubtedly show benefits and schools will feel more supported.  It is very positive that the Government is so committed to ensuring that children with special educational needs are given the opportunity to live independent lives and reach their full potential.  Significant resources are committed to supporting children with special needs.  This continued substantial investment in special education resources, which had been lacking for some years, has contributed to significant improvements, as the Minister has referred to.  Considerable work has already been undertaken, and is ongoing.  I wish the Minister continued success in that regard and thank him for attending. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#MM00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  I want to begin, if I may, by speaking about special needs assistants.  I commend the ongoing work and commitment of the Forsa trade union and its members, whose investment in this sector is second to none.  I want to applaud F&oacute;rsa's recent announcement that it intends to establish a professional institute which will provide ongoing support training for special needs assistants.  I think this is a really proactive move by the trade union movement, and shows its commitment to the sector and indeed to its members.<\/p> <p>Currently, neither the State nor the schools in which SNAs are based are providing the desired level of ongoing training.  Perhaps it would be appropriate to ask the Minister to consider whether he could provide public funds to F&oacute;rsa to invest in the workings of its new institute.  It would be the sort of innovative approach that I would certainly call for.  F&oacute;rsa's SNA institute will allow workers to underpin their experience and qualifications with up-to-date training in order to move a sector where precarious employment is still growing towards professionalisation.  There is a core of 60% of SNAs surveyed by Forsa who have been employed in the sector for over a decade.  However, of those surveyed, 82% still say that they would be interested in further training.  This demand must be met in some way, and obviously Forsa feels it needs to step in.<\/p> <p>As the Minister knows, Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called on the Government to make a number of specific changes concerning special needs assistants.  The State's record on publishing the annual SNA allocation in a timely fashion has been very poor over the last several years.  In fairness, the Minister has referred to this.  Each year, SNAs employed by the State have been left in the lurch as to whether they will have a job after the summer.  It is just not a situation that can be tolerated.  I welcome the Minister's indication that this year, I take it by the end of this month, people will know.  That is progress.  I need to acknowledge that.  To be fair, however, while it is a step in the right direction for the workers themselves, the Minister needs to look for his Department to do this by the end of March each year to give people adequate time to plan.  The Minister is clearly aware of the issue, and I would welcome a commitment to moving that deadline forward in future years.  <\/p> <p>This also speaks to the issue of job security.  The level of job security afforded to special needs assistants is just not satisfactory.  As the Minister knows, at the moment they cannot apply for new jobs because they may still have one.  They cannot get the relevant documentation to apply for work or to prepare to do so, because they just do not know what their situation will be.  There is no security and no certainty, and any steps the Minister can take to improve that situation, including an announcement this week, will be very welcome.  I stress that SNAs have a relationship with their assigned students.  We want that security and continuity to be there in order to strengthen their bond.<\/p> <p>We also want to establish a procedure for schools' grievances to be heard.  Last May, 558 schools were looking to appeal their special needs allocation under the new resource model.  Their principals closed their doors for the summer not knowing how they would prepare for the following year.  I do not think any of us would accept that as a satisfactory situation. <\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, not only because it will make progress with regards to removing the baptism barrier, but also because it will attempt to deal with children with special needs being denied access to local schools.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The National Council for Special Education has found that several schools are using restrictive admissions policies to deter students with special needs from seeking admission.  Some schools are telling parents they do not have the resources, and others are advising parents to go elsewhere for schools better suited to cater for their needs.  This is unacceptable.  I am sceptical about the motive behind these refusals.  The Minister's Bill would enable powers to ensure a school would open a special needs class for children where deemed necessary.  I very much welcome this. <\/p><p>There is a crisis regarding autism spectrum disorder places and units across the State.  There are parents frantically applying to every school in their county to try to secure a space for their child.  Some schools could be up to an hour and a half away from their home or from where the child's siblings go to school, but this is the reality for parents with children with special needs.  Could the Minister outline whether any proposals are in place to deal with this issue?<\/p><p>I would like to deal with the urgent need for NEPS psychologists in our schools.  I acknowledge the Minister referred to this in his speech.  In 2017, 619 schools across the State did not have access to a NEPS psychologist for the purpose of carrying out an assessment.  That is just shocking.  It flies in the face of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, which gives a statutory right to children to receive assessments in a timely manner.  The schools need greater resources from the State to provide these invaluable services.  If they do not get them, the State will essentially be forcing the parents and children into the private market to access services that they cannot go without.  Those parents who cannot afford to have a private assessment carried out risk having their child left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#MM00300","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his statement on speech and language therapy and occupational therapy provision.<\/p> <p>I am speaking on behalf of constituents in Dublin South-Central, my area, whose population of people with disabilities is above the national average.  The recent RT&Eacute; programme showed parents and children at St. John of God special school, Islandbridge, and how they are suffering.  Many of the children have had little or no access to occupational therapy or speech and language therapy.  These children cannot gain access to mainstream education because their needs are too severe.  One child, from Dolphin's Barn, Dublin 8, has received no therapies despite having severe needs.  We were downhearted when we heard this pretty horrific story.<\/p> <p>As we know, the therapies are vital to educational development.  One parent featured in the documentary explained she is worried her child will not be able to look after his own basic needs, such as washing and feeding himself.  It must be a discrimination issue.  Those who can afford it are substituting therapies that the school should provide with private interventions.  Why would they not when the therapy is not available in the schools?  The schools should be providing the therapy, not private operators.  It is unfair and a dangerous way to limp around the crisis.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane made a point on mainstream schools.  While the RT&Eacute; programme showed disabilities at the extreme end, I have been dealing with a young mother with a 14 year old boy who has not gone to school for two years.  He has been diagnosed with autism.  He has depression because he has been out of school for two years.  He was sent to the school in Blackrock but he has not attended for two years because he feels it is not fit for him in that he is not severely disabled.  Fitting into a mainstream school would really be possible but no school in his area will accept him unless acceptance comes with a package of support.  Obviously, his social skills and development will suffer, and his depression is increasing.  Unfortunately, he has been on Prozac for the past year.  We need to support such people in mainstream schools when a disability is not so severe as to warrant going to a special school.  There does not seem to be a plan for that.<\/p> <p>The Minister hopes officials from his Department will meet management of the special needs schools in Dublin.  Parents say they feel their children have been abandoned.  Did the meeting happen?  If so, could the Minister give an update on the next actions that are likely?<\/p> <p>The story highlights again the undeniable truth that parents should be involved at every level of decision-making about their children.  This is why I am nagging and not letting go in advocating parental voices on each and every board and decision-making table.  In the past day or two, I have been trying to ensure the HSE steering group making policy for children with complex needs does as Seanad &Eacute;ireann wishes and allows a parental voice on the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#NN00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate.  I will try to deal with each issue in turn.<\/p> <p>Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill, Gavan and others acknowledged the earlier allocation of special needs assistants.  This is welcome.  F&oacute;rsa was very keen to see this done.  It makes for better planning.  Whether we can bring the date back to March is probably an open question.  We allow applications to go beyond March.  We try to assess the applications that are received in a timely way and we then try to turn them around as quickly as possible.  I will consider whether we can do it even earlier but the purpose is to ensure we leave enough time for people to make their application and enough time for the school to absorb.<\/p> <p>I will have to get back to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill on some of the specific skills.  He did not mention the schools involved.  In general, when the Department publishes an indicative year for a school, for planning purposes, it does not constitute a promise that a school will be built in that year.  It may be listed for 2019 for the purpose of planning but each project depends on land acquisition and planning permission.  These matters can divert the progress on individual projects.  Many of the delays have been because of difficulties with land acquisition and planning applications.  Alternatively, adaptations had to be made because of roads and all sorts of other factors.  While the Department gives an indicative year, it should not be construed as a promise.  That is not the context.<\/p> <p>On school transport, the policy continues as it is.  There are those who are accommodated on a concessionary basis, but it is a concession.  The requirement on the minimum distance from the school, which must be met if one is to be entitled to school transport, remains.  That has been a bedrock of policy for a long time.  Representatives always come to me or the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  He is always asking whether the rule could not be bent a tiny bit to accommodate individuals but the truth is that if one changes the rule, it sets a precedent.  There are 4,000 schools and catchment areas.  The whole system is very difficult to manage if there is any small change.  That has been the difficulty.  We devote &euro;120 million to the programme so it is not that we are not spending the money.  We are.  Many children are being accommodated.<\/p> <p>Addressing capitation grants is part of our confidence and supply agreement, as it is part of the programme for Government.  In the first two budgets for which I have been Minister for Education and Skills, I have had to give priority to matters such as reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and tackling disadvantage.  I felt these were of greater priority in the shorter term if we were to meet real challenges.  I recognise fully that capitation is a problem for schools.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane raised a number of issues concerning our capacity and the way we cater for special needs.  The move away from regarding diagnosis as essential towards the front-loading of the school with the teaching resource is designed to try to be more flexible in addressing problems of every origin, including behavioural problems.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The teaching professionals can look at that child, his or her learning needs as they identify them and seek to cater to that child appropriately.  That is a more flexible way.  It allows the school to lead learning as best they can to cater to that child.<\/p><p>I fully acknowledge that in some cases diagnosis gives a huge insight that they perhaps would not have had and that it can be helpful, but the system that was there was that diagnosis was a gateway and if one did not get the diagnosis, the child would not get through the gate.  In terms of freeing up NEPS time to do the diagnosis where it adds value, as opposed to ticking a box on a form to trigger a provision, it is a win win.  It frees up the supports from NEPS to do assessment where it is needed, as in the example of Senator Ruane's own personal experience which she cited.  It can make a huge difference but we do not want to make it a requirement.<\/p><p>I hope that is the same with those specific requirements, for example, where there is difficulty with maths or numbers that the school can respond flexibly.  The NCSE has its own support service which we have now expanded and it is available to back up and build the capacity of a school to run the new resource teaching model.  Where there are particular problems, that resource can be called upon by the school to assist.  It is in a growth phase, it has only recently been established but we see a role for the NCSE in building capacity within the school.  That is the model we are moving towards, building capacity with professional assistance, not within the school but assigned to the school in different ways.  If there is an individual child whose needs cannot be met, and Senator Devine mentioned such a scenario, the NCSE will look at that and do its best to accommodate that child if he or she is brought to our attention.<\/p><p>Senator Ruane raises a valid point that the disability supports in further education are much weaker than in higher education.  As we move to develop further education as a pathway, and I am very keen to develop apprenticeships and traineeships as a more solid, respected and supported pathway, we need to devote more attention to disability supports.  That is something to take away from the debate.  I refer to the question of the curriculum in special schools only going to primary level and how young people would be equipped to live independently.  I am sure the special schools have appropriate curriculums and not just on the academic side but I will have to get back to Senator Ruane on that.<\/p><p>Senator Noone raised an issue on the progressive disability team.  This is a development within the health service rather than my own Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#NN00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#OO00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>It is related to the issue that Senator Devine raised regarding St. John of God special school.  As I understand it, the HSE is reconfiguring and moving to a model where it is seeking to have a range of supports within the community and that it would support the children with disabilities in the community, regardless of whether they are in a special school or not.  That is the model it is developing for general disability support but at the same time it is working with us in developing an in-school model where we not only deliver some service within the school, but build the capacity of the school to extend that service.  That can be a win win.<\/p> <p>In the short term it might be said that there is competition for a scarce number of therapists, but if therapists can be put into an environment where the value of their interventions is added through training teachers and SNAs to have better programmes in the gaps between these sessions, then we can have a win win.  We can have a greater impact on the children from the same number of therapists and if it proves itself of value in this pilot it will impact on the model as we move along.  It is deliberately a pilot but it is a pilot in which the HSE is fully embedded.  We can learn together on that.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan made a number of points on F&oacute;rsa and the development of SNAs.  I fully expect that the NCSE will recommend training development for SNAs.  In line with the professional development service for teachers and the various service providers, it is flexible.  It uses education centres and some outside providers so I have no doubt that any development being done by F&oacute;rsa can be assessed by the Department and the NCSE as a potential partner in developing appropriate training programmes.  The model, as can be seen from the pilot speech and language model, will be one where the speech and language therapist will not be just providing therapy to an individual child, but will be building the capacity of the teacher and the SNA through training, to extend and integrate that work.  This model is a clear signal along the road that Senator Gavan's members are advocating, who want to see further training and believe they can be part of a better delivery.  That is what we are trying to do.<\/p> <p>The issue of job security is pertinent.  It is inevitable with SNAs to a degree because they are often allocated to particular children and as that child moves on there is a question as to whether that post is available.  This is one of the issues the NCSE will be looking at in its assessment.  If this post is attached to a child it is not guaranteed to the school so there will always be some level of redeployment elsewhere.  The positive is that in the last number of years we have been adding about 1,000 SNAs per year.  We have been able to accommodate most of those who wanted to be redeployed to another place.  We have been able to accommodate them so the system has worked relatively well.  However, I take the point Senator Gavan is making.  It is an issue I do not have an immediate solution to because some of these are linked to an individual and his or her child.  I thank Senator Gavan for his support on the issue of how we give a clear signal on a legislative level to schools that soft barriers or any barriers to a child with special educational needs is not something we support.<\/p> <p>I refer to access to ASD places.  I agree that there are pockets where we have difficulties and the NCSE is addressing them.  The bigger picture is that we are accommodating an awful lot more children.  As I have said, the number of ASD units has grown rapidly.  They consist of six children per unit and the pupil equivalent has gone from 3,200 to 8,000 in the last seven years.  We have substantially expanded the number of places for intense support for children on the ASD spectrum and those are distributed right across the country.  There are some 1,325 in different schools.  However, there will inevitably be problems, for example, sometimes they will not be in the local school because they are specialist units, typically with six students assigned to them and it is only when a certain threshold is reached that the opening of a unit can be triggered.  I admit that there are problems in accommodating people's needs as quickly as we would like.  That is why home tuition can sometimes be an inevitable bridge.  The bigger picture is that we are continuing to expand and the legislative power is being taken to require these units to be opened.<\/p> <p>Not only are we expanding NEPS but as I said to Senator Ruane, the move away from requiring assessments as a gateway to get a service, to using assessment as an added value to ensure teachers are best informed of what a child needs, is in itself freeing up NEPS resources to be deployed more effectively.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are making progress on the number of schools covered and the way in which we cover them.  We are continuing to expand NEPS.  We are currently giving priority to disadvantaged schools, which I am sure the Senator would accept is a sensible approach but we will seek to expand that.<\/p><p>Senator Devine raised the issue of St. John of God special school.  I hope our new model will help the situation there.  It is one of the schools within the area where the new pilot will apply.  We will have 19 speech and language therapists supporting a range of schools, including special schools, and this one will be among them.  The position generally, as I understand it, is that while on the education side there are 92 children there, we have 16 teachers, a principal and 30 special needs assistants.  That is our provision.  Until this pilot we had not been providing speech and language therapy but under this pilot we will be providing speech and language and occupational therapies.  I understand the provision of these therapies has been made to the overall range of services provided by the St. John of God organisation in the catchment.  While some resources are assigned to the school more are assigned to the St. John of God's overall range of services, which have to cope with some of the difficulties referred to in terms of unfilled posts.  That is a short-term problem but I certainly hope that school's inclusion in our pilot will be of help.  My Department has had meetings with those in the school and this is one positive response that I hope will help that school.<\/p><p>Senator Devine raised the issue of children with very particular needs.  There is no doubt they present challenges to the school system.  We have been in the business of teaching and providing special needs assistants for children with those needs.  We recognise that if we are to cater for some children, we need to find a way of building a new partnership with other providers such as speech and language and occupational therapists.  If this model is successful, we can consider other potential specialisms where we could have professional partnerships between teachers, special needs assistants and parents in the school and those professionals.  I hope this approach will open up a new route to catering more fully to a wider range of needs within the school setting.  That could allow more children to successfully progress through the school.  <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has looked internationally to see if there is a bolt-on model that would represent best practice for dealing with children with special needs, but there is not one.  No one is putting their hands up and saying our model is a world leader.  Many are looking at what we are doing and saying we are in a pretty good space in terms of the way in which we approach the challenge.  How one gets the best model for integrating children with special needs into a school system on an integrated basis presents a challenge in every education system.  I look forward to the work of the NCSE.  It has just been received in my Department and is being assessed.   Obviously, we will have to go to Government to bring it to the next level.  The NCSE has put a great deal of work into this to help us design a model that would have the confidence of parents, which Senator Noone rightly pointed out is very important, and to provide us with the evidence to suggest this route is the right one to take.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  While this area does not get national attention, it is a challenging one that deserves attention from the Oireachtas.  It is an area where we do many positive things and prevent many problems that might otherwise develop and, thereby, allow people fulfil their potential, which is the goal that motivates all of us in the education area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#OO00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>That concludes statements on special education provision.<\/p><p>I welcome to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery this afternoon James Connolly, a retired brigadier general born on 1 November 1923.

He is here on behalf of the group known as the hooded men, 14 in all, who were selected by the British and unionist governments for special attention.  They were separated out and isolated from several hundred men who, like them, were arrested in swoops in the days and weeks after internment was introduced in the North in August 1971.  That special attention led to these 14 men experiencing a horrendous period at a secret location, which we now know to be Ballykelly army barracks, where they were tortured by highly-trained members of the British Crown forces whose identity, despite the passage of 50 years, remains unknown to these 14 men.  Their identity remains protected by the British Government on whose behalf they practised their nefarious deeds on these defenceless, captive men.<\/p><p>For almost 50 years, the hooded men have been on a mission for truth and justice for themselves, their families and for humanity itself.  Four of the 14 men have died during this time and our solidarity and support is with their families today.  The remainder continue on their quest for justice.  It is a quest that began in August 1971, in a dark, despairing and dangerous dungeon where these men, individually and separately, were hooded, handcuffed to a radiator and systematically and ruthlessly interrogated beyond the point of exhaustion over a seven to ten day period.  These vulnerable men were cruelly and grievously injured, physically and psychologically, by their captors.  The full resources of the British state were used to try to crush the will of these 14 men.  They were guinea pigs in a torture experiment which the British Government had used in other colonies and on other defenceless and captured prisoners.  <\/p><p>The methods deployed on Irish citizens, the ABCs of torture, are still followed to this day throughout the world.  The toolkit of the torturer was multi-layered.  The first and most essential part of the torturers' tool kit was the knowledge that what he was doing had the approval of the British and unionist governments and that he had immunity from prosecution or accountability for his cruel behaviour.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The second part was the knowledge that the torturer was trained in his dark arts by the British Ministry of Defence and was well paid for his service.  The toolkit also included the torturer's menu - the infamous five techniques.  These techniques, when combined, subjected the men to so-called \"deep interrogation\".  These techniques were meticulously refined to have maximum impact on the helpless individual being experimented on.  For the techniques to work effectively, however, the men had to be in a state of fear and uncertainty.  <\/p><p>They were violently arrested from their homes by the British Crown forces.  They were hooded and taken by helicopter to an unknown destination where silence and isolation reigned.  They were stripped of their clothes and personal belongings and forced to wear a boiler suit and hood.  As Mr. Francie McGuigan told us at the recent briefing here in Leinster House, at times they were stripped and photographed, with their torturers holding up their brutalised bodies by the hair - another form of so-called degrading treatment.  That was just like in Guantanamo, in Abu Ghraib and in Palestine.  The torturer's handbook is followed meticulously to this very day.<\/p><p>One of the most noted stories of torture endured by these men was when they were hooded.  They were brought from the specially-designed torture chamber at Ballykelly to a helicopter and flown for a prolonged period but just four or five feet in the air.  While hooded, they were thrown backwards out of the helicopter, thinking they were God knows how high up.  The psychology behind all of this was to deprive the men of their normal everyday sensory experience of life.  The boiler suit and the hood over their heads covered their naked bodies.  They lived in their boiler suits for over a week and performed all bodily functions.  The hood was only removed during interrogations.  The five techniques included prolonged periods of standing against the wall with arms and legs spreadeagled - the so-called stress position.  They were hooded day and night and were deprived of sleep by what the men described as a high pitched hissing noise.  They was also deprived of food and drink.  <\/p><p>During the recent briefing in Leinster House, we were told it was like the noise went in through one's head and then penetrated every sinew and muscle of the body.  It went down into the lungs and came out through the toes. The men were repeatedly and viciously beaten about the head and had their genitals kicked.  They were continuously threatened with death.  The effect of this was prolonged pain, physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.  Having listened to the men's story, I contest that not only were they subjected to torture over this period but so too were their families.  These men were taken from their homes and their people.  Their mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters and wives and girlfriends knew nothing of their whereabouts during the whole duration of their torture.  Families were crippled with fear because they did not know where their loved ones had been taken.  They went to hospitals.  They even went to mortuaries.  Their fathers pleaded with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC.  It said it did not have them.  However, we know it had them.  It had them in Ballykelly barracks.  <\/p><p>All of this was done at a time when sectarian killings were rife and when young men were being lifted off the streets to meet the cruelest of ends.  Imagine the worry for their families and the torture for their families when the very people who arrested them without trial were then telling their loved ones that they were gone and that they did not have them.  What happened to them, ultimately, at the end of this prolonged period of torture?  There was no wrap-around care, no after services and no counselling.  They went into Long Kesh internment camp.  They were arrested and held without trial or charge.  The entirety and magnitude of all of these frightening ordeals continue to haunt these men to this very day.  Most reasonable people know that what these men experienced was torture.  <\/p><p>However, the reason Mr. Liam Shannon is with us today is because the European Court of Human Rights decided that the men were not in fact tortured.  They are here because the court has a different threshold when defining torture than that which I have just described.  Believe it or not, what I have just described is not torture according to the court.  The court does, however, readily accept that what the men experienced was \"inhumane and degrading treatment\".  We all agree on that.  I, like many colleagues and most sensible people, am baffled as to the legal difference between torture and inhumane and degrading treatment.  What is the difference?  I do not believe there is any difference.  Human rights organisations around the world do not believe there is a difference.  The Irish State does not believe there is a difference and that is why it has taken Britain to the European courts twice since 1971.<\/p><p>In 1971, the Irish Government - on the men's behalf - took the British state to the European Human Rights Commission.  The Commission unanimously found the British Government guilty of torturing the men.  The British Government appealed that decision and in 1978, the European Court of Human Rights reversed the Commission's verdict and found the British Government guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment and not torture.  Here we are today.  Under international pressure, however, the British Government announced that it would never again use the five techniques on defenceless prisoners.  In December 2014, following renewed efforts by the men and their families, the Irish Government again took the British Government to the European Court of Human Rights to seek to overturn the 1978 verdict on the basis of new facts.  It sought to reinstate the European Human Rights Commission verdict of torture.  <\/p><p>In March this year, the European Court of Human Rights upheld its 1978 decision that the British Government used inhuman and degrading treatment and not torture.  I ask Members to support this motion calling on the Irish Government to appeal the decision earlier this year and to continue the good work the State began in 1971.  Time is quickly running out to lodge this appeal.  It is a straightforward matter and the Government should act swiftly.  The men - and indeed society here in Ireland and across the world - need and look to the Irish Government to pursue justice for them until it is ultimately achieved.  Such persistence sends a very clear message to those governments that continue to use inhuman and degrading torture that their actions are being scrutinised and that they will be made accountable for them.  <\/p><p>Francie McGuigan put it very succinctly when at the briefing two weeks ago he said that what they were seeking was simple.  They want the British Government to wear the label of torturer on the international stage because that is what exactly what it was.  There should be no legal or popular tolerance of torture, no matter what the circumstances.  Human rights courts need to be crystal clear on this fundamental issue.  When the hooded men came to Leinster House, they moved us with their stories.  They insisted that this is not a political issue.  They further stressed that it certainly is not a party political issue.  They told us this is an issue of human rights.  Their lawyer, Darragh Mackin, said that the Irish State had taken this case because it knew the truth of what these men endured.  Why would one set out on this legal journey and not see it through to the very end?  <\/p><p>I agree with all of those sentiments and I have no doubt but that the other Members do too.  Regardless of its significance, the term \"legacy case\" has almost lost its edge and its importance because there is such a litany of so many experiences from the course of the conflict.  This is not just a legacy case, however.  This has live immediate lived consequences for these men and their families.  It has live legal implications for victims of torture all around the world while states continue to use the verdict in respect of to this case as some kind of cloak of convenience or cover for the torture that they inflict on citizens, whether their own or from other countries.  <\/p><p>The book written by Father Denis Faul and Monsignor Raymond Murray in 1975 on the experiences of the hooded men continues to sell all around the world to this day.  It is a sad reflection of the interest in this case and the example being looked to by victims of torture all around the world in the form of the hooded men and their campaign.  I urge the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, to tell us that this appeal will be lodged and that the Irish State will not just stand for the hooded men but will stand for victims of torture all around the world.  More importantly, I refer to the Irish State standing for any further potential victims of torture in order that we can shine a light and expose what happened to the hooded men and that this State will set an example across the EU and beyond that we stand for justice and truth.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#SS00300","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I second the motion put forward by my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  Many issues could be discussed today as serious issues are happening in our country.  We decided, however, as a Sinn F&eacute;in team in this House that justice for the hooded men was more important than anything else.  That was because this is a very time-limited decision.  A decision needs to be made today and it needs to be followed up with a clear process.<\/p> <p>We are discussing torture here today.  I refer to torture inflicted on Irish citizens by the British Government.  I pay tribute to those who suffered this torture and who are here with us today, as well as those who cannot be here.

I commend the RT&Eacute; investigations unit and the Pat Finucane Centre on spending many months trawling through documents at the British National Archives in Kew.  They discovered that, as early as March 1971, RUC officers were being trained in the application of the five techniques and that a facility to house the process was also in planning.  It appears that the five techniques had ministerial approval and that the individual cases were settled out of court to ensure that no Minister, former or present, could be charged with the conspiracy.  The Conservative Party Government of the day authorised torture and subsequent Labour Party Governments covered it up.<\/p><p>The 1978 judgment which turned torture into degrading and inhuman treatment had implications far beyond this island.  In 2003, the US Attorney General quoted the 1978 ruling as justification for the use of torture and interrogation methods in Iraq, claiming that what was being done was not torture.  Ireland, as a nation of people, has a reputation abroad for standing up against inhumane treatment.  We would like to see our Government take stronger action against those who carry out torture and extra-judicial murder, but at least we call it what it is.  Let us not be found wanting in our own country.<\/p><p>I am urging Senators to support this motion in order that the moral compass can be recalibrated.  Treating individuals in the way described by my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, is torture.  The torture he described, which took place in Ballykelly and elsewhere, had a devastating impact on the lives of those who suffered through it and, indeed, who still suffer today as a result of it.  Its impact was felt by the communities from which they came.  They suffered with the victims.  When one of their own was brutalised and tortured, the integrity of the community was dealt a blow.  When injustice touches upon areas of human dignity there will always be a reaction.  We must ensure that this never happens again.  The first step towards achieving this is to define it accurately as torture.  All forms of torture must be ended, in Ireland, in Palestine and beyond.<\/p><p>I understand there is cross-party support for this motion.  The appeals process must be instigated immediately.  I thank all of those who have taken an interest.  I also thank my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  It shows the merit of having somebody with a 32-county perspective in this House.  We all have such a perspective but Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile lives within that affected community and is able to bring the story to Leinster House.  Until the presentation was done in the AV room a number of weeks ago and until we heard first-hand details from the men who had suffered and their solicitor, we were not conscious of it.  The story has been brought back to us now.  I remember being told about the hooded men as a child.  It always seemed like something abstract, as if it could not have really happened.  I particularly remember the story of people being dropped out of helicopters.  There is a certain amount of disbelief involved regardless of who tells the tale.  We might believe perhaps that there is a bias in the telling, but when one hears it straight from the mouths of the men involved and when they recount exactly what was done to them, there is no question that it has to be named and shamed and called torture.  If what they outlined is not torture, I do not know what is.<\/p><p>I hope that this appeal will go forward.  I trust that the Government will do the right thing.  The natural next step is to appeal the ruling.  It can be appealed before 18 June.  That should happen.  I think and hope that the result will be different this time around and that the men and their families will get the peace and justice for which they have waited decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#TT00200","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>One has to recognise that these men were detained in the absence of any due process, judicial process or a proper charging system.  It is very important to recognise that.  Torture is not acceptable in any way, but it is important to say that what happened in this case is aggravated by the fact that no proper processes were observed.  There were no procedures adhered to and the men were not afforded the opportunity to defend themselves.  That makes what happened all the more reprehensible.<\/p> <p>The men involved were detained in 1971.  There are 14 people involved in this and I welcome those present in the Public Gallery.  It is worth repeating what these men were subjected to and what they went through.  The first form of torture was wall standing.  They were spread-eagled against a wall in a strained position for periods totalling between 23 and 29 hours.  That speaks for itself.  Dark bags were placed over the heads of these men, pending interrogation, and they were held in a room where there was a continuous loud hissing noise.  In advance of interrogation, they were deprived of sleep for unknown periods.  They were also deprived of food and drink.  Furthermore, there were the episodes involving helicopters and the horrendous fear that was instilled in the men as a result.<\/p> <p>In 1978, the ECHR found that the use of these techniques on the men by the British authorities amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment but did not constitute torture.  The court entered the realm of semantics at that stage.  It effectively was torture.  I do not know how the distinctions were drawn given the evidence available.  The full judgment in that case was that the ECHR did not accept the designation of torture.  In contrast, the European Commission on Human Rights, a body which once existed to take evidence, issue reports and decide whether cases could go to the ECHR, had classified the treatment of these men as torture and inhumane.  That is a point worth noting.<\/p> <p>In December 2014, Ireland requested that the ECHR judgment from 1978 be revised, as is provided for under Rule 80 of the court.  Subsection 1 of the rule states, \"A party may, in the event of the discovery of a fact which might, by its nature, have a decisive influence and which, when a judgment was delivered, was unknown to the Court and could not reasonably have been known to that party, request the Court, within a period of six months after that party acquired knowledge of the fact, to revise that judgment.\"  The new knowledge arose from the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  We should salute RT&Eacute; and those involved in the programme, and in the documentary relating to this case, for that.  New facts, documentation and information emerged which suggested ministerial involvement.  On that basis, the Government sought a revision.  We are all addressing this issue in a unified and sincere fashion, so I believe Senator Conway-Walsh probably should have placed more emphasis on the bone fides of the Government, particularly in view of the fact that it made the application and then fought the case.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There has not been an issue with that, nor should there have been.

In its 2014 application, the Government stated that, as a result of the documentary, it had obtained a large amount of documents which demonstrated that the then UK Government had withheld information from the original proceedings and questioned the alleged psychiatric expert known as Doctor L.  That man testified that the after-effects had not been long-term in nature, which was very wrong.<\/p><p>The request is that the matter go before the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights.  At this point, I have no philosophical objection to that.  I doubt that any Member of the Oireachtas would have such an objection or would look at this matter with anything but horror.  What happened was wrong and the fact that people were detained and tortured in the fashion described is not acceptable.  The Attorney General had to weigh up the facts.  I have to put it on the record that up to now such an application has never been granted.

Fianna F&aacute;il supports the motion on the case of the hooded men which relates to events that took place during a dark period of the Troubles.  The legal ramifications echo to this very day.  The case should be appealed to the courts.<\/p> <p>It is disappointing that the Government had to be taken to the High Court by legal representatives of the hooded men in order to be encouraged to take the most recent case, which came to a conclusion with which we are not satisfied.  Hence our demand that it to be taken to the higher court.  What happened to the hooded men has been outlined, including the interrogation techniques used, such as stress positions, white noise, sleep deprivation, food and water deprivation, having hoods placed over them for days at a time and being subjected to physical and mental torture.<\/p> <p>One European body found that they were tortured but this was overturned, on appeal, by the relevant court.  We know from the most recent revelations in the courts that much of the information which should have been supplied by the British side was withheld.  That is why we need to ensure that the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, which will comprise 17 judges rather than the seven involved in hearing the case previously, will overturn the judgment handed down and find that what happened constituted torture.<\/p> <p>It is important that what the men were subjected to is found to be torture by a European court.  The case is being used by regimes, democratic and otherwise, all over the world as an excuse to subject prisoners to the same methods to this very day.  Enhanced interrogation techniques were used in Abu Ghraib and other places about which we will never hear.  If we do not pursue this to the end, we will be doing a disservice to humanity for generations to come.  This ruling is being used time and again by no less an authority than the White House and others to justify the use of torture.  No word other than torture can be used to describe to what these men were subjected.  To say that enhanced interrogation techniques were used is an appalling use of any language because no human being could go through the treatment these men were subjected to and come out the same person on the other side.  To not be affected would be beyond human capacity.<\/p> <p>The techniques used were designed so that people would be affected and afraid, not just those who were subjected to them but also their families.  Others would get the message that this could befall them if they did not lie down and remain silent.  In this instance, the British Government was the regime which was subjecting what it believed to be its citizens to such treatment.  If it happened in Finchley, which, as Mrs. Thatcher believed, was as British as Northern Ireland, I imagine people would have gone to jail.  However, nobody has gone to jail.  The Crown Prosecution Service is making no attempt to have any of those involved put in jail because they are immune from prosecution due to the fact that this was a political decision taken at the highest level.  The European courts are giving it political cover by saying that while distressing as the techniques were, they did not constitute torture.  I do not believe anyone in this room or anywhere in the world could support such an assertion by any court.  That is why we support the motion.<\/p> <p>Is the Government going to have to be taken to the High Court?  Having spoken to the solicitors for the men, I understand they will have to take the Government to the High Court again.  It is not a legal issue as much as it is a political one.  Does the Government have the will to take the British Government to court?  It is down to the 17 judges to decide whether what happened was torture but it is up to the Government to take the case to the next level.  It is not doing it on behalf of the 14 hooded men or their families.  Rather, it is doing it on behalf of all of the people who could be arrested and subjected to the same techniques because of the ruling of a court nearly four decades ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#VV00400","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I compliment Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile on bringing the motion forward.

I want to share time with my good colleague here.  However, this happened in 1971.  The Irish Government brought a case to the European Commission on Human Rights in 1976 and the British Government was found guilty of torture.  On appeal, that wording was amended so that the word \"torture\" was not used.  As was said earlier, I do not understand the difference.  If I may say so it seems to be some form of a cop-out.  Let us call a spade a spade.  In 2013 declassified documents were uncovered which revealed the existence of the interrogation centre at Ballykelly.  As I understand it, this information was withheld from trial in 1976.  As somebody who practiced law as a solicitor for a number of years, this seems to me to be a miscarriage of justice and grounds for a mistrial.  Evidence which was clearly important was not made available and, as other people have said, but for the RT&Eacute; documentary \"RT&Eacute; Investigations Unit: The Torture Files\", which brought this to light and but for the great investigative journalism that was carried out, this may never have been uncovered.  The Minister of State and I are together on this and for the ten people who are alive and their families - but probably even more so for Mr. Shannon's colleagues who are not here and their families - let us do what we are good at in Ireland and give this 110% and our best shot.

I read some reports yesterday in research for this debate and I noted a comment of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, who stated that the appeal is not straightforward.

Separately, I have been informed that the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland is currently hearing civil proceedings in which it is claimed that a PSNI decision to end preliminary inquiries into the deep interrogation methods deployed against the 14 men was seriously flawed and should be squashed.  Does the Minister of State or the Government know anything about the progress of those proceedings?<\/p> <p>This is about the Government.  It is about Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling on the Government here today.  We hear so much about what the Attorney General and the legal advisers say.

They were subjected to sleep deprivation, wall standing, stress positions, white noise and beatings.  Alex Kane wrote in <i>The Irish News<\/i>a few days ago &quot;that the past is always in front of us&quot;.  Our history and our past are always in front of us.  If we want to deal with the legacy issues and with truth and reconciliation, we must have an understanding of what happened.  We must find the truth and justice must be done, whether for the State or for anybody else.<\/p><p>In 1971, Ireland made a complaint to the European Commission on Human Rights that these 14 men, who had been interned in Northern Ireland that year, had been subject to five techniques of enhanced interrogation that constituted torture under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  While the Commission upheld that view, a subsequent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in 1978 found that the techniques were not torture but &quot;inhumane and degrading treatment&quot;.  In 2014, the Government lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights requesting that it revise its 1978 judgment to say that the treatment constituted torture under Article 3 and not inhumane and degrading treatment.  The application was based on material released into the National Archives of the UK by the UK Government. <\/p><p>I welcome this motion by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  I welcome the fact that Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is in this Chamber because he brings that perspective to an area about which we have sometimes forgotten about and about which we want to forget.  Unless we have truth and reconciliation, these things must be aired on the floor of this Chamber.  I thank Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile for bringing the motion.  Many issues have arisen in the past 30 years which we can debate and about which we can call for resolution in this Chamber.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are united across party lines to get truth and reconciliation.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh summed it up correctly that Ireland is moving in a different direction.  We are seen as independent, with no colonial baggage.  We are seen now as independent arbiters around the world.  If we want to have a global footprint, we cannot have issues on our doorstep or on our island that we have not addressed.  We are talking about the legacies of the past.  These things must be deal with, so I support that call. <br\/><br\/>Some of the material disclosed by the RT&Eacute; investigations unit included a letter dated in 1977 from the Home Secretary, Merlyn Rees MP, to the then Prime Minister, James Callaghan.  In that letter, Rees stated his view that the decision to use methods of torture in Northern Ireland in 1971 and 1972 was taken by Ministers, in particular Peter Carington MP, the then Secretary of State for Defence.  On 20 March 2018, the court delivered its judgment in the matter of the Government's application for revision.  The decision of the court was supported by a majority of six judges to one, but interestingly the minority view was expressed in a strongly worded dissent by the Irish judge, S&iacute;ofra O'Leary.  Judge O'Leary said that the seven-member Chamber had &ldquo;opted for an extremely narrow version of what the Court was dealing with in 1976-1978&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The hooded men's judgment was a landmark in international law, as it was the first time a state took on another state at the European Court of Human Rights.  However, we can all acknowledge the deep disappointment being felt by the men and their families right now.  It must also be said here that four of the original hooded men have since died: Sean McKenna, Michael Montgomery, Pat Shivers and Gerry McKerr.  I was honoured to meet Mr. Liam Shannon, who is in the Visitors Gallery.  I hope that we shine a light on injustices, try to get the truth and move this forward.<br\/><br\/>Noting the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in March, the Taoiseach said that these men were certainly subjected to terrible abuse and degrading punishment.  He also said at the time of the judgment that the Government would consider it, and having done so make a decision on whether to appeal it.  I understand the Government has not yet made a decision on whether to apply for a referral to the Grand Chamber.  I also understand that advice from counsel will need to be carefully considered by the Attorney General <i>inter alia <\/i>before any Cabinet decision to move ahead with the application.  I urge the Government to support this cause but, in that context, the Government has decided neither to oppose nor to support this motion.<br\/><br\/>The motion's proposers are right.  I attended events to commemorate the Good Friday Agreement in Washington last week.  We went to Capitol Hill to thank the politicians, the members of Congress and the people of the United States for their support in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to the island of Ireland.  We thanked them, but we also said that we must renew this.  The Good Friday Agreement cannot move forward unless we deal with situations and issues like this.  I hope that in the coming weeks the Government will support this decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#WW00800","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I offer my full support to the motion before us today, and I commend Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile and his colleagues on bringing it forward.  I also welcome Mr. Liam Shannon to the Visitors Gallery today.  More than anything, I want to let the people involved know that I am fully behind them.  The hooded men and their families have my full support in their search for justice, no matter how long that may take.  I commend them on their bravery in pushing forward with this.<\/p><p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  A big part our work is to look at the legacy of the conflict in the North and the lasting impact it still has on our communities.  It has been devastating to hear many of the stories from victims and survivors, and to see the level of unresolved trauma that we are still dealing with now.  Speaking to people, one can feel the weight and the burden that is being carried, and how that can result in enduring intergenerational trauma unless it is properly addressed.<\/p><p>I also see this in my work with the RISE Foundation almost every week.  In the area of addiction, unaddressed trauma can have such a huge impact on families and children, passed on through generations.  In all cases, we have a responsibility to help those involved address what has happened, and this is no different.  After the court ruled in March, Francie McGuigan bravely spoke to the <i>thejournal.ie <\/i>and said: &ldquo;There were 14 of us &ndash; four of the lads are dead but their families still there, so it&rsquo;s not just about us.&quot;  That is such a powerful point, and something we should all remember.  There is such a large network of people around these 14 men, including families, friends, and their wider community, that is still waiting for justice and dealing with this.  We have a responsibility to all of them to provide our support.<\/p><p>I was re-reading some of the old case files this morning.  What these men were put through really is unimaginable.  On top of brutal beatings and death threats, the men were subjected to the now infamous &quot;five techniques&quot;, including hooding, wall-standing in stress positions for hours, subjection to white noise, sleep deprivation, and deprivation of food and water.  None of the 14 men involved was ever convicted of any criminal offence.  They were simply interned, tortured and abandoned.<\/p><p>I want to put it on the record of this House again that what happened to those men over seven days in Ballykelly in 1971 was torture.  It was torture by the definition of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1976, and it was torture by any reasonable person's reading of the brutal, inhumane techniques that were used.  When we hear that a man was hooded and thrown from a helicopter to make him feel that he was about to die, we do not need to equivocate.  That is torture.<\/p><p>The European Court of Human Rights made a mistake in 1978, and it missed a huge opportunity to atone for it in March.  Amnesty International expressed its disappointment at the ruling, saying that it focused on a narrow legal technicality instead of engaging with the substance of the torture claims.  This is an important point.  Ultimately, the court debated whether the information released in 2014 would have led to a different ruling in 1978, not whether the techniques themselves would be judged as torture in today's society.  In fact, the court specifically referenced case law highlighting how our understanding of what constitutes torture has expanded and become more humane as the decades have passed.  This is really important, and it speaks volumes about the decision taken in 1978.  That initial ruling was an injustice not only to the 14 men and their families, but also in its broader impact on the world in the years since.  Amnesty International has documented how since that decision was handed down, many countries, including the United States and Israel, have relied on it to justify an aggressive, horrific legal interpretation of what does or does not constitute torture.<\/p><p>When the world recoils in horror at what was done to human beings in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, we should remember that the US Government specifically referenced this verdict in its legal defence of its actions.  What was carried out, it claimed, was not torture but &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;.  This is an insult both to language and to human dignity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#XX00200","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#XX00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>It came to be one of the most appalling, defining features of the war on terror, and reminds us of the global impact of decisions like this.<\/p> <p>Amnesty International won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its work against torture, and I commend Grainne Teggart and its Northern Ireland office on its continued tireless work on this case.

That is what I find utterly shocking.  The men were innocent when they were suddenly lifted off the street.  This is a human rights matter.<br\/><br\/>We hear a lot about western values and the United States and Britain charging into other countries all over the world in defence of western values, but they engaged in extraordinary rendition, torture and drone attacks where the most fundamental aspects of human rights, going back over many centuries, are routinely violated.  What happened to the right to be presumed innocent?  What happened to the right to face one's accuser?  What happened to the right to be legally represented?  Oh no.  All of those can go.  When Britain and the United States engage in these tactics, they are not speaking for me, and they are not speaking for western values.  They are the very opposite of western values.<br\/><br\/>The European Commission on Human Rights found that this was torture.  That should have been the end of it.  There must have been intense diplomatic lobbying to get that changed to the mealy-mouthed verbiage of inhumane and degrading treatment.  That is complete and utter nonsense.  It says that if the case was tried now, it would be found to be torture.  If it is torture now, it was torture 20 years ago.  If an act is torture, it is torture <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  It just has to be torture.  It is also an extremely dangerous precedent.  If this defective ruling is not challenged, it gives legitimacy to regimes all over the world which continue to engage in these disgusting practices.  How can it not be torture to have somebody standing for 29 hours, as somebody said previously, in a stressed position?  The muscles would be in agony after that.  As for dropping people out of a helicopter, maybe it was from 5 ft off the ground, but the people who were being dropped did not know that.  I am surprised that none of them died of heart attacks.  I certainly would have been a prime candidate for a heart attack if it had happened to me.<br\/><br\/>On the question of the appeal to the Grand Chamber, of course they must do it.  There should be no mealy-mouthed farting around about this sort of business.  My decent friend, Senator O'Reilly, said that no appeal has ever been successful.  I do not know whether that is true but it does not matter a damn whether it is because if we say we will not take an appeal because an appeal has never been successful, why not abolish the entire appeals process?  There is no point in it if nobody will use it because so far nobody has been successful.  That is outrageous.  We must take that on.

It struck me that the European Convention on Human Rights was delivered by the Council of Europe.  It also struck me on my first visit to the Council of Europe that we have a very good team of people there working on a human rights agenda on behalf of this country.  In what was almost the first conversation, and Senator O'Reilly will confirm this, people were highlighting in particular our judge, S&iacute;ofra O'Leary, and the fantastic work she is doing.  It is no coincidence that she was the judge who held the minority opinion in this case.<\/p> <p>I want to elaborate on what Senator Feighan said in his very fine contribution about the way Judge O'Leary emphasised the gravity of the issue before the courts.  She noted that an interstate application is \"not the exercise of a right of action to enforce the applicant state's rights but [and she stresses this] an action against an alleged violation of the public order of Europe\".<\/p> <p>The value of legal certainty therefore should be balanced against this public interest.  The public interest in this case is particularly salient in light of the fact that the original judgment was utilised by, amongst others, the United States to legitimise and defend what it termed enhanced interrogation techniques during the so-called war on terror.<\/p> <p>Criticising the judgment, and this is significant, she stated the majority focuses almost exclusively on the \"two illustrative cases\" to the exclusion of all other detainees who were subjected to the five techniques.  The reason \"two illustrative cases\" were \"heard\" by the commission was for reasons of \"procedural economy\", that is, it would be too burdensome for the commission to hear from all the detainees.  However, the commission and the court had received written evidence pertaining to 14 of these cases.  Instead, the majority judgment focuses only on the \"two illustrative cases\".<\/p> <p>There we have it.  The judgment is fundamentally flawed, and an Irish judge on that court called that out clearly.  When it is that clear, we have to insist that the Government pursue this appeal.  If it is somewhat problematic, that is fine.  Let it be somewhat problematic but they must pursue the appeal because to do anything less does not just let down these men and their families or ourselves as a nation; it lets down the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#YY01100","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#YY01200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I was reading earlier about a man I had never heard of previously named Baha Mousa.

Operation Demetrius was a British military operation which flagrantly disregarded the human rights of communities in the North.  Not only were these men tortured, but 342 people were interned without trial.  This number grew to 1,981 by December 1975.  In 1978, this State was the first to bring a complaint against another through the European Court of Human Rights.  The case was Ireland <i>v<\/i>. the United Kingdom.  At that time, the State prioritised standing up for human rights over cautious diplomatic relations.  This should be considered in light of the recent events in Gaza and the tenure of Israeli diplomats within this State.<\/p><p>The State has an opportunity within its grasp to seek absolute justice for these men.  The grave injustice done to them was not carried out by rogue military officers, it was co-ordinated carefully by those in the upper echelons of British politics.  These wrongs must come to light and the island must be one which stands against violations of core human rights.  I commend Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile on his work in respect of this issue and on the way in which he has championed human and civil rights on every part of the island.  It says something about him that, notwithstanding the fact that he is one of the younger Members of the Oireachtas, he and his office have taken on an prioritised something that happened 50 years.  This goes to show that young people demand rights and peace, not only from the gun but for people living as survivors.  I commend the Government for not opposing the motion and assert that the case must be fought with absolute vigour by the Department.  For over 45 years, Mr. Shannon has fought alongside others for justice and we must honour that fight by our efforts in all further litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has been a cornerstone of Ireland's approach to human rights for decades.  Ireland is rightly seen across the world as a defender of the international human rights framework, including through its work in the EU and at international fora such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  The case taken by Ireland against the UK in 1971 broke new ground in the international protection of human rights.  As the first inter-state case to be brought before the European Court of Human Rights, Ireland <i>v<\/i>. the United Kingdom showed that all states which signed up to international agreements on human rights could and should be held accountable.  That is a principle by which we stand today.<\/p><p>On 2 December 2014, the Government announced its decision to request the European Court of Human Rights to revise its 1978 judgment in the case taken by Ireland against the UK.  On the basis of new material uncovered, the Government contended that the ill-treatment suffered by 14 men in Northern Ireland in 1971 should be recognised as torture.  The court's judgment was delivered on 20 March.  It refused the Government's application to revise the 1978 judgment and find that the men had suffered torture.  The refusal was made on two grounds.  First, the court did not believe the new documents contained a sufficient <i>prima facie<\/i>case that one of the witnesses had misled the Commission and the court about the long-term effects of the five techniques of interrogation.  Second, the court did not accept that even if Dr. Leigh had given misleading evidence, it might have had a decisive influence on the court's finding in the original judgment.<\/p><p>The men who suffered this treatment have understandably been disappointed by the court's decision.  Four decades have gone by since the case was first decided by the court and the men have shown great courage and dignity in continuing to seek to have their treatment recognised as torture.  My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, met the men recently to hear of their experiences.  From speaking to him, I know that he was deeply moved by what they told him.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the fortitude and persistence of the men who became known around the world as the hooded men.  They have had to deal with the long-lasting effects of this treatment and my thoughts are with them this evening.  It is important to remember that nothing in the judgment of 20 March changes the finding that the men suffered inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of their rights under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Nor does it mean that this treatment is not, by current standards, torture.  The revision procedure is about looking again at the case as it was at the time and considering whether the new information would have changed the court's decision at the time of the original judgment.  In this case, the court decided that it would have changed the original judgment.<\/p><p>Many people are eager that the Government should seek a referral of the revision application to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights.  While this is possible, it is important to note that there is no automatic right of referral.  Any application to have the case referred to the Grand Chamber must first be considered by a panel of five judges.  No application to refer a revision request to the Grand Chamber has ever been successful.  The Government has not ruled out making such an application but it is a decision we will not take lightly.  The Government has three months from the date of the decision to apply for a referral.  We are using that time to consider the judgment carefully before any Cabinet decision on whether to move ahead with the application.  When the Government has made a decision on whether to apply for a referral to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, that decision will be made public.<\/p><p>I assure the men whose treatment led Ireland to take this case in 1971 and all those who have campaigned with them in the decades since that the Government regards this case with the utmost seriousness.  That is why we will consider the judgment of 20 March very carefully before reaching a decision based on the information and advice that we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1241"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending and for his contribution to what, in light of the comments of Members across the Chamber, has been a significant and important debate.  I thank all Members for their contributions.  I note the broad range of signatories to the motion before the House.  We had five of the hooded men down to brief Members in the AV room.  They also met the T&aacute;naiste on that day.  I thank him for taking the time to meet them.  I have no doubt that he appreciates the nuances and global significance of the judgment and how it has been utilised and abused by other states internationally.  That is why this appeal is so fundamentally important.<\/p> <p>While I have the floor, I will take the opportunity to read into the record of the House the names of the 14 hooded men, namely, Jim Auld, Pat Shivers, Joe Clarke, Michael Donnelly, Kevin Hannaway, Paddy Joe McLean, Francie McGuigan, Patrick McNally, Sean McKenna, Gerry McKerr, Michael Montgomery, Davy Rodgers, Brian Turley and  Liam Shannon, who is with us tonight.  Behind each of those men is a family and a lived experience of that awful time and of the legacy of the torture they and so many others endured in those much darker days of our conflict.  Sometimes legacy issues and cases lose their edge and pointedness, but legacy is a lived experience, not just for these men but also for all of those affected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Senator Norris noted, many people have been hurt and affected by the conflict, and we want to see a scenario where all of these people have access to truth and justice moving forward.

The Minister of State said in his summing up that the Government is carefully considering this issue.  It is important and I wish it well in its deliberations.  I hope it knows that when it is dealing with the hooded men and their families, these men have campaigned for 50 years.  They have been to every court not just in this land but beyond.  These men endure.  These men suffered the horrific torture we have outlined, and we cannot do service to the way they can outline their experiences, which is why the briefing and the meeting with the T&aacute;naiste were so important.  These men will continue to campaign and they have our full support, endorsement and solidarity.  They have our full best wishes in the sure and certain knowledge that we all know in this House that those men were tortured.  All they ask, and other colleagues have said why it is so important, is this is rightly recognised for what it was.  I said in my earlier contribution that it really affected me and hit me when Francie McGuigan, one of the hooded men, very simply stated during the course of the briefing that the British should wear the label of torturers on the international stage because that is what they were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#ZZ00400","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526463000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#AAA00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1526463000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>At 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051600002#AAA00400","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526463000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 6.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 May 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
