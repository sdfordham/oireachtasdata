It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity. <br\/><br\/>Looking beyond 2020, EU climate and energy proposals point to the need to expand the renewable generation portfolio. To that end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), published earlier this year, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the medium to long term of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that at least 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to 2020, which is available my Department&rsquo;s website, estimates that approximately 50,000 electric vehicles (EVs) could form part of the transport fleet in 2020. However, the extent to which electric vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including,<i>inter alia<\/i>, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase. There are signs that these factors are improving and in 2014, thus far, there has been an increase in electric vehicle purchases through the grant scheme compared with previous years.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, in terms of achieving the levels of ambition for reducing greenhouse gas emissions envisaged for 2030, a range of measures in the transport sector, including additional electrification of the transport fleet and the use of alternative, low-carbon fuels, will likely be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100073#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategy for Renewable Energy","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100073#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[47350\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100073#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress that has been made regarding research into the development of ocean wave energy here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>Both wave and tidal energy are still at the research, development and demonstration stage globally and, while promising experimental devices have been developed, much research, development and demonstration is required to bring wave energy technology to commercial viability.

In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy, equating to 20.9% of electricity demand. To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. The total amount of wind generation connected to the grid is approximately 2,200 MW.

Based around Power Purchase Agreements between generators and electricity suppliers, REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a defined period. <\/p><p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity market and the grid connection process is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s (CER), which is an independent statutory body. It is necessary to notify ESB Networks in order to connect small scale hydro or wind electricity generation equipment to the distribution grid and a power purchase agreement with a supplier is required if surplus electricity is being sold.<\/p><p>  On a day to day basis, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides a range of business supports to both industry and SME's, covering energy management, training and advice.

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.

An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.

The sales process of the IBRC loan assets, including their segmentation to meet demand from international buyers, delivered a very positive result with over 90% of the loan assets (with a par value of &euro;21.7bn) sold.<br\/><br\/>Following instructions issued by me, NAMA were no longer obliged to purchase the unsold IBRC assets at their independent valuation as previously envisaged, as it became clear\u00a0that\u00a0the expected proceeds to be raised from the sale of the IBRC loan assets would\u00a0be sufficient to fully repay the IBRC debt to NAMA. <br\/><br\/>The Special Liquidators have therefore devised a further sales process in respect of the unsold loan assets so as to maximise the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State. This sales process is currently underway and the Special Liquidators are unable to quantify at this stage the total sales proceeds that will be achieved from this process. <br\/><br\/>As\u00a0the Special Liquidators maximise the proceeds of the\u00a0liquidation, it is important that they have a comprehensive view of the creditors who ultimately may be entitled to these proceeds. To this end, the Special Liquidators have published advertisements and written to those known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the liquidation. Creditors in the UK and Ireland have until 31 March 2015 to submit their claims and those creditors in the US have until 31 May 2015. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>Once all claims have been submitted, they will be reviewed in detail and adjudicated on by the Special Liquidators. In order to finalise this process, further information may be sought from some creditors in order to validate their claim. Should the junior bondholders submit a claim and it is found to be valid by the Special Liquidators,\u00a0then they will be legally entitled to a payment from the proceeds of the liquidation provided there are sufficient funds available for distribution\u00a0in line with their position in the hierarchy of creditor claims\u00a0. <br\/><br\/>The Special Liquidators are unable to comment at this stage both\u00a0on\u00a0the level of proceeds that will ultimately be generated from the liquidation and on the level of valid creditor\u00a0claims that will ultimately be received\u00a0in respect of the liquidation.  It is balance between the proceeds generated and level of valid claims that will ultimately determine the\u00a0dividend\u00a0to which\u00a0each creditor may\u00a0be entitled.  The ultimate level of dividend paid to each creditor cannot be known until such time as the sales processes are complete, the total level of adjudicated creditors is finalised and the other contingent creditor claims which may crystallise, including those from\u00a0litigation, are known.<br\/><br\/>It is understood that for the payment of proceeds from the liquidation,\u00a0unsecured creditors will rank in priority to the holders of subordinated debt. The priority for the distribution of assets under the Companies Acts is generally:<br\/><br\/>i. costs and expenses of the ongoing liquidation;<br\/><br\/>ii. preferential creditors, including certain taxes and employee and pension claims arising prior to the date of liquidation (these claims are certain to be paid in full)<br\/><br\/>iii. amounts owing to NAMA under the Facility Deed acquired from the Central Bank which were secured by a floating charge over the bank s assets (this debt is now fully repaid and so the floating charge is now released)<br\/><br\/>iv. unsecured creditors, including:<br\/><br\/>- Debts owing to the Minister\/NTMA under ELG and to DGS<br\/><br\/>- Unguaranteed debt\/depositors (including holders of tracker bonds etc.)<br\/><br\/>- Unknown, including:<br\/><br\/>- Local authority development bonds<br\/><br\/>- Suppliers \/ other  normal  unsecured creditors<br\/><br\/>- Employees that are not preferential creditors<br\/><br\/>- Contingent creditors and other potential costs principally relating to litigation etc.<br\/><br\/>v.  subordinated creditors<br\/><br\/>vi.

Since it was introduced in March 2009 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, the PRD has reduced the public sector pay bill by an estimated &euro;5.5 billion. In 2014 the PRD\u00a0reduced the cost of the public service pay bill by an estimated 6.1%. <\/p><p>  The nature of the Financial Emergency Measures legislation is that the powers granted by the Oireachtas under the legislation are temporary in nature and are predicated on\u00a0the continuing\u00a0financial emergency in the State. As provided for under section 12 of the FEMPI\u00a0Act 2013, I am required to review annually the Acts, and\u00a0a written report of my findings\u00a0is laid before each House of the Oireachtas.\u00a0\u00a0My last review was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 June 2014. In that review I concluded that there is a need to continue to apply the PRD to meet the required public expenditure targets.\u00a0It is worth restating that the expenditure proposals as set out in Budget 2015 are based, in part, on the revenue accruing from the PRD.<\/p><p>  However, it should be noted that a start has already been made in ameliorating the impact of PRD on public servants. As legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.<\/p><p>  As\u00a0the country moves, thankfully, into a more normal economic environment, a change we can already see is underway, I\u00a0believe it is important that I as\u00a0Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0give\u00a0consideration as to how, over the medium term, pay policy needs to develop in the public service to ensure that\u00a0overall fiscal targets will\u00a0be met.

The new scheme will offer a specific grant rate of 60 per cent compared to the standard grant rate of 40 per cent which will be generally available under other on-farm investment schemes. The specific areas of investment available to young farmers will include animal housing, slurry storage, dairy equipment, specialised slurry spreading equipment, animal welfare and farm safety, and specialised pig and poultry investments, as well as capital investments for organic farmers. In addition, young farmers will be able to avail of grant-aid for construction of new dairy buildings.<\/p><p>  These measures are complemented by a significant package of Young Farmer measures under Pillar 1 of CAP. Young Farmers and New Entrants will have priority access to the National Reserve which will be worth nearly &euro;25 million in 2015.

This is payable for a maximum period of five years. The &lsquo;five years&rsquo; is dated from the year of setting up of the holding in his\/her own name (i.e. from when the young farmer is allocated a herd-number). A young farmer who establishes a holding in early 2015 would receive the full five years of the Young Farmers payment.<\/p><p>  The Young Farmers Scheme payment will be payable up to a maximum of 50 entitlements.<\/p><p>  Ireland has selected the method of calculation which will give the maximum payment possible.

The preparation of a Sea Fisheries Sustainability Impact Assessment is provided for in the Programme for Government. To facilitate and inform these deliberations, an open consultation process was put in place, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2015. In addition, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on 26 of November which gave a further opportunity to key stakeholders to outline their position on the many aspects of this proposal. In all 5 submissions were received by the closure date. The specific details of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal and the impact of those for Ireland are available in the document which has been laid before the D&aacute;il and in the accompanying Stock Book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute.<\/p><p>  I presented the Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 2 December. In essence, I agreed with the sentiment in many of the contributions, which called for greater adherence to the available scientific advice to enable prudent and appropriate management decisions to be taken, allied with a concern about misapplication of some scientific advice. I do not agree with taking an overly narrow interpretation of some of the scientific advice. BIM estimate that if the Commission proposal is implemented without change, it would involve a net 20% cut in quotas for whitefish sector. Cuts to the pelagic stocks (herring, boarfish) are accepted by industry. BIM estimate that the direct value loss of the stocks covered by the SIA would be &euro;31m, of which &euro;18m is for the whitefish and prawn fleet. The indirect loss amounts to &euro;78m with potential impact on jobs of 500 to 600 losses \/ reduced hours.   <\/p><p>  I will not support cuts where reliable scientifically vetted additional information is available to inform the decision or where there is a real risk of generating higher discard levels than at present or where the proposal would lead to increased discarding of fish. There is a high cost from a social and economic perspective when quota cuts are proposed and we have to be satisfied that in every case these cuts are justifiable. Fishing ports and communities all around our coast are dependent on fisheries for their very survival.<\/p><p>  The Sustainability Impact Assessment was the subject of detailed discussion at the Oireachtas Committee, which will inform my negotiation position at the Fisheries Council. I will work closely with stakeholders and with other EU Ministers on stocks of common interest with a view to delivering quotas that are appropriate taking all concerns into account.<\/p><p>  With regard to maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the new Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.

and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 122 together.<\/p><p>  I should at the outset explain that the public offices in Burgh Quay service two separate functions &ndash; one dealing with non-EEA nationals seeking to register and renew their permission to be in the State, a function which is carried out by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and a separate function dealing with applicants for re-entry visas to allow for short trips outside the State, usually for holidays.  This latter function is carried out by staff of Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and it is in connection with this function rather than the registration function that the recent queries have arisen.<\/p><p>  Neither I, as Minister, nor my officials wish for any applicants for services provided by my Department to feel that they have to queue outside office hours for long periods, particularly in cold weather conditions.  In this particular case there is absolutely no need to do so because, unlike the registration functions, it is not a requirement of the re-entry visa applicants to turn up in person.  Applications may be made by registered post and many thousands of applications are processed annually in this way.  In addition, where applications are being made on behalf of a family, even in person, it is not necessary for the entire family to turn up at the public office - one member of the family may present the necessary paperwork and receive the visas.<\/p><p>  That being said, there has been, in the last two weeks, an unprecedented level of demand for re-entry visas in the run up to Christmas &ndash; well above volumes of previous years.  Given this sudden increase in demand, decisive action was taken with significant additional resources re-deployed to the re-entry visa office. The additional staff were deployed on two fronts. Firstly, to clear the volume of postal applications on hand as the delay in dealing with this no doubt caused concern for other applicants resulting in them feeling the need to queue and obtain their visa in person. The second task was to ensure that any person who came in person to the offices was dealt with on the same day.<\/p><p>  As a result of these measures, by last Sunday night, 7 December, all the postal applications on hand were dealt with and since Friday last, 5 December, all persons who have come to the public office have been dealt with on the same day. This will continue to be the case so there is no need to queue, especially overnight and I would urge applicants not to do so.<\/p><p>  INIS has regularly kept its website updated over the past week to inform applicants of the position and to stress that there is no need to queue outside its offices. This message has been also posted in its public office and has been relayed to NGOs.  My Press Office also issued an information note to the press earlier this week. Obviously, it takes some time for the message to get through and there is an understandable concern by applicants who want to get home for Christmas. All applicants who are entitled to a re-entry visa should be assured that they will have it in time to enable them to travel for the holiday period.<\/p><p>  On the broader question of improvements to systems and operations, a major reform of the delivery of immigration services is underway including the transfer of registration functions from the GNIB to INIS.  This presents opportunities to streamline both registration and visa re-entry services and INIS will be introducing on-line services as part of this process.  The introduction of on-line booking appointments will be prioritised for re-entry visas with the aim of its introduction in the first quarter of 2015.<\/p><p>  In relation to the registration process operated by the GNIB in Burgh Quay, this function is currently working normally with all callers being dealt with on the day so there is no requirement to queue for this service. In common with the re-entry system, the immigration service is also planning to introduce an online booking system for appointments as part of a wider plan to transfer the registration function from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS.<\/p><p>  Obviously, it would be ideal if all immigration related business could be done through the postal system (as can currently be done in the case of  re-entry visas) or through on-line services. However, in common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at the offices of the Minister. This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure. Accordingly, we must devise systems that meet the needs of our customers while at the same time maintaining appropriate checks and balances within the system. I believe the reform programme underway will achieve both of these aims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100085#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100085#WRO00450"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[47520\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100085#WRO00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; attached to Kinnegad Garda station, County Westmeath over the past four years and the future plans for the station.","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

The issue is being actively addressed by the Health Service Executive, through the work of the Special Delivery Unit.  Specific measures to address pressures on access to acute hospital care have been put in place.  These include observation of the National Waiting List Protocol, adherence to relevant HSE National Clinical Programme guidelines, and the implementation of new patient care pathways, such as medical assessment, minor and local injury units and urgent care centres to provide a spectrum of care which supports the efficient use of hospital resources. <\/p><p>  However, it is also important to recognise that for over-crowding to be successfully addressed, the wider hospital and the local community services must all respond appropriately.  The current and future challenge to sustaining a reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys will require a focus on additional use of Acute Medical Units and early referral to a senior medical doctor, specific care pathways for frail older persons and appropriate National Clinical Programme Models of Care to manage older persons and those with chronic illnesses in the home and community care settings.<\/p><p>  One of the most significant issues with regard to access to acute hospital care is delayed discharges.  There are over 800 patients in hospitals whose discharge from hospital has been delayed due to lack of funding to enable them to return home or to move into long term care.  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges.  This funding will be targeted at hospital and community services which can demonstrate initiatives to address specific needs of delayed discharge patients most positively and therefore improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  An extra &euro;3 million was allocated in this year's Supplementary Budget for Health to allow the delayed discharge initiative to start this year, rather than next year as originally intended.  This initiative will enable many of these patients to move from acute or transitional care into long term care or to return home with appropriate supports and will help to alleviate pressures on acute hospital bed capacity.<\/p><p>  The Department and HSE Divisions of Acute Hospitals, Primary Care and Social Care will work collaboratively to ensure that any funding provided will target delayed discharges and encourage Acute Hospitals and Community Healthcare Organisations to work together to resolve the issue.  I am also re-establishing the Emergency Department Forum, which will meet monthly in order to develop solutions to problems being experienced by Emergency Departments, with the emphasis on those which are experiencing the greatest levels of difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100089#WRS00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100089#WRS00950"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[47526\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100089#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will have their eye operation carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2014,<\/i>has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

Taking full account of the more comprehensive information from the Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry, Ireland has amongst the lowest levels of maternal mortality in the developed world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100090#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug and Alcohol Task Forces","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100091#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[47607\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100091#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the work of the western regional drugs task force; the funding provided to them in 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; the proposed funding for 2015; their area of operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>The Western Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Force (RDATF) assess the extent and nature of the drug problem in their area and coordinate action at local level so that there is a targeted response to the drug problem in local communities.

The vetting arrangements were updated in 2010 and are set out in Department Circular 0063\/2010 which clarifies the requirements for Garda vetting as part of recruitment procedures for all teaching and non-teaching positions. It is the responsibility of each relevant school authority to have in place the necessary policy and procedures to ensure compliance with this circular.  Given that such matters are dealt with at individual school level, the detailed breakdown that is sought by the Deputy is not available centrally within my Department.<\/p><p>  The level of vetting carried out for teachers can be gauged from data from the Teaching Council which shows that the number of teachers vetted under the non-statutory arrangements continues to steadily increase. There are 90,121 teachers on the Teaching Council register and 53,753 of them have been vetted. This represents about 60% of the teachers on the register.<\/p><p>  The remaining balance of 36,368 that are not vetted are typically permanent teachers who have been in the same school since prior to 2006. Over the years the lack of capacity in the Garda Central Vetting Unit has been an impediment to getting all these existing teachers vetted.<\/p><p>  The Garda Central Vetting Unit indicated to the Department, at a meeting in July 2014, that it now has capacity to vet these remaining teachers that were never vetted. However, if this is done now under the current non-statutory vetting arrangements it would be confined to a check for criminal offences.<\/p><p>  The forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements will set out the requirements for vetting of new employees and for the retrospective vetting of existing employees.  The statutory vetting arrangements include a check for relevant &quot;soft information&quot; which is an important new aspect of the vetting arrangements. &quot;Soft information&quot; is referred to as &quot;specified information&quot; in the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012 and is information other than criminal convictions held by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where such information leads to a bona-fide belief that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons.<\/p><p>  Given that the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements will include a check for both criminal offences and also any relevant &quot;soft information&quot; the Department considers that at this stage it is better from a child protection perspective to wait for the vetting of these teachers to be done under the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements. This will also dovetail with the amendments that are being made to the Teaching Council Act which include:<\/p><p>(a) Linking compliance with the vetting arrangements with renewal of registration<\/p><p>(b) Strengthening the Fitness to Teach provisions so as to provide an appropriate mechanism for assessing a teacher's fitness to remain on the register if a vetting disclosure received in respect of a teacher indicates any potential risk of harm to a child. Removal of a teacher from the Teaching Council register is the best way of achieving child protection across all schools.<\/p><p>  It is intended that all registered teachers will be vetted under the statutory vetting arrangements as soon as possible after the legislation is commenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100093#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100093#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[47616\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121100093#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if extra resource teaching hours will be provided in respect of a child (details supplied) in Dublin 13.","asker":"1021","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":491,"content":"<p>All schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to provide for children with special educational or learning support needs through general allocation processes.<\/p><p>  Additionally, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.

Pobal manage the LCDP on behalf of my Department and currently provide funding to Donegal LDC to implement the LCDP. In 2014 &euro;1,301,117 of LCDP funding was provided to Donegal LDC.<br\/><br\/>Details of funding paid by Donegal LDC to individual local community and voluntary groups under the LCDP, and previous programmes, have been held in a number of formats and systems, which are not readily available and would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work to compile. <br\/><br\/>Donegal LDC also received funding from my Department under the Dormant Accounts Fund of &euro;27,000 in 2007 and &euro;3,000 in 2008. This was under the Recreation and Development funding measure to support disadvantaged young people. The information in relation to this funding is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. <br\/><br\/>My Department contracted Donegal LDC in 2009 to deliver the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) in parts of Donegal. On foot of a legal challenge by another EU Member State, the European Court of Justice prohibited the publication of beneficiary details. Because of this judgement Ireland has only published details of payments to the Local Action Groups that administer the Programme. In January 2014, this issue was resolved and lists of beneficiaries under the RDP, in respect of 2014 EU financial year, will be published in May 2015.<br\/><br\/>Funding was also provided to Donegal LDC under the LEADER+ and National Rural Development Programme 2000-2006 and a list of the beneficiaries is detailed below.<table><tr><th><div><b>Name<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Amount<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>LEADER+ Training<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ardara Parents Comm. <\/td><td><div>&euro;6,681 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ballytour Participants <\/td><td><div>&euro;17,280 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Development Course <\/td><td><div>&euro;9,200 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dunfanaghy Youth Group <\/td><td><div>&euro;6,000 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal Youth Council <\/td><td><div>&euro;29,694 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tuath <\/td><td><div>&euro;36,500 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Smallholders Working Group (DLDC Ltd) <\/td><td><div>&euro;5,870 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Daybreak <\/td><td><div>&euro;29,814 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal Mountain Rescue Team <\/td><td><div>&euro;10,630 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEADERship Training (DLDC 03) <\/td><td><div>&euro;17,471 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Organic Training for Future Farmers <\/td><td><div>&euro;8,892 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal Youth Council <\/td><td><div>&euro;6,871 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Smallholders Working Group (DLDC 18) <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,725 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>LEADER+ Analysis and Development<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bundoran W.E.

The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Figures for 2013 show that 20.9% of electricity demand was met from renewables.To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2013, 16.5% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was in excess of 2,200 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. <br\/><br\/>The October European Council endorsed a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. In addition, an EU target of at least 27% is set for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030, and an indicative target at the EU level of at least 27% is set for improving energy efficiency in 2030 compared to projections of future energy consumption.<br\/><br\/>Ireland intends to make a cost-effective, achievable and fair (in terms of effort sharing among Member States), contribution to these high level EU goals.

EVs currently on the market are offering ranges under 200km per charge. This compares to ranges of approximately 170km two to three years ago. It is expected that similar evolutionary increases in range will continue through improved battery technology and vehicle design. Such increases in range will impact on the longer term requirements for charging capability such as public charging points and I understand that this is being monitored by the ESB.
