There is, at this stage, little doubt about that. Determining the full impact of such a complex scenario is, however, extremely difficult, especially given that much would depend on the exact terms of a future UK relationship with the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we are working across Government to improve our understanding of the various issues that might arise for Ireland in the event of a fundamental change in the EU-UK relationship.  The Department of the Taoiseach has a leading role in this process and my Department is heavily involved, including through our Embassy in London, our Consulate General in Edinburgh and our offices in Northern Ireland.  Other Departments are also playing their part.<\/p>  <p>  One obvious area that could be significantly affected is the performance of our economy.  A study by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which was commissioned by the Department of Finance, was very clear on this point.  That study also highlighted other challenges that might arise, including in terms of migration and in the energy sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is also the Government&rsquo;s view that a UK departure from the Union could be damaging for Northern Ireland in particular.  That is because the EU has been a force for good for everyone in the North, whether through supporting the peace process or by helping to create jobs and employment.  I recently spoke at a seminar in Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast in which I elaborated on those points and explained why I believed continued EU membership is in the interests of the people there.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully recognises that we must be prepared for any scenario, including the possibility that the UK may ultimately opt to leave the EU.  However, our priority is doing all we can to ensure the UK remains in the Union in the first place.  We will continue to work towards that goal, especially as we enter a crucial period of EU negotiations on a potential package of reforms acceptable to the UK and all EU Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Migration Crisis","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[45306\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"to report on the European Union-Turkey migration agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>On 29 November, the Taoiseach attended an EU heads of state or government meeting with Turkey, at which it was agreed to activate the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan aimed at managing the current refugee and migrant crisis, as well as several further shared commitments and actions.<\/p><p>The Joint Action Plan contains short- and medium-term measures to be undertaken by the European Union and Turkey.

The Government believes that since the Committee of Ministers decided to close its consideration of individual measures in March 2009, new and significant information has come to light through the 2011 de Silva review that supports our call for the reopening of individual measures on this case.  Our support for reopening is reinforced by the Declaration of the Belfast High Court on 8 September 2015 which stated that as of March 2009, the date of the Committee of Ministers&rsquo; decision closing individual measures, there had been no effective investigation in compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, having regard to the obligation of the Committee of Ministers under Article 46(2) to supervise the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, the logical and appropriate action for the Committee to take would be to reopen the individual measures pending the outcome of the on-going police investigation which is currently reviewing the new and significant information discovered by the de Silva review.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the ongoing domestic proceedings in the UK in relation to this case, the Government agreed that it would be prudent for the Committee to postpone its decision on reopening individual measures until the outcome of these legal proceedings are known.  This decision took account of the practice within the Council of Europe that the Committee of Ministers should avoid making any findings in a case which is subject to proceedings in domestic courts.  I look forward to the Committee of Ministers resuming its consideration on reopening individual measures once the outcome of the ongoing appeals are known and I would note in this regard that the Committee has decided, in any event, to return to the Pat Finucane case, as part of the McKerr Group of cases, by June 2016 at the latest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA03600"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[45471\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any consultations with his European Union colleagues with regard to Saudi Arabia's human rights record, including, in particular, recent reports of multiple beheadings, and the advisability of maintaining close diplomatic and economic relations with that state in view of its human rights record; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>Human rights issues form a continuous part of EU discussions on third party countries, be it at EU Ministerial level or among EU representatives in the countries concerned.

These events are in addition to those I mentioned in my previous response to the Deputy, intended to be representative rather than exhaustive, and do not take account of the Embassy network&rsquo;s broader promotion of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; on social media or in an informal manner in the context of other events that promote Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Norway has promoted the &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; campaign via the organisation of a roundtable event with several Norwegian tour operators in conjunction with Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Nordic branch office. As part of this discussion there was a particular focus on the &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; promotion.<\/p>  <p>  Further afield, the Embassy of Ireland in China has worked with Tourism Ireland on promoting &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; since June 2015.  Tourism Ireland launched this destination during this year's China Sales Mission which took place in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu.  In addition, a bespoke trade and consumer ezine themed on &lsquo;Ireland's Ancient East&rsquo; was widely circulated in September.<\/p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Australia works with Tourism Ireland to promote tourism generally.  During Canberra&rsquo;s annual multicultural festival in February 2015, &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; was promoted at the Ireland stand.  More recently, the Deputy Consul General in Sydney attended a key trade event held at Sydney Tower on 2 November 2015 in which Tourism Ireland promoted &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  On a more general level, Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Mission to UNESCO in Paris assists in obtaining UNESCO recognition of appropriate sites in Ireland, which could include sites falling under the region covered by &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, there are plans in train for promotion of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; in 2016, including across the key German market and, in February, the Embassy of Ireland in Denmark will support a Tourism Ireland-hosted workshop in Copenhagen aimed at the whole Scandinavian travel industry which will mark the official launch of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; in the Nordic region.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, Tourism Ireland in China will continue to promote Ireland's Ancient East through trade, digital and publicity channels.  The month long St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival, which is organised in several major cities by Team Ireland in China, will provide a major platform for promoting Ireland, including all of its tourism destinations.  Promotional material highlighting &lsquo;Ireland's Ancient East&rsquo; will be provided to partners in the travel industry during sales calls and at trade training sessions throughout 2016.  In the second half of 2016 there will be an online campaign focussed on the region.<\/p>  <p>  In South Africa, at the AGM of the Embassy-supported BISA (Business Ireland Southern Africa) network in Pretoria on Friday 13 November, the Tourism Ireland agent based in South Africa presented &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; to the representatives present from Irish Business Networks in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Harare.<\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy has specific thoughts on how the Embassy network, working closely with the State agencies and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, might additionally promote or showcase &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; and other tourism initiatives, I would be very happy to discuss these with her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Death Penalty","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[45415\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700056#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is aware of the case of a person (details supplied) who has been sentenced to death by Kenyan authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>Ireland has a longstanding policy of strong opposition to the death penalty and we are actively engaged in international efforts, including through the EU, to secure its universal abolition.<\/p>  <p>  Along with our EU partners, Ireland actively supports UN resolutions on the death penalty at the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.

Two such RIAs have been published since March 2011.

This RIA is available at  .<\/p><p>The other RIA relates to the measures to provide for the transposition of certain aspects of Directive 2010\/41\/EU on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, in so far as they relate to ensuring that the spouse or civil partner of a self-employed worker can benefit from social protection in accordance with national law.  The amendments necessary to transpose these provisions are contained in section 19 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014.  This RIA is available at .<\/p><p>In addition, Part 4 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 implemented the recommendations of the Critical Review of the Pensions Board.  This review, which involved a public consultation process, was carried out under the Public Service Reform plan.  This review is available at .<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for changes in the manner in which the resources of a defined benefit pension scheme are distributed on the wind up of a pension scheme.  On the publication of this Bill, the Department of Social Protection also published a report by Mercer on the changes to occupational pensions.  This report undertook a detailed modelling exercise of different approaches to the changes to the order of priority given to the disbursement of assets when a defined benefit pension scheme winds up.

The Gender Recognition Act 2015 provided for the formal legal recognition of a person's preferred gender.

The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports community companies that operate on a community business or social enterprise model.  Companies supported by the CSP generate and use income from the services they provide to pay staff, meet overhead costs and to contribute to future development.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage cost on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are 398 active contracts in place with community companies at a cost of &euro;42 million per annum.  The Programme directly supports 2,110 full-time positions.  Of these positions, a financial contribution of &euro;32,000 per annum is made to support the employment of managers, of which there are 312 currently.  Funds are also provided as a contribution to the cost of employing people in some 1,800 full-time equivalent positions.  The Department estimates that some 2,800 people are employed across these companies with direct CSP support.  Another 1,100 people are employed in these companies without public funding support.  Additionally, the companies provide some 1,500 work placements through CE, the Rural Social Scheme and T&uacute;s.  These companies are valuable to the social fabric of the country and provide very good quality services, particularly in poorer urban areas and rural villages where services are not widely available. <\/p>  <p>  Since the CSP became operational in 2006, it has helped companies to move from a situation where the minimum wage was paid to a position today where 60% of employees are paid above this level.  The Department is committed to working with the remaining companies to work towards paying a reasonable wage.  The resurgent economy will support this move.  A core requirement of the Programme is that service providers generate non-public revenues from their operations by the sale of goods, charging fees for services delivered or fundraising.  <\/p>  <p>  Companies in contract with CSP must be not-for-profit, social enterprise or community business in nature.  This does not mean that they should not aspire to make reasonable returns from their activities that allow for a good wage to be paid.  The CSP operates very clearly on the basis that it provides a &ldquo;contribution only&rdquo; to offset the wage costs of service provision.  However, it is entirely a matter for each service provider to set their own wage levels.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that some 45% of non-management staff are paid the minimum wage in companies in contract to the CSP, contrary to the requirements of the programme to pay the local pay rate.  Ten percent were paid above the proposed living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour and the remaining 45% are paid between these ranges.

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow's\/Widower's\/Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for a Widow's or Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension, either the person claiming or their late spouse or civil partner must have a certain number of PRSI contributions.  All the PRSI requirements must be met on one person's record - one may not combine the contributions of either spouses or civil partners.  All must have been made before the death of the spouse or civil partner.  Virtually all PRSI contributions count towards this pension, including contributions paid by public servants and the self-employed. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for such a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple pensions.  There is, therefore, a principle of one person, one payment, which generally applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.<\/p>  <p>  While there may be other arrangements regarding private pensions, those pensions would not generally have the solidarity based provisions common to social welfare pensions, nor the high level of State subsidy which exists for schemes financed by the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Amending the State pensions system, to allow two pensions be paid to one person, would be a significant change to the system, providing one person with the pension income of two people, and would greatly increase the cost of the scheme.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments.  I have no plans to introduce such a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700058#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Implementation","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700058#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[46030\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700058#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the per-client fee that Seetec or Turas Nua will receive at the different stages.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[46031\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700058#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the per-client fee for the harder-to-place category and for the easier-to-place category.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together. <\/p>  <p>  JobPath is a new approach to employment activation that will support people who are long-term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.

These contributions entitle them to access social insurance benefits, including State pension (contributory), widow\/widower or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension, guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  In contrast, a combined employer and employee rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of class A employees, who can then access the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker's benefit. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012 found that the effective annual rate of contribution for those on national average earnings, needed to provide the core full-rate State Pension (Contributory), (which is the main benefit currently available to self-employed contributors), is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  The Review also found that: <\/p>  <p>  - An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if Jobseekers Benefit in addition to core State Pension (Contributory) is provided.<\/p>  <p>  - The average contribution rate required for the core State Pension (Contributory) plus the Invalidity Pension is estimated to be in the region of 17%. <\/p>  <p>  Using a number of assumptions based on the existing population of contributors and beneficiaries, the report estimated the full year incremental costs of extending Jobseekers Benefit and Invalidity Pension to the self-employed, stated in 2016 terms, to be &euro;76m and &euro;93m respectively.  This was based on the assumption that the incidence rate of benefit is the same as that applying to the overall population and assuming the extended scheme reaches full &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; in terms of the numbers of additional beneficiaries with immediate effect.  Access to these benefits, and accordingly the costs associated with these benefits, would not arise in Year 1 as entitlement to such benefits can only be established on the basis of contributions paid in prior years.<\/p>  <p>  In its 2013 report, the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare considered issues related to extending social insurance coverage to the self-employed in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for Jobseeker's Benefit.  It found that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed persons who claimed the means tested jobseekers allowance during the three-year period from 2009-2011 received payment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Group did, however, find that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases relating to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and partial capacity benefit schemes.  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only. <\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Group also examined the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed on an optional basis.  It considered that allowing people a facility to opt in or out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks.  The whole principle of social insurance is social solidarity where everybody pays in and, if needed, cover is available.  Allowing people to opt in or out could result in a negation of the social solidarity and contributory principles which underline the social insurance system. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with those self-employed who might opt to pay Class A PRSI on a voluntary basis.  While I am anxious to expand the level of social insurance entitlement for the self-employed, any such change would have to be funded by an appropriate level of contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700058#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Measures","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700058#WRC05900"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[46087\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700058#WRC06000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average cost of activating a person who is unemployed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>For each client the Department of Social Protection uses a different combination of the key elements of the activation model, according to the age (under or over 25), probability of exiting the live register (low, medium or high PEX score), length of unemployment (long term or short term). <\/p>  <p>  The first intervention occurs immediately after the client is selected for activation.

An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on 39 hour week. <\/p><p>Strand II is based on the total number of disabled employees in a company, an employer can apply for a grant to cover additional costs ranging from an additional 10% for 3-6 employees to a maximum of 50% of the wage subsidy for 23+ disabled employees.<\/p><p>Strand III is where 30 or more disabled people are employed, employers can avail of a grant of &euro;30,000 per annum to assist with the cost of employing an Employment Assistance Officer.<\/p><p>Unlike other recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus, WSS is payable indefinitely as long as the disabled person remains in the employment concerned.

The IIF completed a second investment in 2013 when it acquired Towercom, Ireland's largest independent wireless telecoms infrastructure company. The IIF's most recent investment was completed in July 2015, when it acquired the concession contract to operate and maintain The Convention Centre Dublin, with the investment also including a license to build and operate an approximately 330-bed hotel on a site adjacent to The Convention Centre.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The IIF has in the course of 2015 secured investor commitments to over &euro;400 million, including the ISIF commitment, with 14 institutional investors participating in the funding round to complete the most recent CCD investment.\u00a0The IIF has an on-going pipeline of investment opportunities that it is actively evaluating and it is currently hoped that an additional investment will be undertaken in the coming months. The IIF is also continuing to meet with both domestic and international investors with a view to raising additional capital.<\/p>  <p>  Information on the economic impact of ISIF's investments, including employment, is published on a bi-annual basis.

This is\u00a0due to\u00a0the new Deposit Guarantee Regulations\u00a0(S.I. No. 516 of 2015) requiring annual contributions to be made to\u00a0a new\u00a0deposit contributory fund\u00a0established under these regulations. The requirement is to build the deposit contributory\u00a0fund\u00a0up to a level of 0.8% of covered deposits (circa &euro;680m)\u00a0of all credit institutions\u00a0authorised in the State by 3\u00a0July 2024.

A meeting took place on 5 October, 2015 between the OPW and KCC at which these matters were discussed. <\/p>  <p>  It was explained by the OPW at this meeting that at both of these locations old Land Commission embankments protect private dwellings, some constructed in relatively recent times. It was confirmed to the Council that OPW is not responsible for the upkeep of these embankments. Funding of &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 for both of these locations was granted to KCC in 2012 under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation And Coastal Protection Scheme and these were the maximum possible amounts that could be approved under the Scheme's criteria having regard to the information submitted by KCC in its application.  <\/p>  <p>  Also, following the coastal storms which affected the western seaboard in December 2013 and January 2014, KCC requested funding for strengthening works at Incherea, Glenbeigh and both repair and strengthening works at Cromane Lower. The Council was advised by the OPW that strengthening works were outside of the scope of the Government Decision allocating funding for storm damage repairs and that only the repair element of projects, such as that at Cromane Lower, were covered under the allocation. The OPW approved KCC's programme of repair works, which included &euro;30,000 for Cromane Lower which amount has been drawn down by KCC.<\/p>  <p>  If, following assessment, the Council considers that economically and technically viable measures and works are possible at the locations in question then it may undertake such works using its own resources or, if necessary, it may submit applications under the OPW's Minor Works Scheme. Any application received will be assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding for flood risk management.

Minister English is also attending the parallel EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) which takes place in Nairobi. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s priorities are represented by the EU position negotiated at the Ministerial Conference.  Ireland, along with the other 27 Member States, believes that agreeing on a balanced and ambitious outcome on export competition (which includes export subsidies; export credits; state trade enterprises and food aid) would constitute an important step forward in the process of creating a stronger and fairer multilateral trading system, especially for Developing and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).  Ireland also supports an agreement on a &ldquo;development package&rdquo; following on from the ninth Ministerial Conference, comprising of (i) better duty-free, quota-free access; (ii) enhanced services waiver; (iii) streamlined rules of origin and (iv) greater market access for cotton producing countries, as well as work on Food Security.

There has been one significant instance of shared co-operation between both Agencies some years ago, to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor.  This led to the jointly developed North West Business Technology Zone (NWBTZ), which involved a total expenditure of &euro;39m on developing infrastructure and property solutions in both centres, including the development of a state of the art Business and Technology Park in Letterkenny.

I also note that the Deputy&rsquo;s party proposed such a Zone in a policy document earlier this year.<\/p><p>The possible development of a Border Development Zone could raise significant issues involving EU State Aid Rules and other EU provisions and it would also, of course, require detailed negotiations between both Administrations on this island.  There would also be significant resource issues, which would be challenging. I am not aware that detailed costings have been carried out in relation to the proposal. I expect that these would obviously depend of the exact nature and functions of such a body. As you will be aware, this Government have initiated a significant reduction in the number of Bodies and Agencies, in order to achieve more effective administration and delivery of services, so that a very strong case needs to be made to justify the creation of new bodies. I would again emphasise that any new structures to be put in place would require the full agreement of the Northern Ireland authorities.  Both administrations on the island are focussed on developing the existing mechanisms and on making them work better.<\/p><p>Developing new, regionally-based, economic structures could be a significant policy development, and one requiring careful consideration. The need to avoid duplication would be paramount, in the interests of utilising scarce State resources efficiently.  It is therefore worth noting that there are already several mechanisms in place to pursue cross border economic development.<\/p><p>I strongly believe that we should continue to build on the structures already in place and on what has been achieved in that region.

My Department jointly funds and provides oversight to this Body, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast, and it represents a very effective mechanism for tackling business development on an all-island basis.

My aim in publishing the draft Scheme was to get as wide a range of responses as possible from consumers and traders in view of the fact that its provisions will affect virtually every business and citizen in the State. The responses to the gift card provisions in particular raised a substantial number of issues, some of which have required further engagement by my Department with stakeholders. In addition to concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates, the responses have highlighted the need to ensure regulatory clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011. The consideration of other provisions of the draft Scheme has had to take account of EU legislative proposals on digital content and online and distance sale of goods published on 9 December 2015.

A second tariff offer covering trade in goods was exchanged and both sides have now arrived at proposals covering 97% of tariff lines.  Progress in this area will provide momentum in other areas of the negotiations.  There was also discussion in relation to public procurement and it is envisaged that there will be an exchange of market access proposals on public procurement by February 2016.<\/p><p>The negotiations also provided an opportunity to clarify some of the main principles of regulatory cooperation.  These included the fact that any cooperation is possible only if the level of protection for consumers stays the same or improves and any form of regulatory cooperation will not change or affect the EU regulatory and democratic process. <\/p><p>  During this round, the EU presented its first legal textual proposal for a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development, including labour and the environment, which covers conservation, sustainable management of resources, wildlife, forestry and fisheries, as well as other substantive matters including opportunities for joint initiatives in third countries to further labour rights and environmental protection.  The European Commission published this proposal on its website on the 6 November 2015.<\/p><p>On the 12 November 2015, the EU Commission published and formally presented to the US its proposal for a new and more transparent system for resolving disputes between investors and states &ndash; the Investment Court System.  This proposal is the outcome of a lengthy public consultation process with the Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and the public.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal aims at safeguarding Government&rsquo;s right to regulate and creates a new system composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  The proposal also includes additional improvements on access to the new system by small and medium sized companies. <\/p><p>An EU-US agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  Owing to our position as a small open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  The key findings of the Copenhagen Economics study, published on the 27 March 2015, are very positive for Ireland indicating a potential impact on the Irish economy of 1.1% increase in GDP.

Earlier this year I launched the <i>Action Plan for Jobs for the South West<\/i>(Cork and Kerry). The aim is to develop the full potential of that region for enterprise and job creation, building upon its specific local assets and areas of competitive advantage. The primary objective of this Plan is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in the region by 2020 and to ensure that the unemployment rate is within 1 per cent of the State average. Achieving this goal in the South West will contribute to the overall ambition of creating sustainable full employment in Ireland from 2018 onwards. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700067#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700067#WRM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[45909\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700067#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of assistance being provided by Enterprise Ireland for a potential enterprise (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>At the request of Deputy Griffin, Enterprise Ireland (EI) met a marine business in County Kerry who wanted to provide specialist training for ships' crews.

All regions have experienced jobs growth, but the rate of progress in some regions is less than in others. That is why the Government is placing an increased emphasis on supporting job creation in the regions this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs Initiative was launched by Government in February of this year. The purpose of this initiative is to identify a range of actions over the period 2015 - 2017 aimed at facilitating each region to achieve its economic potential and raise employment levels in each of the regions.  <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs for the Mid East region, which includes Athy, is currently under development and is expected to be launched in early 2016.  As with other plans, it will include a series of practical actions, developed in collaboration with regional stakeholders, to support enterprise growth and job creation across the Mid East region and enable the region as a whole to realise its economic potential and create jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of each of the plans published to date is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate of each region is within one per cent of the State average. Key targets in the Regional Action Plans published to date are to increase the number of entrepreneurs\/start-ups in each region by a minimum of 25%, improve the 5-year survival rate by 25% and improve scaling performance of companies by 25%. <\/p>  <p>  All regional Action Plans will be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next five years, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland.  The intention is that a further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be made available over the next five years through three competitive calls to be administered by Enterprise Ireland. These competitive calls will be targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support job creation across the regions.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2014, a new Regional aid map was published, providing details of areas of the country in which the State can grant State aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses to support development and employment. Under the revised map, Athy has been included as an eligible area. This presents a significant opportunity for developing businesses, supporting employment, and growing the enterprise base in Athy. Regional aid can be given to businesses to support new investment and new employment in productive projects, and can also be provided under schemes for tourism grants, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2011, there were 18,207 people recorded on the Live Register in Kildare County. This number has since fallen to 13,851 as at November 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have also placed an increased emphasis on the regions in their new corporate strategies.  Enterprise Ireland works with entrepreneurs and business people across the full business development spectrum - from early-stage entrepreneurs, to established business owners and Irish multinational companies.  Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Meanwhile, the Local Enterprise Offices are committed to providing consistent supports for microenterprises across all regions and acting as a first-stop-shop in delivering business growth and jobs for the small and micro-enterprise sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700068#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700068#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[46156\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700068#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of innovation vouchers awarded to companies based in County Waterford.","asker":"1091","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>The Enterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher Initiative was introduced in 2007 in order to drive an on-going innovation culture shift within small enterprise by promoting and encouraging knowledge transfer between Ireland&rsquo;s public knowledge providers and the small business community and creating greater synergies between the two.

Employment in EI and IDA supported firms has grown by over 40,000 since 2012.<\/p>  <p>  We set a target in 2012 to increase employment by 100,000 by 2016.

We started the process of rebuilding the capacity of the regions with the launch of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs this year.

The enterprise agencies and the LEOs will use their budgets in the optimal way to deliver on the potential for enterprise growth in the regions. In addition, earlier this year, we announced additional funding to support implementation of the regional Action Plans of &euro;250m over the coming years.  This comprises &euro;150m of investment by IDA Ireland in advanced property solutions in the regions and &euro;100m in competitive funding through Enterprise Ireland to support community enterprise initiatives, innovative initiatives by the Local Enterprise Offices and to support regional collaborative and clustering initiatives by public and private sector bodies and enterprises.     <\/p>  <p>  Our objective is to establish vibrant ecosystems for entrepreneurship, to stimulate clusters of scale and international visibility in areas of strength and to ensure that Ireland and our regions continue to be the best places to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all and we will direct available resources accordingly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700069#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700069#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[46420\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700069#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of properties that have been established as development units for enterprise start-ups and the costs incurred in acquiring these, by county.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>There are a range of initiatives for the provision of space for start-up companies.

It sets out the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives as a facilitator within the Irish entrepreneurship ecosystem.  It covers the six key elements that impact on entrepreneurs and start-ups and signposts the direction that policy will take in the coming years. This Policy Statement has as one of its stated high level objectives that &quot;we will ensure that greater numbers of people, particularly in underrepresented cohorts such as females, youths and older persons, start and run their own business&quot;.<\/p><p>The Policy Statement sets out the six elements of the ecosystem for entrepreneurship as: <\/p><p>- culture, human capital and education; <\/p><p>- business environment and supports; <\/p><p>- innovation; <\/p><p>- access to finance; <\/p><p>- entrepreneurial networks and mentoring; and <\/p><p>- access to markets. <\/p><p>It contains 96 key actions across a range of Government Departments and Agencies, which are designed to deliver improvements across the entire ecosystem.  The ambition of the Policy Statement is to increase the number of startups by 25%, to increase the survival rate in the first five years and to improve the capacity to scale by 25% and early indications are that progress is being made on this ambition.  <\/p><p>In terms of my own Department and its Agencies a number of supports are available, for those considering starting a business, regardless of age.  In relation to business start-ups and expansions in the micro and small business sector the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the First Stop Shop for access to advice and support for this business cohort.  Supports available include:<\/p><p>- Start-your-own-business training courses,<\/p><p>- Market research information,<\/p><p>- Business planning advice and templates,<\/p><p>- Access to experienced business mentors, and<\/p><p>- Feasibility grants and co-investment for your plans.<\/p><p>In addition to accessing the mainstream supports from the LEOs &ndash; where eligible &ndash; young entrepreneurs were specifically targeted with the roll-out of the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition in 2014 and 2015. The aim of IBYE is to promote entrepreneurship as a career choice and to encourage young people to set up new businesses which will ultimately create jobs. <\/p><p>The competition was open to people aged between the ages of 18-30. First time entrepreneurs were well catered for in the context of the IBYE programme. A &euro;50,000 Investment Fund was made available to each of the 31 LEOs to run the competition in their area in line with the following three categories:<\/p><p>- Best Business Idea: companies that are not yet trading, <\/p><p>- Best Start-Up Business: companies that have already started trading but in business for up to 24 months, and <\/p><p>- Best Established Business: companies that are in business more than 24 months.<\/p><p>The National Final was held on 6<sup>th<\/sup>December last from which a national winner in each category was selected in addition to selecting an overall winner as &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur 2015&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The LEOs also run the highly successful and well established Student Enterprise Awards for second level students giving them the chance to set up and run their own business while at school.  Students experience the realities of entrepreneurship from coming up with their business idea and writing a business plan to producing the product, research the marketing, promoting the business and managing the books.  It opens up to second level student the possibility of starting their own business and seeing entrepreneurship as a career choice in years to come.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) offers a range of startup supports to entrepreneurs, regardless of age.  In 2011, EI launched the Competitive Start Fund as a direct response to the needs of early-stage client companies regarding financing in the startup and market-launch process.  2011 also saw the introduction of EI&rsquo;s High Potential Start-Ups (HPSU) Accelerated Growth Programme aimed at HPSUs to develop critical skills in international sales, raising finance and building teams.  Another key programme is EI&rsquo;s New Frontiers Programme which was developed to support entrepreneurs and accelerate the development of sustainable early stage businesses with strong employment and growth potential, and to provide a feedstock to EI&rsquo;s HPSU programme.  EI also regularly offers feasibility funding for business startups in various sectors and geographic regions to assist new startup companies or entrepreneurs, to investigate the viability of a new growth-orientated business proposition which has the potential to become a HPSU.<\/p><p>I have no proposals to establish a standalone national office to support young business entrepreneurs aged 18&ndash;25 years as I believe that the existing Agencies of the State, through a variety of programmes and supports, are best placed to deliver the objectives and targets of the National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.  The Supporting SMEs online tool is a valuable resource that will signpost the range of programmes and supports available, and can be found at:  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700069#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700069#WRO01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700069#WRO01850"},{"type":"question","counter":659,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[45723\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700069#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 120 of 19 November 2015, if he has successfully raised the issue of strict new limits imposed on cadmium levels for live crab intended for export to China with the authorities in China; the level of dialogue which has taken place with the Chinese authorities; if the Chinese authorities have indicated that these new measures will be withdrawn; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":660,"content":"<p>Further to my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on 19 November 2015, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) issued a formal response to the communication from the Chinese authorities on Friday 27 November and circulated a copy of the response to representatives of the Irish live crab export industry.

This implementation of these measures has the potential to play a major role in the regeneration of agriculture in Ireland and will provide a solid basis for the industry in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Successful young farmer applicants to the National Reserve will receive an allocation of new entitlements on the basis of one entitlement for one hectare.  Applicants who already hold existing entitlements which are below the national average value will receive a top-up whereby the value of those entitlements will be increased to the national average value.  The National Reserve fund in 2015 is based on 3% of the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling, which is estimated at providing approximately &euro;24 million in funding.  Some 6,000 farmers applied under the Young Farmer category of the National Reserve and payments are currently being issued.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Young Farmers Scheme, young farmers will receive the payment under the scheme for a maximum period of five years.  The &lsquo;five years&rsquo; is dated from the year of setting up of the holding in his\/her own name.  The Young Farmers Scheme payment will be made on a maximum of 50 entitlements.  I have opted to use the maximum financing rate of 2% for the Young Farmers Scheme.  Funding of &euro;24 million is available under the scheme for 2015 and the same financing rate will be applied for the years 2016 to 2019.  I have selected the method of calculation which will give the maximum payment possible.  The payment will be calculated as 25% of the national average payment per hectare which is estimated will give a payment of approximately &euro;66 per entitlement held by the young farmer.  Some 8,500 farmers applied under the Young Farmer Scheme and payments to eligible applicants are currently being issued. <\/p>  <p>  I have also established a dedicated capital investment scheme for young farmers under TAMS II, offering a wider range of investment items than is generally available, and with an enhanced rate of aid of 60% as compared with the standard 4 0% grant. \u00a0A similar dedicated investment scheme is available for Organic farmers, with a range of items specific to organic production, and again offering a 60% rate of aid for young farmers.\u00a0 For any young farmers who do not meet the eligibility requirements for these dedicated schemes,\u00a0I have ensured that their applications will be prioritised under the mainstream TAMS schemes, which are open to all.   <\/p>  <p>  Last September I presented a six point plan, to both the EU Commissioner and my EU ministerial colleagues, to address the particularly acute situation in the dairy sector. I was extremely pleased that the final decision at Council took account of Ireland&rsquo;s requests and included the provision of targeted direct aid for dairy farmers,\u00a0which can be matched nationally.  The aid comprises &euro;13.7m of EU funding and a further &euro;13.7m in matching national funding.  The payment will be made on a flat rate basis with each of the 18,000 dairy farmers in the country receiving approximately &euro;1,350, with an additional &euro;800 top-up for young dairy farmers.  The flat rate payment will be made in the coming weeks and the young farmers&rsquo; top-up payment will be made in early 2016 when that scheme is finalised. <\/p>  <p>  The Agri-taxation Review was a joint initiative by the Minister for Finance and me, which was published as part of Budget 2015, and set out the main policy objectives for continuing support through agri-taxation measures including increasing land mobility and the productive use of land and assisting succession and the transfer of farms.  Both objectives are especially relevant to young farmers.   <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2016 continued the implementation of the Agri-taxation Review and a major new initiative on &lsquo;Family Transfer Partnerships&rsquo; to assist succession was announced. It is a structure in which family members enter into a partnership, and appropriate profit-sharing agreement, with the provision for the transfer of the family farm to the younger farmer at the end of a specified period (not exceeding ten years). To support this transfer a tax credit of up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per annum for five years can be allocated to the partnership, thereby incentivising the transfer and mitigating some of the financial concerns involved. The partnership model enables a gradual transfer of control and also facilitates knowledge transfer from one generation to another. In addition two measures specifically aimed at young farmers were renewed for a further three years &ndash; the 100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers and the Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers. These changes are subject to EU State Aid approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700070#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Funding","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700070#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[45901\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700070#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding Kerry Social Farming; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>My Department established a &euro;1m fund for Rural Development and Innovation projects\u00a0in 2015, under the remit of my colleague Minister Phelan.<\/p><p>The purpose of this &euro;1m fund is to address some of the recommendations laid down in the CEDRA report,\u00a0and was utilised for a variety of pilot initiatives in 2015, including:<\/p><p><b>- Support for Female Rural Entrepreneurs <\/b><\/p><p>This was a national but targeted programme to select up to 50 women who have recently started or who have taken the first steps towards starting their own business in rural areas.<\/p><p><b>- Support for Social Farming Operations <\/b><\/p><p>This was a grant- aid programme to help advance existing social farming operations<\/p><p><b>- Support for Community Based Food and Artisan Markets <\/b><\/p><p>This was a scheme designed to help support activity in rural high streets through support for community based local food and artisan markets<\/p><p><b>- Agri-food related Tourism Initiatives<\/b><\/p><p>This was a scheme to provide for agri-food and marine tourism projects which advance rural and coastal economic development and was operated through the Local Authorities.<\/p><p>This Rural Development and Innovation fund has been increased to &euro;1.5m for 2016 and work is ongoing to develop how this funding will be allocated.\u00a0 As before, it will be utilised to address the recommendations in the CEDRA report, and is likely to contain a support specifically on Social Farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700070#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700070#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[45920\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700070#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will prioritise the provision of additional staffing to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to facilitate the use of additional sea-fisheries infrastructure that is currently not designated for use due to a lack of coverage by the authority; if the use of a pier (details supplied) in County Kerry could be facilitated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>I received this request some time ago and consulted the SFPA in relation to the request for the designation of Renard Pier, Co.

If my Department were to permit deforestation, it would fall to the State&rsquo;s afforestation programme to fund the replacement of those areas deforested by grant-aiding other individuals to plant a similar number of hectares elsewhere.  In effect, this is analogous to the State indirectly subsidising commercial developments through its afforestation programme.

As the Deputy is aware, price is ultimately a matter to be determined between both the purchasers and the sellers of cattle. Cattle prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by seasonality of production, length of the production lifecycle, market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats as well as the overall macroeconomic situation. My Departmental officials and I are constantly conscious of the need to develop new market outlets for quality Irish beef and live cattle. I have just returned from a trade mission where I discussed market access with my counterparts in Nigeria and Ghana, and this week access has been secured to the Maldives for beef exports, making it the fifth nee market this year for Irish beef.<\/p>  <p>  2015 has been a relatively positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average to date up 8% on last year. With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents. These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market. However, one should note that sharp currency fluctuations have been one of the major factors in price divergence this year. Live exports of Irish beef cattle to Northern Ireland are up this year in both absolute terms and relative to cattle of dairy dams.  At the end of October, 28,500 beef cattle had been exported across the border compared to 18,600 in the same period in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The best interests of this very important industry are ultimately served by ensuring a continuing supply of high quality cattle to the processing sector, and, subject to market context, this objective can be best achieved by providing a fair level of remuneration to suppliers for their efforts. I would also encourage processors to ensure that their systems for determining price are as open and transparent as possible to the farmer and that any adjustments or changes regarding specification criteria are clearly and promptly   communicated and have regard to the realities of the production cycle. <\/p>  <p>  In 2014 there were 1,647,827 carcasses of adult bovines classified by mechanical (94.4%) or manual (5.6%) methods. There were 515 classification control inspections conducted by Classification officers during 2014 in 31 factories and local authority abattoirs. During these unannounced inspections 51,017 carcasses were checked by Classification officers for conformation and fat. DAFM Classification officers also checked weights, dressing (Trim) and labelling. In the first 11 months of 2015 50,782 carcasses were inspected during 520 unannounced inspections. At these inspections, DAFM officers also conducted all the ancillary checks outlined above. There are currently five officers authorised to supervise classification checks. While I am satisfied that my Department operates a robust and comprehensive carcass classification control regime, I am also aware of the need to continuously monitor the way in which controls are undertaken, including the feasibility of reconfiguring existing Department resources within meat factories. I can assure the Deputy that this process of analysis and review is ongoing, and that I will make any necessary adjustments to ensure the continued good functioning of the control regime. <\/p>  <p>  The outlook suggests that 2016 may be a challenging year for the sector. However, with careful and considered monitoring of market trends, open channels of intra-sector communication and engagement, access to new export market for beef and live cattle and a continued focus on highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality, grass-fed beef system, I believe the industry can overcome these challenges and continue to justify the large vote of confidence that this government has placed in the beef sector. <\/p>  <p>  Yesterday I chaired the seventh meeting of the Beef Roundtable. The meeting discussed proposals to recognise Producer Organisations in the Beef Sector, which will give formal recognition to POs for the first time in Ireland, as well as an update on beef markets and upcoming initiatives in animal health. As always the meeting also reviewed the implementation of the Agreement from last November&rsquo;s Roundtable. The producer organisations have been one of the key outcomes of last November&rsquo;s roundtable agreement and marks an historic breakthrough for Irish beef farmers who now for the first time will have a legal framework allowing for negotiation directly with factories on price as a group. As we have seen from other sectors, POs can greatly help to rebalance the supply chain by strengthening the hand of producers who will now have a structure for negotiating collectively. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700073#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":816,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700073#WRS01550"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[46393\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700073#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":818,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2015 Basic Payment\/Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme application on 29 May 2015.

In the case of severe weather events, these meetings are chaired by senior officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as the lead Department and I have been personally briefed by the Chair   of the NECG during the recent severe weather. When such NECG meetings are convened, representatives on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning attend the first meeting and attendance at subsequent meetings is at the discretion of the Lead Government Department, who may also call in additional expertise when required. <\/p>  <p>  Senior officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have continued to chair the meetings of the NECG on Severe Weather in response to Storm Desmond and the associated flooding impacts, which have been held almost daily since the first meeting on 3 December 2015 to date. The NECG on Severe Weather is continuing to regularly brief the Government, Ministers and the relevant Departments and Agencies on the national responses to these impacts. The NECG has also held daily briefings with the media to inform the public of the evolving situation and the whole of Government response to it. It is envisaged that these meetings will continue this week depending on the evolving nature of the flooding situation being experienced and any further impacts the weather may have.   <\/p>  <p>  Separate to this severe weather response, I chair the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which includes senior officials of Government Departments, senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces and officials of other key public authorities, which have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning. <\/p>  <p>  The Government Task Force coordinates and oversees the emergency management policy and activities of all Government Departments and public agencies. It provides political leadership and facilitates coordination of emergency management between Government Departments\/agencies on an ongoing basis and is supported by the Office of Emergency Planning within the Department of Defence. The Government Task Force meets on a regular basis throughout the year and the next meeting is planned to take place in early January 2016 given the fact that the National Emergency Coordination Group on Severe Weather has been meeting almost daily since 3 December 2015.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the previous meetings of the Government Task Force, there have been a total of five meetings held in 2015. I chaired the first meeting on 26 February 2015 and the last meeting held on 12 November 2015, which was followed by the launch of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Be Winter Ready&rdquo; Information Campaign. The other three meetings were held on 30 April 2015, 23 July 2015 and 8 October 2015 and were chaired by senior officials of the Department of Defence. While details of matters discussed at meetings of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning are confidential, I can confirm that the Task Force continues to examine current risks and supports the coordination arrangements for emergency planning across a &ldquo;Whole of Government&rdquo; approach. The Government Task Force is also regularly briefed on matters such as the current security threat, which is provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, as well as receiving regular updates and briefings on topical matters from the relevant lead Government Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700074#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":844,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700074#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":845,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[45817\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700074#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the up-to-date figures for the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, by each of the three services, by rank and by gender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":846,"content":"<p>The following tables set out the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as of 31 October, 2015, the latest date for which figures are available, across all three services and ranks, broken down by gender.

The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>There have been 5 appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011.  Commandant Adam Lagun was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011.  This position became vacant in October 2014 due to Commandant Lagun being deployed overseas.  On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff, the temporary appointment of Commandant Syed Shah to the Board, from 16 October 2014 to 31 May 2015, was made to cover Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s absence. Commandant Lagun resumed as Ordinary member of the Board in June 2015.  The position became vacant again in September 2015 with the deployment overseas of Commandant Lagun.  On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff Commandant Zdenek Osecky was appointed temporarily to cover this temporary vacant position, from 10 September 2015 to 30June 2016.<\/p><p>As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, the positions outlined above were not publicly advertised on either occasion.  Details of these appointments to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.<\/p><p>A civilian doctor, Dr. Loretta Nolan, was appointed as ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board in November 2013.  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.  A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.<\/p><p>The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished.  Against this backdrop, in July 2011, the then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure. In this context, none of the positions were advertised, nor was the chairperson interviewed by an Oireachtas committee.  Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence.  The membership of the interim Board appointed in July 2011 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Name <\/th><th>Nominating Bodies <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Chairperson <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Brian Spain, Director, Department of Defence <\/td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Members<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Cathal Duffy, Principal, Department of Defence <\/td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ms. Clare Tiernan, Principal, Department of Defence <\/td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Robert Mooney, Principal, Department of Defence <\/td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Bill Smith, Director General, Civil Defence Board <\/td><td>Appointed as Director General, Civil Defence Board <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Ned Gleeson, County Manager, Limerick City Council <\/td><td>Nominated by County and City Managers&rsquo; Association <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Keith Leonard, Assistant Fire Advisor <\/td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dr. Barbara Rafferty <\/td><td>Nominated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Becci Cantrell <\/td><td>Nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ms. Veronica Forde, Assistant Civil Defence Officer <\/td><td>Nominated by the Civil Defence Officers&rsquo; Association <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lt.

The figure of 4,000 includes approximately 2,600 persons to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU programme and 520 programme refugees from camps in Lebanon and Jordan, which the Irish Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2016 under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement programme.

This will include the curricular arrangements for the provision of clinical legal education and the methods by which, and the persons by whom, such education and training is provided.  I have also ensured that the Bill includes, at Section 34(1), for a public consultation specifically in relation to this matter.  The Authority's report to the Minister of that consultation must be provided within two years of the Authority's establishment.  It will contain a review of the existing arrangements and will make such recommendations as it considers appropriate in relation to any necessary reforms.  The outcome of these deliberations, as expressly enabled under the Bill, will inform policy in relation to legal professional education and in relation to how it may impact on access to the legal professions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Bill's provisions on access to barristers, the Bill does in fact provide for direct access by clients to barristers in relation to non-contentious business under Section 101.  This is an important first step in ensuring that consumers who wish to directly access legal opinion do not necessarily have to do so through a solicitor intermediary.  At the same time, the Bill provides that direct access to barristers may in the future also be provided in relation to contentious matters, that is to say contested or disputed matters such as those coming before a court or tribunal.  This will be subject to the public consultation process set out in Section 120(1) of the Bill alongside the related consultation on the question of barristers holding clients' monies.  The results of these consultations, scheduled within 12 months of the establishment of the Authority, will inform the necessary next steps to be taken.  In this way the Bill provides a framework within which a degree of direct access to barristers can immediately be enjoyed by prospective clients for non-contentious business.  At the same time, the Bill also seeks to ensure, for the future, that any necessary protections of the interests and monies of clients which may arise in the conduct of contentious business by a barrister on the basis of direct access by a client can be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments Review","counter":921,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV00650"},{"type":"question","counter":922,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[45776\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the recommendations of the Denham report on judicial appointments and her plans to end the political appointment of judges.

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose. <\/p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June.  To date, 306 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases.  Letters will continue to issue to all complainants, until the process is completed which I expect will be very shortly as we are nearing the end of the process.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  I know that some Deputies have argued that the review should have involved interviews with the complainants and other relevant persons, but with respect I think that is to misunderstand this process.  To have required counsel to hold hearings where they would interview everyone concerned would in effect have been to hold full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical. <\/p>  <p>  I wish also to stress the independence of this process.  The cases have all been considered by independent barristers, members of the Panel constituted to conduct this review.  Following their reviews of the papers in each complaint, counsel made recommendation to me, as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  I also decided to appoint a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of letters notifying individuals as to the outcome of the review in their particular cases.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.   I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish. <\/p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However, I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.  One of the main reasons for this has been because a case has already been through due process even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated before, I will make a comprehensive statement on all matters relating to the process once it is completed, including an overview of the outcomes of cases.  I have also asked counsel to produce a general overview report on the issues and trends which featured in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":936,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV01650"},{"type":"question","counter":937,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[45884\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total number of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na employed, how this compares with previous levels, what she considers the ideal required number; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":938,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 31 October 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available there were 12,866 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. It is expected that a further 395 will attest by the end of 2016 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  I expect recruitment to continue at or around the current levels for the next number of years having regard to factors such as the level of retirements in any one year.

The other part, which relates to the pay and conditions of members and appropriate industrial relations mechanisms, is ongoing under the stewardship of Mr Ray McGee, formerly of the Labour Relations Commission.<\/p><p>The report makes some 80 recommendations in relation to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its deployment practices, culture, human resources practices and financial management.  Some of the recommendations are far-reaching and, if implemented, would involve a fundamental restructuring of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the country.  It is, therefore, important that the full implications of the recommendations, and the analysis underpinning them, are considered in detail before any decisions are taken.  With these considerations in mind, I have put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed and have requested them to respond within a reasonably short period of time, having regard to the size and scope of the report. <\/p><p>In relation to the particular matter raised by the Deputy, the report does suggest that there are a significant number of technical or administrative posts occupied by Garda&iacute; that do not appear to require sworn powers, and that may provide good opportunities to increase the use of skilled civilians and release members for front-line roles.  As recognised by the Inspectorate, however, achieving the optimum composition of the Garda workforce as between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff and redeploying Garda members to front-line duties is a medium term project requiring very detailed analysis of the specific roles in An Garda Sioch&aacute;na in order to determine if they require Garda powers and if not, the mix of skills required by a civilian to fill the post instead.  It is not the case that members can simply be redeployed overnight &ndash; it must be done in planned way with suitably qualified civilians recruited to replace them.  In addition, there may be medical reasons arising from injuries received while serving on the front-line or other health reasons that might prevent a member being deployed to the front-line.<\/p><p>In saying that, I am keen that this work should progress as quickly as possible and my Department will continue to work with the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to make progress in this area.  As an example of what can be achieved, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":943,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[45886\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700076#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Reserve can play a greater role in the provision of non-frontline support and administrative work for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":944,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel, including the Garda Reserve, among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

The other part, which relates to the pay and conditions of members and appropriate industrial relations mechanisms, is ongoing under the stewardship of Mr Ray McGee, formerly of the Labour Relations Commission.  I should mention that I have arranged for the report to be sent to Mr McGee in order that he may take it into account in completing his part of the review.<\/p><p>The report will make an important contribution to the on-going reform agenda in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It identifies scope for broad-ranging reforms in relation to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its deployment practices, culture, human resources practices and financial management. Clearly, a report of this nature requires a considered response. Some of the recommendations are far-reaching and, if implemented, would involve a fundamental restructuring of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the country.  It is, therefore, important that the full implications of the recommendations and the analysis underpinning them are considered in detail before any decisions are taken. The Government is determined that whatever action might ultimately be taken in response will not interfere with the closeness of the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the communities it serves. In fact many of the recommendations are aimed at enhancing and developing frontline policing and community supports. With these considerations in mind, I have put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed. I have requested them to respond within a reasonably short period of time, having regard to the size and scope of the report. The report will also be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform in the New Year.<\/p><p>When considering the report it is important to contextualise the recommendations. Many of them arise from historical underfunding of, for example, critical ICT infrastructure which the Government has sought to rectify by providing an additional &euro;205 million over the next number of years. It is also important to keep in mind the excellent work that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do day in and day out to ensure the safety of our citizens throughout the State. Undoubtedly, the report identifies scope for broad-ranging reform but the need for on-going reform is a challenge that all organisations face, a fact acknowledged by the Inspectorate in the report itself.  In this regard I welcome the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s intention to publish a Strategic Transformation Programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shortly. I understand that the Programme will address many of the themes covered by the Inspectorate report and will also be sufficiently flexible to take on board any other agreed reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1038,"content":"<p>Question No. 364 answered with Question No. 338.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Retirements","counter":1039,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1040,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[46236\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; that left the force in each year since 2011.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1041,"content":"<p>I have requested the information sought from the Garda Commissioner regarding the total number of Garda that left the Service in each year since 2011 and I will write directly to the Deputy on receipt of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[46258\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of appointments to State boards under the aegis of her Department and the number of appointments that have been advertised on her Department's website since March 2011; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

people injured and the families bereaved by the many acts of violence, such as the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Henry Barron carried out a detailed independent inquiry into those awful events and other atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  Related matters were also investigated by the McEntee Commission of Investigation.  Arising from the report of the Barron Inquiry and the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights the Garda Commissioner appointed a dedicated liaison officer for the victims of the bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973 and in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.  This dedicated liaison service has been in place since then and it is currently provided by a Garda Superintendent based at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide effective liaison with the victims of crime and their families.  The Garda authorities are strongly aware of the importance of victims in the criminal justice system and will continue to make efforts to ensure their needs are met, particularly in respect of making information available to them.  The Garda authorities are conscious of the need to ensure that the liaison process is operated in order to best address the needs of the individual victims while at the same time ensuring that criminal investigations would not be in any way compromised.<\/p>  <p>  In achieving this and in the interests of operational effectiveness, Garda liaison with the victims of serious crime and their families is provided directly to them from the Garda Division and investigation team which is investigating the case at hand.  The Garda&iacute; in the Division which is investigating a case are in possession of the detailed and up-to-date information with regard to it and are, therefore, best placed to interact with the victims and their families.  Such interaction is done directly by or under the supervision of the relevant Garda Superintendent.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must always be conscious that the victims of crime are individuals with individual needs and that any approach must take into account their specific requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":1060,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1061,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[46375\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700079#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will address further concerns on the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1062,"content":"<p>The particular case to which the Deputy refers is amongst those considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.

For the 2015-16 programme year, children who were born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 were eligible. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 it was announced that, from September 2016, children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they turn age 3, and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June).  As part of the reform of free pre-school, children will be able to enrol in free pre-school at three different points in the year - September, January and April - so that they can access free pre-school as soon as possible after they reach age 3.<\/p>  <p>  This budgetary measure implements a key recommendation of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy, which recommended that a free part-time place in early childhood care and education be available from every child&rsquo;s third birthday, until they enter primary school.  The Expert Group recognised that this would mean that the period of time a child would spend in free pre-school would vary depending on both the child&rsquo;s birth date and the age at which they start primary school.  The decision to allow children to register for free pre-school at three different points in the year was designed to ensure that children could access the benefits of pre-school as soon as they were old enough.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an upper age limit for participation in free pre-school was set by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment on the advice of the Department of Education and Skills.  Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.  This does mean that different children will spend different lengths of time in free pre-school, but our focus throughout in considering these issues was how to achieve the best outcomes for children.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, the child in question was born in January 2014.  She will be eligible to enrol for the free pre-school in April 2017 and can continue in the programme until June 2019, a total of 88 weeks.  If her parents decide to send her to primary school in September 2018 then she will avail of 50 weeks free pre-school. <\/p>  <p>  Childcare providers will not be required to hold places open in expectation of enrolments in January and April.  I am clear that more capacity will be required and that January and April enrolments may pose a challenge.  Officials in my Department are committed to assisting with these challenges.  They are already working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations on a range of measures which will assist pre-school providers meet increased demand for free pre-school provision, particularly from January and April 2017.  Further information on these measures will be available shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Fees","counter":1092,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1093,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[45754\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount his Department has received in fees from freedom of information requests in 2014 and in 2015 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1094,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Initial Application Fees<\/td><td>&euro;360<\/td><td>&euro;0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Search and Retrieval Fees<\/td><td>&euro;70<\/td><td>&euro;0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total Fees<\/b><\/td><td><b>&euro;430<\/b><\/td><td><b>&euro;0.00<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Under the Freedom of Information Act 2014, since 15 October, 2014 no initial application fee is payable in respect of Freedom of Information requests and if the time spent on the search and retrieval of records in relation to a request is under five hours, no fees are charged in respect of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":1095,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1096,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[45778\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the targets he is working towards for reducing child poverty and the specific steps he is taking to achieve these targets","asker":"1203","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1097,"content":"<p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020,<\/i>was published and launched by Government in 2014.  It provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.  This is a whole of government framework, implementation of which is overseen by my Department.<\/p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>set out a target of lifting over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>- economic security and opportunity.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  Its work is also informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.  The Department of Social Protection have identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in 2015 and 2016 under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures structures.<\/p><p>To assist in this, the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Future,<\/i>which brings together key members of the community and voluntary sectors who work with and for children and young people, and the Department of Social Protection have co-convened a subgroup with officials from my Department and other relevant Departments to progress solutions to the issue of child poverty.  This group has held two meetings in September and November 2015, and two more are planned for the near future.<\/p><p>Although the level of consistent poverty among children has fallen slightly from 11.7% to 11.2% between 2013 and 2014, the Government acknowledges the challenge in successfully achieving the child poverty target, but remains committed to meeting it.  The timescale for achieving the target will be influenced by the pace of economic and employment growth.  However, we believe having an ambitious target and actively monitoring this will provide a roadmap towards which we can develop and implement a strong multi-dimensional policy response.<\/p><p>As part of this multi-dimensional approach and the importance accorded to the development of effective and quality focused services and support for children and young people, my Department in collaboration with the DSP will hold an EU Peer Review in February 2016 to explore innovative responses in prevention and early intervention policy and provision to address child poverty and disadvantage.  This event will involve ten Member States and the European Commission. <\/p><p>My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection supporting this mutli-dimensional approach to child poverty.  There are also a number of areas of focus that support our response to child poverty within my Department.  My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children.  A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes.  In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group was focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  This report was published in July 2015 and informed the estimates process for Budget 2016.  Budget 2016 provides for an additional &euro;85 million investment in 2016.<\/p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme aims to improve the outcomes for children, young people and existing service by drawing on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  It is overseen by an inter-departmental project team.<\/p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  The purpose of recently published <i>National Youth Strategy 2015 - 2020<\/i>is to enable all young people aged 10 to 24 to realise their maximum potential with regard to the five national outcomes in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.<\/i>It is a universal strategy for all young people.  It has a particular focus on the needs of young people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes. <\/p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency is also responsible for the delivery of a range of services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families which are key to supporting outcomes which assist in actively mitigating the impact of child poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Staff","counter":1098,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1099,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[45781\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of political staff working in his Department, including the role and salary of each staff member.

Work will also begin on the development of Quality Standards for After-School Childcare, along with a consultation with children on their views about after-school childcare.  These new developments add to the range of programmes implemented by my Department to assist parents in accessing quality and affordable after-school childcare. These include:<\/p>  <p>  - The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school.  The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.<\/p>  <p>  - The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.  The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks. Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  - The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p>  - The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","counter":1113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1114,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[46222\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700081#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on the urgency of commissioning a second sexual abuse and violence in Ireland report, into sexual abuse incidences, given than the previous report was 13 years ago and given the need to accurately target resources based on properly researched data","asker":"1195","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1115,"content":"<p>The Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland Study (SAVI 1) was published in 2002 following telephone research in which over 3,000 adults were surveyed.

Given the legislative framework utilised to manage the interaction between the Child Care Act 1991 and the Health Act 2007, in relation to special care provisions, Regulations to be made by the Minister for Health under the Health Act 2007 are required in advance of the commencement of these sections.  These Regulations have now been finalised.  I hope to sign a Commencement Order for the relevant sections of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011, and arrange for the Regulations to be signed by my colleague the Minister for Health, in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law on 10th December 2015.  The main body of provision relates to aftercare but it also includes provision in relation to early years services and technical amendments on foot of the commencement of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  I hope to commence this Act in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  The Children (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law on 27 July 2015.  This legislation amends certain provisions of the Children Act 2001 on the operation of the children detention schools.  I signed the first commencement order under the 2015 Act on 27 November 2015 which brought a number of technical provisions of the Act relating to the children detention schools into force from 1 December 2015.  These provisions are listed in the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2015, Statutory Instrument Number 539 of 2015.  The remaining sections yet to be commenced relate to the ending of the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, the introduction of a new system of remission in the children detention schools and a technical issue relating to the operation of the Children Court on the issuing of detention orders under the Children Act 2001.  In relation to the first of these issues, the relevant sections are to be commenced early in 2016 on foot of the completion of the current programme of recruitment for care staff to work in the children detention schools.  The sections on remission and issuing of detention orders will also be commenced early in 2016 on foot of the completion of policy work for the required secondary legislation in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 was enacted on the 19 Nov 2015. The Act is for the purpose of making further and better provision for the care and protection of children including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for reporting and management of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children.  The Sections that have commenced are 1 to 5 and 28, effective from 11 Dec 2015.  The Sections not commenced are: Section 6-7 (Part I General and Preliminary), Section 8-13 (Part 2 Child Safeguarding Statements), Section 14-19 (Part 3 Reporting), Sections 20-27 (Part 4 Children First Inter-Departmental Group and Sectoral Implementation Plans).  A significant provision in the legislation is the underpinning on a statutory basis of the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group.  This Group, which will include a representative of all Government Departments, will be required to keep under review, the implementation of this legislation and the Children First Guidance, and to report on an annual basis to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700082#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":1126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700082#WRBB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1127,"qnumday":403,"qnumall":"[46401\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700082#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost of implementing a living wage of &euro;11.50 for all employees directly employed or in agencies funded by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1128,"content":"<p>My Department has not undertaken a specific costing exercise to determine the cost of implementing a living wage of &euro;11.50 for its employees and those employed in its agencies.

These proceeds will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer facilities which support the delivery of core health services must be prioritised within the context of the overall capital envelope available to us.  Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs, priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition consideration must be given to the Government's Reform Plan which sets out commitments relating to property asset use and management.

One of the early outputs of the programme was the development of a new operating model for finance in health.  The HSE has submitted a business case for the new operating model which defines the case for change and scope as well as providing an estimate of the resources required to deliver the new operating model and supporting technology.<\/p><p>The change programme covers a number of different strands and involves business process re-engineering, with a recent focus on the technology aspect of the Reform Programme.

Key activities being worked on across the reform programme include developing a stabilisation approach for legacy finance systems and a business intelligence (BI) solution for identifying and agreeing one national reporting finance system for the HSE.  Permission has recently been received from the OGCIO to proceed with the first phase of the stabilisation project and the Finance Reform Board has recently given the go ahead for a Finance BI solution.  Significant progress has also been made in developing and finalising the approach for the procurement of the key components of an IFMS.  The Office of Government Procurement has requested that the procurement of Lot 1 IFMS (Enterprise Resource Planning Platform) should commence as soon as possible subject to the appropriate approvals.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the Health Service Executive as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, and has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  The key objective of this programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to, or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  In 2014, an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m (equating to &euro;6m in a full year) has been allocated to the programme this year to support its ongoing implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the programme is expected before the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information he has requested.

In this context, I must advise you that the Health Service Executive is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets.  These proceeds will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer, facilities which support the delivery of core health services must be prioritised within the context of the overall capital envelope available to us.  Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs, priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, consideration must be given to the Government's Reform Plan which sets out commitments relating to property asset use and management.  These commitments include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.  The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process.  This plan aims to improve the planning and management of the public service property portfolio by improving co-ordination of strategies and activities, processes for strategic planning, projects and property management, standards for accommodation fit-out and data capture, accountability for decision making and deployment of resources. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been requested to reply directly to you as regards its plans for the property in question.

This service is developing in line with best practice and the national clinical programme for acute coronary care. <\/p>  <p>  The cath lab in UHW performs approximately 40 invasive cardiovascular procedures each week and offers a comprehensive range of invasive and non-invasive diagnostic services. This includes the insertion of stents, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.<\/p>  <p>  Primary PCI is undertaken with STEMI heart attacks which are about 20% of all heart attacks. It is done in a cath lab by an experienced cardiologist. The cath lab in UHW is open five days a week from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Patients who require Primary PCI outside these hours are transferred to Cork University Hospital or to a Dublin hospital. However it is important to note that 24 hour, 7 day a week consultant medical cover for cardiac patients is provided in UHW.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that UHW is committed to the progressive extension of the current PPCI service. However, the reality is that any extension to the service will require significant investment, both capital and revenue. 24 hour emergency PPCI cover requires, as a minimum, two cath labs on site. It also requires a minimum of 6 interventional cardiologists. As for any complex acute hospital service, a key criterion for deciding whether a 24 hour PPCI service should be provided, is whether there is sufficient volume of appropriate patient activity to ensure the safe provision of the service. Without sufficient volume of service, staff will not be in a position to maintain their skills and in those circumstances, it will not be possible to provide a safe service.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for new developments is limited and it is of critical importance that the available funds are targeted appropriately. UHW is a constituent hospital of the South South West Hospital Group. The priority to be afforded to the expansion of the PPCI service in Waterford must first be considered from a hospital group perspective and in relation to the planning for the cardiology needs of the Group population.  The development must then be considered in a national context, and in the light of competing demands for scarce resources.<\/p>  <p>  This proposal remains to be considered and prioritised by the HSE.

The HSE is committed to providing services in a more individualised and person-centred way to people availing of day services including school-leavers and those graduating from Rehabilitative (Lifeskills) training, whose service should in future take the form of individualised and personally chosen outcome-focused supports.<\/p>  <p>  Each Local Health Office area in the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a dedicated Disability Manager to coordinate the delivery of services to people with disabilities.

Embassy officials have met with the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture to promote the joint response by the Government and international community to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a long-standing engagement with Ethiopia, one of our seven Key Partner Countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This year alone, we have increased our bilateral programme in Ethiopia to nearly &euro;28 million to address poverty, vulnerability and the impact of the current humanitarian crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Through our bilateral programme in 2015, we have provided &euro;10.4 million to the Productive Safety Net Programme, as well as &euro;3.8 million to the Humanitarian Response Fund managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to address immediate humanitarian needs.

Meetings such as those between the Taoiseach, President Obama and other senior political figures around St Patrick&rsquo;s Day have provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in relation to the undocumented Irish and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.<\/p>  <p>  In July, the Taoiseach and I met with John Boehner, the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a number of his Congressional colleagues when they visited Dublin. More recently, in Washington at the end of September, I met key Democratic and Republican contacts on Capitol Hill, including Senator Patrick Leahy, Congressmen Joseph Kennedy III, Paul Ryan, James Sensenbrenner, Richard Neal and other members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland group. In all of these meetings I stressed the importance we attach to immigration reform, as I did when meeting leaders of the Irish American community later that week in New York.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government is aware of and has raised the matter of waivers of three and ten-year travel bans imposed by the US authorities on Irish undocumented who have overstayed their visa in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  At my request, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to the US Ambassador earlier this year to ask him to explore the question of such waivers further. I have also had the opportunity to directly discuss the matter with the US Ambassador. The Taoiseach also raised waivers, amongst other immigration reform issues, during his visit to Washington for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Government&rsquo;s representations the US Embassy has pointed out that the US waiver system operates uniformly worldwide and is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations.

We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.<\/p><p>On 20 July 2015, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopted the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019. The Action Plan forms part of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy which was adopted by the FAC in June 2012.  Its purpose is to improve the effectiveness and consistency of the EU&rsquo;s policy and commits the EU to promoting human rights in all areas of its external action. Responsibility for the implementation of the Action Plan is shared between the EEAS, European Commission and EU Member States. <\/p><p>Within the EU, Ireland pressed for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief to be included in the Action Plan, and this is now reflected as a stand-alone point with the following actions:<\/p><p>a. Ensure that freedom of religion or belief remains high on the agenda of relations with third countries, as well as in multilateral fora, in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders; promote the exchange of best practices, and deepen awareness on the various components of freedom of religion or belief at Headquarters, EU delegations and Member State embassies.<\/p><p>b. Encourage and support relevant partner countries and other stakeholders&rsquo; initiatives on freedom of religion or belief in particular those aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities, enabling them to manifest their religion or belief without fear of violence, discrimination, political pressure, censorship or persecution.<\/p><p>c. Promote inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue and the role of religious and other leaders in ensuring freedom of religion or belief.<\/p><p>The Action Plan will strengthen the EU&rsquo;s co-ordinated response to persecution based on religion or belief throughout the world. <\/p><p>Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p><p>Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is a member until the end of this month. Ireland reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief during a UN Security Council debate on the victims of attacks and abuses on ethnic or religious grounds in the Middle East, on 27 March 2015.  I personally highlighted the alarming rise in attacks on Christians when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 1 October 2015 and the UN Human Rights Council at its 28th session on 4 March 2015.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and May 2015.  <\/p><p>The issue of freedom of religion was raised by the EU at the most recent EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in Beijing on 30 November 2015.<\/p><p>On 22 October at the Third Committee at the United Nations General Assembly Ireland presented a statement specifically addressing the importance of freedom of religion or belief at an Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Professor Heiner Bielefeldt. The statement can be found on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the following address: <\/p><p>Ireland was also active in the negotiation of the EU led draft resolution on Freedom of Religion or Belief in the Third Committee.<\/p><p>Ireland will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.

They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls, and a direct threat to education and education facilities. Ireland is providing direct support of nearly &euro;1.4 million this year to address the humanitarian needs of those affected by Boko Haram terrorism, including Nigerian refugees in Northern Cameroon. Along with our EU and UN partners, Ireland has commended the operationalisation of a Multinational Joint Taskforce involving troops from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin.  This Taskforce aims to protect innocent people and to prevent the further spread of Boko Haram terrorism.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700091#WRLL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North South Ministerial Council","counter":1487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700091#WRLL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1488,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[46205\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700091#WRLL03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the issues discussed at the recent North-South Ministerial Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1489,"content":"<p>A meeting of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in plenary format was held in Armagh on Friday 11 December 2015.

Not all of the allowances listed are available to every teacher as entitlement is based on the qualifications held by the individual and\/or the nature of the post for which they were employed. <\/p><p>Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure.  The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale. <\/p><p>Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p><p>These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.<\/p><p>Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.<\/p><p>The process of reducing the public service pay reductions made in recent years in respect of teachers and other cadres of public servants is outlined in the relevant provisions of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement and implemented as part of FEMPI 2015, will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p><p>We look forward to seeing the further restoration of public service pay levels as our economy continues to recover strongly. <\/p><p><b>TEACHERS' COMMON BASIC SCALE<\/b><table><tr><th>Scale Point<\/th><th>Pre - 1 January 2011 New entrants<\/th><th>Pre-1 January 2011 New entrants - with effect from 1\/1\/16(Note a)<\/th><th>Post-1\/1\/11 New entrants to teaching - Applied 1\/1\/11 to 30\/6\/13 (Note b)<\/th><th>Post-1\/1\/11 New entrants to teaching - 1\/7\/13 to 31\/10\/13 (Note c)<\/th><th>Post 1\/1\/11 New entrants to teaching - 1\/11\/13 to 31\/12\/15 (Note d)<\/th><th>Post-1\/1\/11 New entrants to teaching between 1\/1\/2011 and 31\/1\/2012 - with effect from 1\/1\/16(Note e)<\/th><th>Post 1\/2\/12 New entrants to teaching - 1\/2\/12 to 30\/6\/13  (Note f)<\/th><th>Post 1\/2\/12 New entrants to teaching - 1\/7\/13 to 31\/12\/15(Note g)<\/th><th>Post 1\/2\/12 New entrants and future entrants - with effect from 1\/1\/16<br \/><br \/>(Note h)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>&euro;

In the primary sector, this can be done by either completing Probation or Droichead.

All providers of ITE must meet these requirements in order for their programmes to be accredited by the Council.  In relation to the appropriateness of the education provided to student teachers in this area, I am advised that all programmes of ITE have been reconceptualised to meet the Council's criteria and each has been reviewed, for professional accreditation purposes, by an independent expert panel. As Inclusion is one of the strategic priorities identified by Council, this area received considerable attention during the review process, and many reports contained commendations or recommendations relating to same.

The latter document makes clear that teachers' learning takes place throughout their careers, not just during one particular phase. Given the complexity of the issues relating to Special Education, and the constantly evolving insights into the best approaches arising from ongoing research in the area, it must be noted that the forthcoming framework for teachers' learning from the Council, Cos&aacute;n, is seeking to develop the national policy framework further. It will recognise that the Continuum offers the best reassurance we can rely on as to the appropriateness of the many ways in which teachers are already seeking to learn about the needs of some of the most vulnerable learners in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700095#WRPP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":1647,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700095#WRPP02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1648,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[46252\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700095#WRPP02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of appointments to State boards under the aegis of her Department and the number of appointments that have been advertised on her Department's website since March 2011; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level. However, it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed. Simply lifting the moratorium as extra funding becomes available in future years is not the best way of improving how school leadership is distributed in our schools. School leaders have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and student outcomes. Leading on curricular change and change management are key challenges for every school leader. The challenge for schools and the Department is therefore to build a leadership partnership that is fit for 21st century Ireland and school context.<\/p><p>Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. <\/p><p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed. Earlier this month, I formally launched the newly established Centre for School Leadership (CSL). The Centre's responsibilities will cover the continuum of professional development for school leaders, from pre-appointment training and induction of newly appointed principals, to continuing professional development throughout careers. The Centre is operating on a partnership basis between the Department of Education and Skills, the Irish Primary Principals' Network (IPPN) and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD). The partnership will have many benefits for the profession in terms of the quality of training programmes, coordination of provision, and increased accessibility.<\/p><p>  As part of the 2,260 additional teaching posts announced in Budget 2016, 250 of these posts are being provided to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed up from teaching time and be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. Up to now only schools with at least with over 500 students received an allocation to free up the Deputy Principal.

As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system enables more effective and community-focused decision making. There is also a more appropriate assignment of reserved functions, full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding savings, it is important to recognise that 2015 is the first full year of the operation of the new structures. I initiated an operational review earlier this year in relation to the new arrangements to assess how they are impacting in relation to both non-financial and financial matters. In this regard, it is important to view the benefits not only in terms of expenditure reductions but also having regard to the broader objectives of local government reform such as strengthening the sector and seeking greater efficiency and more productive use of resources previously taken up with multiple corporate processes.   <\/p>  <p>  The operational review involves an Advisory Group, on which both elected members and local authority chief executives are represented, together with a Local Government Forum for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government. To date, these groups have met on six occasions in total and the feedback thus far from these deliberations suggests that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully. Importantly, there has also been an acknowledgement that there would be no return to the structures in place prior to June 2014, a view which corresponds with my stated position that the re-introduction of the pre-reform configuration of town councils would not be the correct approach.  Accordingly, costings of any restoration of such structures are not being undertaken. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700099#WRTT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":1774,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700099#WRTT00713"},{"type":"question","counter":1775,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[46092\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700099#WRTT00725","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the cost of establishing a directly elected mayor for Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

New revenue from domestic charges underpins the access to commercial borrowing for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  Thirdly, charging for water based on usage leads to a reduction in overall demand for water over time with consequential impacts on required capital investment for capacity increases and operational costs;. <\/p>  <p>  If domestic water charges were abolished, Irish Water and the Group Water sector would require additional funding to substitute for the loss of revenue from domestic customers. The estimated additional revenue requirement in 2016 would be &euro;210.5m, allowing for some reduced customer operation costs and working capital loans in the case of Irish Water, but not factoring in the costs, if any, of dismantling any relevant contracts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700099#WRTT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Expenditure","counter":1784,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700099#WRTT01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1785,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[46096\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700099#WRTT01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the operational costs of Irish Water in 2014; the estimated final total operational cost in 2015, broken down by section, that is, wages, administration and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Advisory Council has already been established on a non-statutory basis under the chairmanship of Professor John Fitzgerald, pending enactment of the legislation, and is already undertaking some preliminary assessments.<\/p><p>The preparation of the National Mitigation Plan is statutorily designed to be a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions.

This scheme aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.<\/p>  <p>  The current scheme was advertised for applications early last year. Some 157 applications were received by Pobal. Following competitive assessment, 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. The award process included considerations such as the social and economic benefits, consistency with current policies and long term vision. <\/p>  <p>  IMSA applied successfully for funding under the scheme, and were allocated &euro;175,950 over the 24 month period of the scheme. The aim of the funding is to assist IMSA to increase the network of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in Ireland to over 400, with over 20,000 disadvantaged men participating. The funding is contributing to the employment of the CEO and a Resource Worker, and associated overheads. I understand that IMSA also receive funding through subscriptions, donations, sponsors and other fundraising.     <\/p>  <p>  Funding under the SSNO is specifically for national organisations such as IMSA for core funding. My Department does not provide funding under the SSNO for local or regional branches of national organisations.

In April 2015, I issued social housing targets and provisional funding allocations to all local authorities to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists.

This includes working with approved housing bodies to assist in meeting the needs of those on the social housing waiting list in their administrative areas.  However, I said when I allocated the targets and funding that all local authorities will be expected to kick-start a building programme.  In that regard, I have announced new social housing construction and acquisition projects to the value of approximately &euro;500 million so far this year, including 43 new units for County Westmeath at a cost estimate of almost &euro;7 million.  Details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: and .<\/p><p>Given the timelag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant units, as well as the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, are important parts of social housing delivery this year. In this regard, Westmeath County Council has programmed 20 to 30 new acquisitions this year, while I am providing funding support to the Council to return over 80 vacant social housing units to productive use.  The projects and programmes to deliver new social housing are being advanced strongly by local authorities. <\/p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) units can be delivered in a variety of ways and local authorities are encouraged to explore and use all of these mechanisms, which include units purchased, leased or constructed by approved housing bodies and both multi-unit developments and individual units leased or acquired through rental arrangements directly by local authorities.\u00a0 Units leased by local authorities or approved housing bodies can be for up to 20 years.\u00a0 The accommodation provided is made available to persons on local authority waiting lists, persons with long term housing needs in receipt of rent supplement or persons who are homeless. <\/p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is a social housing support introduced to cater for the accommodation needs of persons who are in receipt of long term rent supplement. Persons normally must be in receipt of continuous rent supplement for a minimum period of 18 months, and be assessed as having a long term housing need. <\/p><p>The targets for Westmeath County Council for the period 2015-2017 are set out in the table above. Together, the RAS and SHCEP Schemes have met the social housing needs of an additional 153 households in Westmeath County Council in 2015, which is well in excess of the original targets set for the local authority.<\/p><p>I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms under these programmes, local authorities will continue to deliver on their social housing targets in line with the Social Housing Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700101#WRVV01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1847,"content":"<p>Question No. 652 answered with Question No. 629.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":1848,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700101#WRVV01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1849,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[46253\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700101#WRVV01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of appointments to State boards under the aegis of his Department and the number advertised on his Department&rsquo;s website since March 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Separate legislation governs refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds apply but only 50% of the rates paid was refundable.<\/p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  This discretion allows elected members to respond to the differing characteristics of local commercial property markets.  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).   <\/p>  <p>  Rates income data are published by local authorities in their Annual Financial Statements. 2013 is the latest year for which audited local authority Annual Financial Statement data are available.<\/p>  <p>  The information requested in respect of the number of vacant properties where commercial rates were due in 2014, the amount of such properties where rates were paid and the amount outstanding, is not available in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700102#WRWW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":1877,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700102#WRWW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1878,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[46334\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700102#WRWW01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will establish a multi-fund cross-departmental green-deal agency responsible for accessing European and private funding sources, in order to finance a new scheme across all tenure types; the estimated cost of establishing such an agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1879,"content":"<p>In November 2014, the Government approved the Social Housing Strategy 2020, which sets out a strategic framework for meeting the State&rsquo;s social housing needs to the end of the decade.  The Strategy includes a commitment to commence work on a financial vehicle, to be known as the Strategic Housing Fund, to raise funding for the social housing sector.  The financial vehicle will be established to facilitate the aggregation of private investment into a fund for subsequent lending as project finance.  It is intended that this funding would be lent on to qualifying Approved Housing Bodies, giving them access to long term finance.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of this new funding model is being progressed under the oversight of a group which has been put in place to develop the financial aspects of the Social Housing Strategy.  This group - the Finance Work Stream - comprises a range of key stakeholders including my Department, the Housing Finance Agency, the National Development Finance Agency and the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The timing of the introduction of the new funding model will be dependent on the outcome of the group&rsquo;s work.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Housing Finance Agency is a State-owned company established in 1982, which provides loan finance to local authorities and voluntary housing bodies for housing and related purposes.  The HFA raises its funds on the domestic and international capital markets in structures and at costs that reflect its customers&rsquo; requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2015, a new initiative jointly backed by the Housing Finance Agency and the European Investment Bank was announced which is expected to support investment in 2,000 social housing units to be developed across Ireland over the next three years.  The &euro;150 million funding from the European Investment Bank will be matched by the HFA to provide &euro;300 million available for lending to support investment by Approved Housing Bodies across the country to upgrade social housing and improve energy efficiency.  By accessing EIB funding the HFA will be able to offer Approved Housing Bodies long-term finance at extremely competitive rates.  This is just one of the methods of housing delivery in the Social Housing Strategy and underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the acute housing need that currently exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700102#WRWW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing for People with Disabilities","counter":1880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700102#WRWW01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1881,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[46339\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700102#WRWW01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the progress in achieving each of the nine strategic aims set out in the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1882,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[46340\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700102#WRWW01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the date on which the implementation planning group for the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016 was established; the number of meetings the group has held; the number of annual progress reports the group has completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These are joint publications by my Department and the Department of Health and set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy.  They were developed as part of a coherent framework, in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change, the Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings and the Value for Money Review of Disability Services, to support people with disabilities within community-based living with maximum independence and choice.<\/p><p>Considerable progress has been made since the Strategy was published.  Implementation of the Strategy is being driven primarily by the Housing Agency.  A dedicated Housing Subgroup chaired by the Housing Agency was established in 2012 to progress implementation and includes representatives from my Department, the HSE, the Department of Health, local authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing and various disability representative organisations.  The Housing Agency sub-group has met on 25 occasions since its establishment.<\/p><p>National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Housing Provision for People with a Disability, a key output under the NHSPWD, have been developed and was adopted for implementation by housing authorities with effect from November 2014.<\/p><p>Implementation of the Congregated Settings Report, led by the HSE, is supported by my Department through the NHSPWD.  My Department is represented on the HSE Working Group and is supporting the ongoing work to progress the transitioning of individuals from congregated settings.

All HDSGs will be up and running in the coming months.  As part of the priority action to ensure equitable access for people with disabilities, each HSDG must prepare a Strategic Plan for each county\/city area  which aims to identify the housing needs of people with a disability, both current and emerging over the next five years, and develop specific local strategies to meet the identified needs.

It is expected that the majority of this 40% target will be met by wind energy. Quantifying the costs and benefits of meeting our renewable energy obligations is a complex task involving the examination of many interrelated variables. This work and the related findings will form the basis of a report that will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a range of other studies have been undertaken in the last number of years to assess the economic cost of integrating increasing amounts of renewable energy into the energy mix. The All-Island Grid Study, published in 2008, assessed the technical feasibility and the relative costs and benefits associated with various scenarios for increased shares of electricity sourced from renewable energy in the all island power system. The scenarios were informed by the resource available, technological readiness of the various generation technologies (including wind) and cost required per generated unit. This study informed the decision to move towards achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in Ireland by 2020. It concluded that - based on assumptions set out in the report - wind energy represented a cost effective source for electricity generation. <\/p>  <p>  It is well known that Ireland is an ideal location for wind energy investment. The abundant wind resource in Ireland means that each unit of installed wind generation capacity generates more units of electricity when compared with other countries and hence needs a lower rate per generated unit of electricity in order to recover the overall costs of the project. The existing feed-in tariff, REFIT, which is funded from the Public Service Obligation levy on consumer bills, is a very cost effective support for onshore wind development. This was the finding of a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  This finding has been underpinned by other published reports and analyses which have examined the effect of renewables on electricity prices. Two major studies have been published on the impact of increased wind generation on the Single Electricity Market in Ireland. One was carried out by the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s (CER) and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation (NIAER) in January 2009 and the other by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and EirGrid in 2011. Both studies found that the market is capable of operating successfully with increasing amounts of wind and that the cost to consumers in Public Service Obligation (PSO) terms tends to be offset by the downward pressure wind puts on energy prices in the wholesale market.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of sustainability; there is little doubt that the use of indigenous renewable generation is a more sustainable long-term approach for energy security and economic competitiveness than importing fossil fuel energy. In 2014, renewable electricity generation in Ireland is estimated by the SEAI to have avoided &euro;250 million worth of fossil fuels imports. <\/p>  <p>  In the circumstances, there are no plans to set up and independent body to commission further economic review of wind energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700103#WRXX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":1939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700103#WRXX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1940,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[46320\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121700103#WRXX02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the cost of placing national grid extensions underground in GRID West, Grid South and the NSIC.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<\/p><p>In July last I published a detailed draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation. That Strategy proposes that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. This will be a specific requirement of the tender and it will be a matter for bidders to select the technology they consider will best deliver the service.<\/p><p>In accordance with EU State Aid Guidelines, my Department must observe a strict policy of technology neutrality in any procurement process and therefore I am not in a position to promise connectivity through any one particular technology platform.
