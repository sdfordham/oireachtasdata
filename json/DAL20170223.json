In the aftermath of Storm Doris, the ESB is working hard to ensure that people have power restored to their homes.  We wish it well in that task.<\/p>  <p>  What I want to deal with briefly is people who, unfortunately, do not have homes.  I am conscious that there have been many announcements and plans to deal with the challenges facing the housing sector.  We gave the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Development, who had the best of intentions and who engaged in a wide-ranging consultative process involving stakeholders - which was fed into by an Oireachtas committee - time and space.  We allowed some time to see if what was envisaged could be implemented.  Considering the abject failure of the previous plan under the same people in Government, it was always going to be about implementation and we wished it well.  It is time that we begin to engage in an honest appraisal of what is being delivered.  Records continue to be set in the context of the number of people who are homeless, the cost of rent and the gamut of factors associated with the housing construction sector and the provision of housing.  On Monday, Focus Ireland showed that last month a child became homeless every five hours.  That is a shameful statistic.  We in this House are obliged to seek to remove whatever obstacles are preventing the implementation of any plans that are envisaged.  On Tuesday, the Taoiseach waxed lyrical about the fact over 8,500 units are under construction at present.<\/p><p>I lost my head trying to point out to him that this was not true.  I do not want to be losing my cool but we have to impart the frustration felt by those who come into my clinic and the clinic of every other Member to the Members in government.  Of those units he referenced, only 1,829 are under construction, the rest are going through various stages of the process and the majority were approved more than two years ago.  A total of 652 units is all that was built last year.  By 2020 the majority of the houses we are talking about will not be built and, at best, the 8,500 units will be built.  Many local authorities did not build any houses last year.<\/p> <p> The Government seems to be obsessed with announcements in the hope that they will bamboozle people with volumes of details so that they will not see what is going on, but we all are quite aware that progress is not being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300003#A00200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487851500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Time, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300004#B00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487851500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>If I could continue, as it is important that we get back to basics regarding this issue because there has been too much deflection in recent weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300004#B00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1487851500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Deputy will get another opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300004#B00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487851500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, in his recent quarterly report said that 1,000 units would be built this year.

The budget in that Department has increased more than the budget in any other Department in order to reflect the seriousness of the crisis.  Today, &euro;32 million will be announced to deal with the repair and leasing scheme and local authorities will work around the country to make sure that more properties are available for those in need of housing.

There are 8,500 social housing units currently being built across the country, with 509 different organisations engaged in different projects delivering those houses.

We have new people coming into the country and families looking for housing.  We accept the seriousness of the situation.

They read this morning with horror that the situation has spun so far out of control that the estimated cost has ballooned from an initial &euro;404 million in 2012 to a mind-boggling figure of more than &euro;1 billion today.  As it stands, Ireland's national children's hospital - if built - will be the most expensive children's hospital to be built anywhere in the world.  This infuriating saga is now a sorry tale of bungles, incompetence and broken promises stretching across two decades.  In that time, we have seen Governments led by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael make big announcements to the Irish people but deliver very little.  Today, 24 years after the idea was first proposed in 1993, the national children's hospital is still a project wrapped in uncertainty and chaos.  However, we should probably expect little else from a Government whose entire approach to health care is based on the fostering of crises, havoc and confusion.  As our health system creaks, the T&aacute;naiste's party has spent the past two weeks gazing at its navel, indulging its obsession with the question of who might be its new leader.<\/p><p>I have a newsflash for the T&aacute;naiste: both Fine Gael and the Government are bereft of leaders.

The truth, however, is that 500 people lying on trolleys daily has become normal under this Government.  We have seen through recent \"RTE Investigates\" programmes the horrifying stories of children as they wait in agony for vital scoliosis surgery.  On 7 March, nurses and hospital support workers will proceed with industrial action because of the stressful and unacceptable working conditions created by this Government.  Through its arrogant treatment of nurses, this Government is again putting the health and welfare of our children at grave risk.  Whether it is Deputy Varadkar or Deputy Coveney or anyone else in the hot seat, ordinary people have no faith in this Government to deliver a fair health service and accessible health care.

A new children's hospital in Finland, which is a comparable jurisdiction, will cost half what our children's hospital is apparently going to cost.

Will it leave it to the Committee of Public Accounts to call authorities to account for spiralling costs and to account for how public moneys are spent?  Everybody understands the need for the children's hospital.  As I said earlier, this debate has run since 1993.  The reality is that decades have passed and there is no hospital.

Two reports that were published recently by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Morgan McKinley show that the gender pay gap in this country is widening.  Interestingly, the figures show that the pay gap between the earnings of men and women has increased dramatically while Fine Gael has been in government.  The gap was 8.3% in 2012, but it increased to a high of 15.2% in 2015.  The cost of child care in this country, which is one of the most expensive in Europe, is one of the factors contributing to this.  It is supposedly planned to deliver a proper child care plan for female workers, 40% of whom are in low-paid, flexible or part-time contracts precisely because of the cost of child care.  The reports I have mentioned show that 3,000 women are being driven out of the workforce each year because of the cost of child care.  Another interesting fact set out in these reports is that in the last year or two, profits in the retail and hospitality sector have soared to over 40% above pre-crash levels.  The workers in this sector are predominantly women.  Equally, it is predominantly women who are on low pay, which is connected to low hours.  It cannot be denied that as women work fewer hours on lower levels of pay, they are driven further and further into poverty and therefore the gender gap widens even further.  There are scientific studies to show that this is the case.<\/p><p>This drives women further into poverty so the gender gap opens in this way.<\/p> <p> I know the T&aacute;naiste is not responsible for all those areas but she is responsible for dealing with the question of equality, and this indicates a large and growing equality gap affecting women in this country.  As well as enduring discrimination in pay, hours and contracts through working life, women who are now retiring are finding their contributory pension is being cut drastically because of banding and averaging of hours.  I know a couple, Paul and Pauline, who are related.  Paul has half the contributions of Pauline but she earns 30% less from her contributory pension.  Both of them have worked all their lives.  The T&aacute;naiste is presiding over inequality as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Therein lies the injustice.<\/p> <p> What will the T&aacute;naiste do about the growing gender equality and pay gap?  What will she do about the visible discrimination against pensioners, which is known to the Department?  When they retire, they are discriminated against on two grounds: age and, mostly, gender.  Women are primarily the homemakers and have been so through the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300007#E01600","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487853600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>The first point is about gender equality.  I saw the details of the report mentioned by the Deputy and they need examination.  There were quite a number of areas where it was highlighted how well Ireland is doing.  In terms of child care, the Government is investing more than has ever been invested in child care.  The Deputy quite rightly states that for women combining work and family life, we need access to high-quality, affordable and accessible child care, and that is what the Government is committed to doing.  We have introduced the second free preschool year and we have also dealt with the very important issue of young children in preschool who need access to special needs services.  For the first time, the Government has ensured those children will have access to special needs supports and assessment, which is very important.  Primarily, this is about increasing the number of affordable places, and that is happening with the second free preschool year.  There are more children than ever - approximately 120,000 - availing of those two free preschool years.  That will be rolled out in September.  There is also the matter of after-school places and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has been doing much work in ensuring more child care is available.  That will help reduce the gap that the Deputy mentions.<\/p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to another survey on income and living conditions, which indicates income inequality decreased last year.

Proper care of diabetes is one of these opportunities.<\/p><p>In Donegal, of 666 adults with type 1 diabetes, only 20 attending Letterkenny University Hospital have access to an insulin pump.  This week, I received a letter from a constituent who, after living with diabetes since he was eight years old, was approved for a pump.  However, Sligo University Hospital is the only place adults from Donegal can have a pump fitted.  Letterkenny University Hospital does not have staff to fit pumps.  My constituent was delighted to get a quick appointment for Sligo hospital and even more when he was told his pump would be fitted before the end of January this year.  Given that he was due to start a new job in Scotland on 1 March, the timing could not have been better.  However, ten days ago he received a call from Sligo telling him the diabetes nurses hours had been cut by 15 hours per week and that they could not now fit his pump.  There are seven insulin pumps in Sligo that will not be fitted and that are gathering dust at a cost of &euro;4,700 each.  In his letter, he said:<\/p><blockquote>I can go to Dublin and have a pump fitted privately, but I won't, and it's not because of the money.  I should not even have to go to Sligo.  These services should be provided here in our local hospitals where they have all our history and the staff know us.

As we know, there are huge inequalities between people living in rural and urban areas.<\/p><p>I watched the debate on television last week about religious denominations in schools and how people in Dublin are having such terrible problems getting children into schools.  Where I live in Aughavas there are 60 children attending the local school.  The school over the road from it in Cloone has a similar number.  If there are no more families in our region in the next while, those schools will be under threat of losing teachers and closing.  In Kiltyclogher in north Leitrim, the rural school is under threat of closing this year. <font color=\"#FF22FF\"><\/font>The issue of inequality that exists in this country is really an issue of ensuring people can live in rural Ireland.  To have people living in rural Ireland, we have to have infrastructure in rural Ireland and a development of jobs and opportunity.  Opportunity can only come if a person is on a platform where they can reach that opportunity.  It is true to say that everyone has access to education and all of these things but for many people living in rural areas across the length and breadth of Ireland, they are not in a position to reach the opportunity that may exist.  It is a huge problem for an awful lot of people in our society.  If we institute laws and different things in this Parliament, we end up doing them but in the vast majority of cases, we see that they only look after the people that live where there are large populations.  <br\/><br\/>The motorway network in Ireland was brought to the attention of many people in this assembly over the past number of weeks by the chambers of commerce in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and various areas.  If one looks at the map of the road network, it does not go near the north west at all.It is similar with the rail network - it blocks out huge areas of the country.  If we are going to invest in the regions and ensure there is opportunity for people living in the regions, we have to make sure we do it everywhere.  We have to invest in places where there are low populations at present.  If we do not do that, there will never be people living in these areas.  <br\/><br\/>We see the same thing in our health services.  At the moment, the health service in the north west is particularly under stress.  I raised the issue here the other day of the CAMHS service in Sligo.  We have a service in place for children and adolescents looking for mental health services but there is no child psychiatrist in place.  The child psychiatrist keeps changing because they keep leaving because nobody wants to come and stay and live in rural areas.  That is the problem we have everywhere in the country.  We have the same situation with our ambulance service.  At the moment the target is supposed to be that the ambulance is at the scene of an incident within 15 minutes.  Where I live, an ambulance would find it hard to be there within 40 minutes.  People are at serious risk of losing their lives because we do not have the infrastructure in place.  The Rural Equality Bill attempts to ensure that whatever laws we pass in this Parliament make sure that people in rural areas get equal access to everything.  It does not mean that people who live in Tallaght will be discommoded.  It means that people who live in Leitrim, Donegal, Mayo, rural parts of County Clare or anywhere else can have a fair and equal service with everyone else in every other part of the country.  Bringing in this Bill will ensure we do that and that we look at the impact of anything being done on rural Ireland.  Will we ensure that rural Ireland is a place that can prosper and where there will be a future for people because at the moment there is no sense of future for many people living in rural areas?  Many of them are young people who are forced to emigrate, if not out of the country, certainly to the larger, more populated areas.  <br\/><br\/>We want to make sure we service everyone in every part of the country.  That includes those who live in rural areas.  I particularly think of older people who live in rural Ireland, many of whom have absolutely no access to public transport.  They have very little access to an adequate health service.  To put that in place, we must ensure that everything we bring through Parliament has the concept of rural equality built into it.  That is what this Bill is about.  I commend it to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300016#O05200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487858400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300017#P00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487858400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300017#P00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487858400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1487858400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300017#P00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487858400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300017#P00600","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487858400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Keeping People in their Homes Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1487858400,"counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300017#P00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1487858400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide that adequate consideration be afforded to the principle of proportionality in the context of proceedings which are directed at the repossession of a mortgaged property in which the mortgagor ordinarily resides, and for that purpose to amend the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill is about keeping people in their homes.  Its purpose is to ensure the correct application of EU law by the Irish courts when dealing with repossession.  Central Bank of Ireland statistics from September 2016 show that of 738,506 mortgage accounts relating to principal dwellings, 79,562 accounts were in arrears, of which 56,350 were in arrears of over 90 days.  The figures also show that 43,543 principal dwelling mortgage accounts were in arrears of over one year while 34,500 had arrears over two years.  On the week before Christmas there were around 25 repossession cases in Kerry, 50 in Tipperary, 85 in Athlone and more in Waterford.  A total of 421 homes were repossessed in the third quarter of 2016 according to the figures from the Central Bank.  All this has created real fears of repossession among those in the most vulnerable situations.  This has the potential to put unprecedented strain on the housing sector.  <\/p><p>The programme for Government of May 2016 states that the Government wants to keep families in their home and avoid repossession in so far as possible and that it will protect the family home and introduce additional long-term solutions for mortgage arrears cases.  The Bill provides a viable solution which is completely consistent with the Government's stated objectives and the desire of the Independent Alliance to address these crises.  There is no current legislation specifically aimed at providing a framework of evidence to be considered by the courts.  In a great many cases, there is no detailed consideration of the debtor or his or her individual circumstances required by EU law.  This has led to a situation whereby there is no existing means in the courts to examine on its merits the essential fairness or unfairness of the repossession order.  This Bill addresses the gap in the law.  While Irish courts give the court registrar a wide discretion, EU law already obliges domestic courts in the EU, including Irish courts, to examine customer contracts, including mortgage contracts before them, of their own motion, for unfair contract terms, although this does not take place in all cases.  While the Irish courts have a discretion in granting, adjourning, varying, postponing, suspending or executing possession orders, EU law already requires consideration of additional matters.  Once EU law becomes applicable in mortgage cases, under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights the Irish courts can consider the proportionality of granting, adjourning, varying, postponing, suspending or executing possession orders.  This proportionality test is based on proposed legislation.  Essentially it means if there is a choice between several appropriate measures to achieve such an objective, rightly pursued by legislation, the courts must adopt the least onerous one and the disadvantage caused must not be unreasonable to the end pursuit.  <\/p><p>Everyone in the House knows from people calling to their constituency office and attending their clinics that there are families, mothers, fathers, and children suffering in the nightmare scenario of losing their home.  The phone calls, the letters and the court appearances are never ending for them.  Many are still working, although not earning as much as they once did, and still are trying to play some part of the mortgage each month.  However, they are still hopelessly falling into arrears.  There appears to be no end to the stress and grief that has engulfed these families.  In many cases there has been gross interference with the right to a quiet and dignified family private life but very little is being said on their behalf because they are embarrassed into silence.  They remain afraid and alone as they dread the prospect of a new letter falling through the letter box each morning, not to mention the trauma and the repetition of the court appearances that take place in unfamiliar surroundings.  In many cases, families are afraid to seek help.  Very often they attend court without legal representation.  They expect a legal system that vindicates their rights.  Sadly in many instances this is not happening.  It is incredible that nine years after the crash we are still talking about mortgage arrears in this House.  The problem remains real and we have been elected by the people to solve the problem.  We must act now.  The mortgage arrears crisis can and must be resolved.  In more recent Irish court judgments, the courts are increasingly turning their attention to the issues I have just raised.  The legacy of the housing price crash remains to bear witness to the silent suffering citizens.

A number of measures in the Bill are to be welcomed.  I went through them so I will not repeat them.  However, in many other respects, if I may put this as baldly as it deserves to be put, the Bill is an insult to people affected by disability.<\/p>  <p>  People have waited unnecessarily for ten years because of the unwillingness of successive Governments, most recently those led by Fine Gael, to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when there was no legal impediment to doing so.  A red herring argument was put forward about the need to get the legislative ducks in a row to effect legislative equality across a range of areas as a prerequisite to ratification.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is and remains a complete red herring, a con job and a ruse to avoid ratification, which was promised but which we are still not getting.  We were supposed to get it by Christmas.  This is a deliberate delaying tactic by Fine Gael.  Tragically, the Minister of State, who has a record on this, is being used as the mudguard to continue these delaying tactics.  In this respect, the Bill is an attempt at a cosmetic glossing over of the continued refusal of the Government to ratify and its delay in doing so.  Fine Gael, probably as well as Fianna F&aacute;il before it, has been worried about what it sees as the cost and political implications that would flow from ratification.  Ratification would result in the relevant UN monitoring body standing over the Government, issuing reports year after year showing how successive Governments have failed and continue to fail people with disabilities, fail to vindicate their rights and fail to establish full legal and social equality for them.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind but that this is the case.  When one considers what has happened to people with disabilities under the impact of austerity, many of the measures taken, far from improving the rights of people with disabilities, substantially worsened their situation.<\/p><p>The Government was well aware that it would have had serious problems implementing those austerity cuts if it had ratified the UN Convention because it would been called out on them and would have been many times over in serious breach of its commitments under the convention.  One can see the list of attacks affecting people with disabilities in recent years: cuts to the motorised transport grants, to the mobility allowance, to medical card entitlements and to millions of hours in home help.  Thankfully the attempt to cut personal assistance services failed but only because of the direct action protest by people with disabilities outside this House which forced the Government to row back on that.  There have been other cuts across a range of services that have affected people with disabilities disproportionately, most obviously the cuts in housing and the lack of adapted social housing, as well as multiple cuts to the health service, public transport and social protection such as the exceptional needs payment, the fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus.  In education there have been caps on special needs assistants, SNAs, and resource hours.  There are cuts in the domiciliary care allowance and so on.  This carries on now.<\/p> <p> The mooted plans to take the staff out of DART stations affect people with disabilities.  This affects the Minister of State's constituency.  He should get on it.  We will have a protest in a couple of weeks' time and we hope there will be protests up and down the DART line about this.  It has very particular pertinence to disability rights and the question of access to public transport, the right to independent living and so on.  Access to the DART is already inadequate.  We had meetings in our area with the representatives of the DART on how to improve accessibility.  The representative gave us commitments and promises to improve the situation.  At the moment one has to give 24 hours' notice which severely limits people's freedom to travel especially if there are any hitches or delays.  Critically, the ability of the DART service to respond to and improve that situation depends on having staff in the stations.  Does the Minister of State know there is a plan to remove staff from DART stations?  How the hell will they improve or even maintain access for people in wheelchairs if they remove staff?  Sandycove-Glasthule and Grand Canal Dock are the first on the hit list.  How will people phone the DART stations?<\/p> <p> One of our suggestions to the DART representative was to have a direct line to the DART station or a text mechanism whereby the person could quickly, and at short notice, notify the DART stations that people with wheelchairs want to use them.  That is not going to work if there are no staff in the DART stations, not to mind all the other health and safety issues or accidents.  It will be bad for a range of people in terms of DART services but it will further degrade and deteriorate the access of people in wheelchairs and with other disabilities to DART stations.  The Minister of State should start ringing the alarm bells that this will not be acceptable. There will be protests.  I urge anybody who is on a DART line to start mobilising their community to ensure staff are not taken out of the DART stations as planned.<\/p> <p> Several public service routes have been degraded in our area and all over the country.  That will disproportionately hit the rights, freedoms, liberties and so on of people with disabilities.  If we ratified the UN convention, we would be called out on such issues.  Questions would be asked about that and a range of other things.  That is why Fine Gael has not ratified it and does not want to ratify it.  It is delaying it.  I have been informed by a lady who is in the Public Gallery that the Government wants derogations on several areas in order that when it does ratify, it can slip out of some of its commitments because it does not want to do what is necessary in terms of resources and legislation to copperfasten the rights in the convention.<\/p> <p> I smell a rat.  The proof of this is to arrive with a half-written Bill.  It is quite extraordinary.  Some of the key areas that have been drawn to my attention include deprivation of liberty, the use of restraint in schools, involuntary sectioning and so on.  We need a great deal of input on these and other issues from people with disabilities and those who advocate on their behalf.  The point of the legislative process, when done properly in several stages, is precisely to have real buy-in from those affected.  If that is true in general, it is all the more true when it comes to disability, and the convention specifies that people with the lived experience of disability must have a key role in the monitoring and preparation of the legislation.  We are doing this the wrong way around, for cynical reasons.  Where is the real consultation on the range of legislative areas that affect people with disabilities?  It is all crammed into a little Committee Stage for last minute half-baked legislation that will be rammed through, instead of time being taken over that legislation with real buy-in, involvement, consultation and it being driven by people with disabilities.  It should be done properly and the ratification should be happening now which would put pressure on the Government to get the legislation right and to be called out on it when it fails to vindicate the rights of people with disabilities and to establish the equality they deserve.<\/p> <p> I am hearing frustration, anger, fury and justified cynicism about what is going on here.  At best this is cosmetic at worst, a con trick being played on people to make it look as if we are doing something, because the truth is the Government was put under pressure before Christmas, and has been for many years, by disability advocacy groups demanding this ratification.  There has been an indefensible ten year delay, yet still there are delaying tactics and this half-baked Bill.  If the Minister of State were on the other side of the House, he would be saying what I am saying now.  He knows what is going on.  It has to be called.  We need the ratification, not more excuses.  The Government should just do it.  Then let us prepare the legislation properly with the involvement and buy-in of, and indeed driven by, people with the lived experience of disability.  Amendments will flow on Committee Stage but this is being done in the wrong way.  We need ratification.  The chorus of voices demanding that will increase when the inadequacy or cynicism of the way this legislation is being dealt with becomes more apparent over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300019#R00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487860500,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The debate on this Bill is extremely important.  The digest that has been produced to accompany this legislation confirms that approximately 600,000 people in this country, or 13% of the population, have a disability.  The exact figure depends on the definition of &quot;disability&quot; that is used.  The figure is much higher if a broader definition is used.  The digest continues:<\/p><blockquote>Of people aged 15 and over with a disability, 21% were at work.  This compares to 50% for the overall population aged 15 and over.<\/blockquote><p>Those figures are damning.  The system is set up to disable people who have a disability all the more.  When we passed the universal declaration in Galway a long time ago - I think it was in 2002, which is 15 years ago - we tried to change the language to facilitate universal design.  The mantra at the time - it was more than a mantra - was &quot;good design enables and bad design disables&quot;.  The exact same point can be made in the context of the Government's failure to introduce legislation to empower people, which is what the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities sets out to achieve.  I do not need to preach to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, because he is fully aware that the UN convention represents a paradigm shift from the medical model to a rights-based approach under the social model.  This involves a move away from regarding people with disabilities as people who require assistance due to their impairments to regarding them as holders of rights who are entitled to social integration under the social model.<\/p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has welcomed the general approach to promotion, protection and monitoring that is signalled in the Bill before the House.  It is a reflection on us and an indictment of the political system that in 2017, well into the 21st century, we are still arguing about what should and should not be contained in legislation of this nature.  Ireland started off on a very good footing in this respect ten years ago when it was one of the first countries to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I want to pay tribute to the various civil groups, including the Centre for Disability Law and Policy in Galway and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, that were instrumental in shaping the language of the convention.  Our record since then has been appalling, however.  While I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and acknowledge his experience in this area, I agree substantially with what my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, has said about this Bill.<\/p><p>There is absolutely no legal impediment preventing the Government from signing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on behalf of Ireland.  I suggest it has been decided as a matter of policy not to sign it.  When we sign it, a greater level of responsibility will be placed on our shoulders to do things we have not done, such as the rolling out of facilities and the championing of the word &quot;equality&quot;.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that we should ratify the convention now.  We signed it ten years ago.  There is absolutely nothing to stop us ratifying it, other than that it would leave us open to exposure before UN committees for our failure to bring in the appropriate legislation.  I am not referring solely to this legislation.  For example, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has yet to be fully enforced.  To a certain extent, we are playing a game here.  There is a certain amount of cur i gc&eacute;ill and hypocrisy i gceist here because we do not wish to be exposed.  I suggest that our exposure as a country would be a small price to pay for the much more important forcing of the situation that would come from ratifying the convention.<\/p><p>Some aspects of this Bill are welcome.  Clearly, it is welcome that deafness will not be a barrier to serving on a jury.  I welcome the removal of archaic language, particularly in respect of people of unsound mind.  I am pleased that the quota that applies to the Garda is being extended to the civilian side.  While there are some positive provisions in the Bill, I have serious concerns about how it is progressing.  My concerns are one thing, but the concerns of the Centre for Disability Law and Policy in Galway, which has substantial experience in this area, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Inclusion Ireland and various other civil groups are much more important.  My voice and the other voices in here are simply speaking on behalf of organisations that have accepted the bona fides of each Government with which they have worked, only to find themselves now looking at a Bill from which significant segments have been omitted.  I refer, for example, to the need to introduce legislation pertaining to the deprivation of liberty.  I am aware from my previous life in the law area of the shocking gap that exists.  We have protections for people with mental illnesses going into psychiatric hospitals, protections for prisoners and - theoretically - protections for children being taken into care.  However, we have absolutely no protections for people with disabilities or older people with Alzheimer's disease going into nursing homes or other institutions.  There is a complete gap in our law in such areas.  We have compounded that by leaving it out of this Bill.  I understand it will be introduced on Committee Stage, along with other sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300021#T00100","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1487860500,"counter":244,"content":"<p>That is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300021#T00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487860500,"counter":245,"content":"<p>The removal of an important part of what we signed up to - maximum communication with people with disabilities - compounds the insult to people with disabilities.  I remind the House that Article 33 of the UN convention enshrines the right of people with disabilities to participate in the decision-making process entirely separately from the organisations that represent them.  Sections of great importance have been omitted from the Bill and will not be discussed until Committee Stage, with all that entails in terms of restricting people's rights.  It is worth noting in this context that the word \"equality\" has been left out of the name of this Bill.  I have no idea how the Minister of State could stand over the omission of the word \"equality\" from a Bill of this nature.  Similarly, we do not know what reservations or derogations the Government intends to seek.  That is extremely important, but it has been completely left out.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is being partly given an independent monitoring role.  It is being given a general monitoring role, but not a specific role in monitoring the implementation of this legislation.  I wonder if we have learned anything from the debacle that followed the publication of the wonderful A Vision for Change document in 2006.  We are still awaiting the promised review of A Vision for Change, which ran out in January 2016.  It was a very positive document that set out just about every possible action that should be taken.  The people who came forward to work with the Government of the day were very sceptical because it is easy to produce a good document.  An essential part of A Vision for Change was the independent monitoring mechanism that sat for two periods of three years.  Those involved did a very good job.  Unfortunately, they had to highlight that the progress being made was slow, tardy and insufficient.  Rather than praising and cherishing the independent monitoring body and giving it more resources, we abolished it.  We learned nothing.  Over a year has passed since A Vision for Change ran out and we are still waiting on the independent review.  If we are serious about monitoring this legislation after it has been passed, it is absolutely vital for us to give the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission the fullest possible role in the independent monitoring mechanism that is being provided for in this Bill.  Concern has been expressed about the decision to make the Department of Justice and Equality the focal point in this context.  Clearly, responsibility in this area should not lie in that Department.  I am open to suggestions on where it should lie.  It has been proposed that it should lie at the heart of the Government in the Department of the Taoiseach.  A similar approach has been taken in the case of the Irish language, although I will not comment on how helpful or efficient that has been.  It was theoretically a very good idea.  We should be going in a similar direction in this case.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which was introduced with great fanfare.<\/p><p>It remains substantially unimplemented, so will the Minister of State comment on it?<\/p> <p> Very specific questions have been asked by civil society but I will not read all of them into the record.  Practically every Deputy has read them, which is testimony to the work on the ground of the various groups that are so concerned about this.  They have not gone on a party political basis but have done their best to educate each and every Deputy in the Chamber.  The Deputies have the questions that have not been answered.  I was watching the Minister of State's reaction intently when the questions were put about what structured communication had taken place, as civil society feels there has not been a structured approach.  The Minister of State shook his head vehemently and I presume he is arguing there has been such a structured approach.  I accept his bona fides but if the organisations on the ground tell each of us that it has not happened, there is a problem somewhere with the understanding of what \"communication\" means.<\/p> <p> There are other questions that we were specifically asked to read out.  I will not read all of them but I will refer to them.  The first, as I noted, related to a formal structured consultation process, which the groups argue has not taken place.  The groups have asked specifically about what reservations or derogations will be sought and the absence of specific legislation relating to the deprivation of liberty.  I have mentioned some of these issues and the groups put them in a question format.  All of those questions should be answered in written form immediately and before this Bill progresses.  These are just practical questions and we must acknowledge work on the ground from people who are challenged every day not just by a disability but by the utter failure of all of us to provide a society that allows them to participate.  We are all responsible for that, although the Government should have the majority of this responsibility.  Similarly, with the recent McCabe issue, specific practical questions were asked that were not answered.  It helps people to come on board if they see questions being answered when they are asked.  I ask that this be done immediately.  It must be important to the groups if they have asked every Deputy to read these questions in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister of State will have listened to all of us and taken on board the serious concerns we have all expressed.  Nobody has played politics with this.  I hope the Government will consider ratifying the convention immediately if we are truly sincere about what we want.  There is no legal obstacle to ratifying it so let us do it.  We can then have a true roadmap for the implementation of the necessary legislation that will allow us to go proudly before a United Nations committee and say that not only have we signed and ratified it but we have done our bit with legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300021#T00300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487861100,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I know there are justifiable complaints about the time the legislation has taken in getting here, I am glad this day has arrived.  To be frank, when Fine Gael came to office, the economy was imploding to such an extent that this issue was not progressed as speedily as was warranted.  It should also be stated that whereas other countries have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we in Ireland are always conscious of having our domestic house in order before we do such things.  There would be little point in ratifying the convention and introducing legislation to rectify errors or gaps afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  At this point I offer words of appreciation to a Galway native and world expert in disability law, Professor Gerard Quinn of the National University of Ireland, Galway.  He was instrumental in the drafting of the disability convention, both as part of an international group of disability non-governmental organisations and as part of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Anybody familiar with the history of the convention will know what an enormous contribution he made.  With regard to the legislation, there are a number of areas that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would like amended or have greater emphasis put upon.  The same applies to various disabilities representative groups.  I know the Minister of State will take due cognisance of these as the Bill goes through the House, as there are other issues not included in the published Bill that will be taken as amendments.<\/p>  <p>  I will clarify one issue.  There has been a discussion about Ireland having obligations under European Union, EU, law because the Union has for the first time signed up to the international human rights treaty.  That is only partially true.  The EU has oversight in terms of existing competencies and this treaty does not create any more.

We should speak of varying abilities rather than disability.  During my 35 years working as a primary school teacher I viewed children with a disability as young people of varying abilities and always focused on their abilities rather than their disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  As has been said, this is half a Bill and it is being rushed through without being fully drafted to be ready for enactment to honour the ratification of the United Nations convention.  We in Ireland signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, and Fianna F&aacute;il broadly supports the provisions of this Bill to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There is an urgency here as the convention followed decades of work by the United Nations to change attitudes and approaches to persons with varying degrees of abilities.  We must move away from viewing persons with disability as \"objects\" of charity, medical treatment and social protection towards viewing persons with varying degrees of disabilities as \"subjects\" with rights, who can claim those rights and make their own decisions for their lives, where possible, as well as being active members of our communities.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has been very strong on this point.<\/p>  <p>  That the Bill is incomplete, with at least another six sections planned for introduction on Committee Stage, significantly limits the potential for a detailed analysis and debate on those sections, upon which meaningful commentary may be provided by relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to the removal of barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society and exercising their rights and entitlements as citizens.  In this regard, why is it taking the Government so long to replace the motorised transport grant that was discontinued in February 2013?  At that time people were told an alternative scheme was being devised to replace it and we are now nearly four years on from then.  It has been raised in this House on numerous occasions over the past 12 months by many Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  The primary medical certificate scheme relates to a certificate issued by the Health Service Executive, HSE, which certifies that a person is a severely disabled and permanently disabled person for the purposes of Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  Some of the benefits of this certificate are that one may qualify for a refund of vehicle registration tax, value added tax, VAT, and excise duty if one buys a new or second-hand car.  A person may also qualify for exemption of road tax and a refund of VAT on motor fuel up to certain limits.  However, the criteria used to determine entitlement to this certificate are severely restrictive and should be re-examined.  At least three Deputies raised the issue last week under questions about promised legislation, mentioning its application to blind people and those with various difficulties not covered by the scheme.  With regard to disabled persons' grants, such as the housing adaptation grant, a formal national policy must be designed to standardise the administration of the grants throughout the country and their interpretation by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 deals with the duty put on employers and some service providers to accommodate reasonably the needs of people with disabilities.  Inclusion Ireland has indicated it is deeply regrettable that Ireland will enter a reservation with regard to reasonable accommodation and different levels of reasonable accommodation, such as \"nominal costs\" for private services and \"disproportionate burden\" for public services in employment law, will operate in tandem.<\/p><p>I welcome section 5, which deals with civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, bringing this sector back within Part 5 of the Disability Act, providing a 3% quota of employment for people with disabilities.  Regarding other workplace schemes for people with disabilities, I want easier access to the EmployAbility scheme and more assistance for people to retain and keep jobs in the long term.  Too many of these schemes are short-term work placements and do not serve the needs of many people with disabilities who want to reside and work in their communities.<br\/><br\/>As Deputy Catherine Connolly said, the 2011 census found that 13% of the population had a disability, and only 21% of those people aged 15 and over were working.  I want to see a much higher percentage of places on work schemes ring-fenced for people with disabilities within their communities where they feel they are making a contribution.  A similar figure of 3% or more would allow people who normally would not be able to get permanent work to feel they are making a valuable contribution.  They should be allowed permanency on those work schemes where work is not available.<br\/><br\/>I am dismayed that some extremely important aspects of this Bill are being delayed and will be introduced only on Committee stage.  These include deprivation of liberty issues, fitness for trial and tax matters on behalf of incapacitated persons.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has said, &ldquo;In the absence of published draft legislation, it is difficult for the Commission to discharge its function to examine legislative proposals under Article 10(2)(<i>e<\/i>) of the 2014 Act and to make concrete recommendations which can be of utility to the Legislature, particularly in relation to this aspect of reform.&rdquo;  This concern is also shared by Inclusion Ireland, which is concerned about legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty.  The Centre for Disability Law and Policy also has grave concerns about important aspects of the Bill being introduced only on Committee State.  In light of these concerns, Fianna F&aacute;il proposes that it may be worthwhile for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to hear in public from interested parties when the amendments are published and before Committee Stage.  I respectfully ask that this proposal be considered.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is in the process, albeit very slowly, of moving from institutionalisation and congregated settings to community living.  Adequate supports and services are required if people with disabilities are to live independently, become a part of the community and have a value within the community.  I want to see the removal of barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society and exercising their rights and entitlements as citizens.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Minister of State's visit to Drogheda, where he viewed the WALK PEER programme and the work being achieved under the programme by students in St. Brigid's school in Ard Easmuinn and St. Ita's special school in Drogheda.  The House has constantly called on the Minister of State to enhance and mainstream the programme.  Anybody who was there to witness the 100 students, their manner and approach to the programme and the values they achieved from it would know it is a no-brainer to ensure the programme is enhanced.  I refer to the issue of a particular situation at St. John of God's in Drumcar, where more than 100 people with long-term intellectual disabilities are in danger of losing access to the property due to HIQA's evaluation of it.  This shows the lack of investment for people who may not be able to participate fully in society.  We must address the financial issues associated with it.<br\/><br\/>Many years ago, under the old health board system, it was proposed that an advocate for people with disabilities would be promoted for those who do not necessarily have a voice for themselves through their family or otherwise.  People in State employment or otherwise would offer themselves to match with people with disabilities to ensure they get correct access and advocacy.  It is worth considering this, even in terms of those who step up to the mark getting something in return for putting the voluntary effort into assisting people.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Catherine Connolly referred to the Barcelona declaration on accessibility and design.  The Minister of State's Department must work particularly hard with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the local authorities to address car parking and footpaths in poor repair.  In Dundalk, a number of organisations have asked local authority members, Deputies and others to see what it is like to have a disability and see the impact of poor infrastructure.  I compliment the voluntary bodies and State organisations too numerous to mention which daily help enhance our disability services.<br\/><br\/>Many years ago, my local authority was the first to introduce the concept of an age-friendly county.  This has been extended across a number of counties.  A concept can be difficult to realise and financial constraints do not necessarily allow everything to be achieved.  However, if the D&aacute;il were to take on disability and the issues surrounding it, and if it were the focus of every Deputy who is constantly being bombarded at clinics and over the phone by people looking for services, we would be a much better society for it.  Integration benefits not only people with disabilities but those who have a greater ability.  The effect in terms of understanding disability is probably twice as valuable as the integration that happens regarding education provision.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il will support the legislation.  We would like a lot more to be done.  Personally, I believe actions speak louder than words and where there is a will, there is a way.  I would like the House to deliver on disability during this Government and beyond.  This is my first opportunity to wish the Minister of State well in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300022#U00300","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487861700,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300023#V00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487861700,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Although I will not need 20 minutes, it was important to avail of a short space of time to make a contribution on people with disabilities.  I acknowledge the role the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, played for many years fighting for people in the disability sector.  Long before I became a Member of the House I was aware of his fight for people with disabilities.  As Minister of State, he has a serious responsibility.  He is linking up with many groups up and down the country.  Like my colleagues, I welcome the Bill.  While there are shortcomings in it, we are on the right road and we must move as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As has been pointed out, Ireland signed the CRPD in 2007.  Since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland's commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative requirements under the convention are met.<\/p><p>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol were adopted on 13 December 2006 at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York and were opened for signature on 13 March 2007.  I disagree slightly with my good friend Deputy Boyd Barrett, in that Fianna F&aacute;il does not have a difficulty with this and never tried to hold up the signing of the convention.  It is extremely important and we must put it into its proper position as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>There were 82 signatories to the convention,\u00a044 signatories to the optional protocol and one ratification of the convention.  This was the highest number of signatories in history to a UN convention.  It is the first comprehensive human rights treaty of the 21st century and is the first human rights convention to be open for signature by regional integration organisations.  The convention entered into force on 3 May 2008.<br\/><br\/>Some points have already been made, but I will make a few general points that I consider to be important.  It is good that the Bill is before the House but I believe it is incomplete in some areas.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is worried that a significant number of provisions in the Bill are due to be introduced on Committee Stage as amendments, which significantly limits the scope for a detailed analysis upon which meaningful commentary can be provided by the commission.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has stated this problem is especially acute in respect of the deprivation of liberty aspect of the Bill.  It went on to note:<\/p><blockquote>The human rights and equality implications of how deprivation of liberty is regulated are highly dependent upon the processes and safeguards which will accompany the provision.  In order to carry out a meaningful analysis of the adequacy of safeguards from a human rights and equality perspective, it is necessary to consider the particulars of the proposal; including for example, the scope of the reform [which is critical], how detention will be reviewed, the particulars of an appeal mechanism together with the remedies proposed to allow a person to obtain appropriate redress and reparation.  In the absence of published draft legislation, it is difficult for the Commission to discharge its function to examine legislative proposals under Article 10(2)(e) of the 2014 Act and to make concrete recommendations which can be of utility to the legislature, particularly in relation to this aspect of reform.<\/blockquote><p>This concern is also shared by Inclusion Ireland, which states:<\/p><blockquote>Legislative clarity is required on the issue of deprivation of liberty.  Persons can only be detained in accordance with law e.g. prisoners, involuntary mental patients but in Ireland, persons may be de facto detained not in accordance with law.<\/blockquote><p>These are some of the concerns and others already have been mentioned.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to address those matters in the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on disability, Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony, also will bring forward amendments on aspects of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to Fianna F&aacute;il's involvement in standing up for people with disability.  We all must acknowledge that more could have been done by everybody but our party has always been committed to creating a more inclusive society and to dismantling barriers across a range of sectors that prevent people with disability from fully participating in society.  We all must accept that those barriers have been there for many years.  We are now in the process - and getting on well with it - of breaking down those barriers.  We need to ensure that people with disabilities are given equality of opportunity so they can participate in society to the best of their wonderful abilities.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always been committed to fighting discrimination in all forms.  When in government, Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward policies and legislation to advance the rights of people with disabilities.  Our vision and proactive approach in government has made a positive impact on the lives of people with disabilities.  I will not go into some of the procedures and laws we brought forward but they are there to be seen.  They were not enough but they certainly were of help and brought forward this debate over many years, especially when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.<br\/><br\/>On a more general point, I have a serious issue with members of the public taking up parking spaces that are allocated for people who have a disability.  The facility is abused all over the State.  In some towns the law may not be able to deal with it but I would hope that somewhere in the Bill we would look again at parking spaces that are for people with a disability and that the spaces are not abused by other members of the public.  It is horrendous.  I witnessed such a scene in my town recently where a person with a disability came around to use such a space and it had been taken up by a car, which was driven by a person without a disability.  What was worse, the person who had a severe disability had to park almost 400 yd. away, down off a main street, and had to come back a distance in order to conduct her business in the town.  I saw this scenario in action and it is deplorable.  I condemn those members of the public who willy-nilly drive into these spaces that by law, are there for people who have a disability.  I appeal to those of us who do not have a disability to never, ever take up those spaces.<br\/><br\/>There is an issue with waste refuse services when people have disabilities, both for older people and families who have children with autism.  If incontinence is an issue there are disposable nappies and the refuse charges are enormous in this regard.  Obviously, people must look after their sick family members.  The Minister of State should consider a scheme that could help those people.  It is an enormous financial cost on many families and I hear about it a lot in my clinic.  I would love if we could do something about this.  I do not know if anything could be done in the Bill, but perhaps the Minister of State could discuss it with his Cabinet colleagues and consider a scheme that might, in some way, aid people who are under severe financial strain because of these costs.  Maybe action could be taken, in conjunction with local authorities, to help these people.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by paying the highest compliment possible to those parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters of people who have a disability.  In general, Irish families are outstanding in looking after people with disability.  We also must acknowledge the generosity of members of the wider public, who constantly annually fundraise for so many causes that support people with disability.  Without their effort we would not have many of the services that are in place.  While acknowledging the State's role, grant assistance etc., where would we be without those volunteers? Many of those who are involved in the voluntary sector do not have a family member with a disability.  This is a tremendous testament to the people who do such work in a voluntary capacity, as well as to the many businesses nationwide who give so much to local community groups who try to help with facilities for people with disability.  I think of all the groups in my native town of Strokestown, in Castlerea and in the Roscommon area with the Hub group, the Brothers of Charity services among others, as well as St. Christopher's Services in Longford, of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  There is huge voluntary effort going in to all of these groups to make life better for those who have a disability.  I salute those people here today and congratulate them.  I urge more people to come on board to assist in whatever way they can in making life better for members of society who have a disability and to help their families.  Sometimes it is not always possible to get the amount of respite care that is needed.<\/p><p>Often, it is family and friends who come in to help parents with respite care.<br\/><br\/>I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill and want to let him know that amendments will be put forward from this side.  I wish him well with his job.  We hope the Government does not fall so he can put his programme in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300023#V00300","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487862900,"counter":254,"content":"<p>That would be all I need.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for and commend them on their valuable contributions.  This is a matter on which we have overall agreement.  There was a strong focus on the rights of the person with a disability.  I recognise the valuable and constructive ideas put forward by Deputies Murphy O'Mahony, Breathnach, Eugene Murphy and Boyd Barrett.  I also welcome Senator John Dolan, who is involved with the Disability Federation of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Let me first clear the decks on a number of issues.  I will respond in more detail in respect of them on Committee Stage.  First, on the lack of consultation, since I took over as Minister of State I have met over 4,500 people, including disabled individuals, voluntary groups, professional groups and service providers.  I have an open door and, if there is anybody I did not meet, my door is still open.  Let us get that clear.  There is no question of me not being involved in consultation.  I see myself as a Minister of State who listens.  When I get constructive ideas, as I did in the past few days, it is important that I listen to them.  We will return to each of these issues on Committee Stage, when I will be able to put detailed, point-by-point responses on the record.<\/p>  <p>  I want to deal with a number of the key matters that have been raised.  I would have preferred to include all the necessary provisions in the Bill, as published, but I want to get things moving.  It was always the intention, even when the general scheme was approved by the previous Government, that the deprivation of liberty provisions would be advanced by means of Committee Stage amendments.  This was, and is, a simple acknowledgement of the complexity and importance of the issue.  However, these heads will be published as soon as they are finalised and before the Office of the Attorney General settles the final detail of the text.  The heads will be presented to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which, as Deputy Murphy O'Mahony suggested, will be free to conduct hearings on this specific part of the Bill, if it so wishes.  Let us have hearings if Members want them.  There will be time for analysis and commentary, as requested by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, on this aspect by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or disability interests in advance of Committee Stage.  Those are some of the issues I am taking on board before we get into the nitty-gritty.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission&rsquo;s role, the view in the Department and in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office is that we already have the independent mechanism that is required for this convention, namely, the commission itself.  The commission is fully compliant with the Paris Principles and it is simply a question of giving it a specific disability function.  That function should be a wide one and it need not mention the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities specifically.  The form of words used in the Bill is broad enough to cover this and any other future international instrument that may be relevant.<\/p>  <p>  During the debate, several Deputies asked about the involvement of persons with disabilities in monitoring the conventions.  Sections 3 and 6 of the Bill set out the monitoring process as envisaged by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, supported by the National Disability Authority, will carry out this role.  If Deputies look closely, they will see that the Bill provides for the establishment of an advisory committee and that at least half of the members should have, or have had, a disability.  The facilitation of the participation of all members of the committee will be ensured by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  A number of Deputies mentioned the constitutional difficulty in regard to reasonable accommodation.  The details are set out in the roadmap published in October 2015.  We have gone as far as we can, while keeping within the interpretation of the Constitution delivered by the Supreme Court.<\/p>  <p>  If the proposed anti-discrimination directive published in 2008 by the European Commission is adopted, we will be bound by that and can apply, across the board, the \"not exceeding a disproportionate burden\" standard contained in the UN convention.  In the meantime, the House cannot recommend provisions for the Bill that are unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court decision hinged on the protection of private property rights catered for in the Constitution.  The Deputies opposite and I might wish for a different interpretation but, in our system, the Constitution is interpreted by the Supreme Court and the other branches of Government - the Executive arm and the Oireachtas - must accept that.  For those who quoted from the analysis in the submission of the Disability Law Centre in Galway, they might ask the centre how exactly it is that a Supreme Court decision on private property rights is overturned by High Court decisions on entirely different issues.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies mentioned our proposed declarations in respect of Article 12 and Article 14.  I want to make it clear that we fully accept and will conform to both of these articles.  The problem arises due to the misinterpretation of said articles, in an extremist way, by the UN committee, which we and other countries, such as Australia, Norway and Canada, cannot accept as a valid interpretation of the convention.  I look forward to setting out a detailed explanation in respect of this point on Committee Stage.  Essentially, the committee is of the view that persons with mental illness or intellectual disability who commit criminal acts should be treated as criminals.  Our law does not allow a person to be found guilty of a crime if that person does not have the capacity to understand that the act was wrong.  Instead, the person can be found not guilty by reason of insanity and, if appropriate and necessary, detained for treatment.  This approach is much more humane and in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities than the quite strange misinterpretation put forward by the UN committee.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention juries, an issue raised by Deputies Pringle and Murphy O'Mahony.  We are proposing to remove inappropriate restrictions on eligibility to serve on a jury.  I am willing to look at issues in regard to reasonable accommodation again.  However, let me be clear that there are competing constitutional rights here.  The right to a fair trial takes precedence over the right of any person, with a disability or not, to be eligible to serve on a jury.  That is the way it has to be and that is what we need to keep in mind.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Brady, Martin Kenny, O'Brien and others made the point that other countries ratify without changing their legislation and asked why we cannot do the same.  They raise a very important issue on which people have different views, and even within Government there are different opinions.  I am not in the business of making meaningless gestures.  I want this to be fully compliant with the UN convention and the Government is fully behind me on that, as is the Opposition, which is fantastic and a very important help to me.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue raised is that the word \"equality\" needs to be included in the Title.  I accept that point very strongly and I will ask the Attorney General to ensure we that fix this on Committee Stage.  I can confirm that we will remove references to unsound mind where these remain in Acts that are still in operation.  The Companies Act is being addressed separately by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and will be amended.  These are important issues.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise some final points on consultation.  I emphasise that if I left out somebody, my door is open and I am ready to talk.  We have had genuine consultation with disability interests on the development of the new national disability inclusion strategy and this ratification process.  The Department of Justice and Equality held two rounds of public meetings in Dublin, Cork, and Tullamore, at which issues in regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the wider disability strategy were discussed.  The Disability Stakeholders Group and the national steering committee for the strategy, which I chair, also provided opportunities for input by disability interests.  Therefore, we have had consultation but, if anyone has been excluded, we will definitely listen to them.  As noted earlier, the justice committee has the authority to bring them in on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I am looking at putting the word \"equality\" back into that legislation.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien was one of the first people to mention it during the debate.  I am a listening Minister and I look forward to constructive ideas.<\/p> <p> I conclude by thanking all the Deputies for their contributions.  I hope to return on Committee Stage soon.  There is a lot of work to be done, particularly in respect of the deprivation of liberty.  There will be no delay as far I am concerned.  I was annoyed by the way events last week in the D&aacute;il meant that Second Stage of this Bill was delayed until this week.  It would be wrong to underestimate what remains to be done.  We can resume our examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.  In response to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's question during the previous debate, we will resume when we have all the remaining pieces of the Bill available and when we have adequate time to consider them, including adequate time for Deputies to consult with stakeholders.  I will take on board any views.  If any particular group has contacted Deputies in recent weeks that we might have left out by accident, the door is open and I will meet it.  I have met many groups.  I was criticised by some Deputies.  When I visited the Centre for Independent Living in Galway before Christmas, a meeting that was attended by 300 people, they told me that they knew I was under pressure to ratify the UN convention but that I should bring in a strong Bill and that if it took time to do it properly, I should take that time rather than bring in a flawed Bill.  That was the advice I got from them.  I was disappointed by the delay.  I set myself a target of the end of December 2016 but we are back in business and, hopefully, we will complete Second Stage today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300025#X00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487863500,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Do not forget about DART stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1487863500,"counter":257,"content":"<p>The answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487863500,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1487863500,"counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1487863500,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y00600","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487863500,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017: Order for Second Stage","time":1487863500,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1487863500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y00900","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487863500,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017: Second Stage","time":1487863500,"counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1487863500,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to introduce the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017 to the House.  This is an issue that is very close to my heart.  Like many Deputies, I have worked tirelessly for many years in my local community.  I have seen at first hand the destructive power of drugs and drug addiction.  I have seen what it does to people, to their families and to whole communities.  It is truly awful and heartbreaking.  This Bill is one part of a much bigger piece of work that needs to be done and is being done to reduce the impact of drugs, drug abuse and addiction in Ireland today.  The soon to be completed national drugs strategy will seek further to shape this approach.<\/p>  <p>  There is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and other cities and towns in Ireland.  I have seen it on my own doorstep and I know many Deputies will have witnessed it themselves.  It is unhygienic and unsafe.  Street injectors are at risk from diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV.  They risk getting ulcers and other infections.  Ultimately, they risk death from overdose.  The wider community and the general public are also at risk due to the discarded syringes left behind on streets and in alleyways.  Nobody chooses to inject drugs on the streets, down an alleyway or behind a bin.  This is where the most desperate in our society have been driven.  We must reach out to help those who find themselves in this most chaotic stage of addiction.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of supervised injecting facilities is one way of reaching out to these people.  An injecting room is a controlled environment where drug users may inject drugs they have brought with them.  These facilities have proved to be effective in reaching out to these marginalised groups, those who use drugs on the streets or who have little interaction with existing services.  In an injecting centre, drug users can get access to clean injecting equipment.  There will be trained staff to provide emergency care if they suffer an overdose and there will be an opportunity to have minor health issues treated by a doctor or a nurse.  They can access other health and social care services where previously their addiction or their personal situation meant they were unable to do so.  An injecting centre can be a way back from the desperate situation in which a lot of street injectors find themselves.  As a result, the injecting centre will also help with other problems associated with injecting on the street, including drug-related litter and the local amenity.<\/p>  <p>  We are not alone in considering this course of action.  There are around 90 drug consumption rooms operating around the world.  They are in cities such as Luxembourg, Copenhagen. Barcelona, Sydney and Vancouver.  Last autumn, the first centre in France opened in Paris.  Two more are planned.  Last year, Lisbon approved a proposal to open up a centre as soon as possible.  Glasgow is also working towards opening a centre, the first of its kind in the UK.  Evidence from the long-running sites demonstrates a reduction in fatal overdoses and the risk of transmitting blood-borne diseases.  They show a decrease in the amount of public injecting.  There are significant reductions in drug-related litter.  A fourfold reduction was seen in Barcelona with an almost 80% reduction in Copenhagen.  Drug consumption rooms have been operating for over 30 years and nobody has ever died as a result of an overdose in any of them.<\/p>  <p>  First and foremost, injecting centres are a form of harm reduction.  I know that the idea may seem strange at first and I can understand people's initial reaction to the idea of an injecting centre.  I was sceptical when I first stepped into this role but I have read the evidence and met with doctors and counsellors who work in them.  I have spoken with police officers who worked in the area.  My officials and I have visited centres in Europe.  The evidence is very clear.  Injecting centres do not promote drug use.  They do not create, cause or permit drug crime.  An injecting centre is not a free-for-all for those who want to inject drugs.  It simply works to prevent injury and death and connect people with health services.  The evidence shows injecting centres do not cause an increase in the use of drugs or drug-related crime.  There is no evidence for the so-called \"honey-pot effect\".<\/p>  <p>  This Bill and injecting centres will not be the solution to the drugs problem but drug use and drug addiction is a complex and difficult problem.  We have to try something different to help these people who are marginalised because of their addiction.  An injecting centre cannot work in isolation.  It must be part of a wider framework of services.  It should only be one part of a range of harm reduction measures that we should be able to use to address the issue.  Injecting centres can also only succeed through co-operation and engagement between key local stakeholders - health care workers, the garda&iacute;, local authorities and, importantly, local communities.  This legislation is only the first step on that road.  I have asked the HSE to establish a working group to identify the practical issues of setting up a pilot service in Dublin city centre.  I reassure Deputies that no decision relating to a final location has been taken.  As part of this work, the HSE will be undertaking a process of consultation, including with local stakeholders and communities.<\/p>  <p>  In A Programme for a Partnership Government, we committed to supporting a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drug use.  The programme reaffirmed this Government's commitment to legislate for injecting rooms and this Bill is a priority for this D&aacute;il session.  This Bill will not establish the location of the facility.  It simply provides enabling legislation where currently it is illegal to provide or use such a centre.  However, it is intended that the first centre will be a pilot to determine the suitability and effectiveness of injecting rooms in an Irish context.<\/p><p>I know many people have concerns about where the first pilot facility will be located.  I assure the House that no decisions have been made.  First, we must bring forward this enabling legislation before those steps can be taken.<\/p> <p> Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 it is currently an offence to provide an injecting centre.  Service users would also be guilty of several offences.  A change to existing legislation is required to facilitate the introduction of these centres.  The previous Government approved the drafting of heads to provide for injecting centres.<\/p> <p> The Bill contains 13 sections.  I will proceed to explain each section in turn.<\/p> <p> Section 1 deals with interpretation.  The provisions it contains are standard and they include a number of new definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  The section includes definitions for \"drug\", \"licence\" and \"supervised injecting facility\".  The definition of \"drug\" will include controlled drugs and psychoactive substances, sometimes referred to as \"head-shop\" drugs.  The type of injectable drugs that service users bring in to the centre will not be restricted to heroin, for example.  To do so would not assist in reducing the harm associated with these newer head-shop drugs.<\/p> <p> Sections 2 and 3 cover application for a licence and the granting of a licence.  Section 2 provides for the information that should be included in an application.  This will include the name and relevant experiences of the person applying for a licence.  The address of the proposed premises and the details of the proposal to be put in place for the operation as well as clinical governance of the centre must also be supplied.  Should any application not contain enough detail, the Minister is enabled to seek further information.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides the criteria by which the Minister may be satisfied to consider granting a licence.  These include, but are not limited to, consultation with the Garda, the HSE and others, as the Minister considers appropriate.  It also includes the matters the HSE will consider when advising the Minister on the appropriateness of such an application.  The HSE is best placed to assess the clinical governance and operational protocols proposed for a premises and to ensure that it is fit-for-purpose.  In addition, there will be consideration of whether the location of a proposed centre is appropriate given the level and nature of drug use in any area.  The HSE will advise the Minister accordingly.<\/p> <p> Section 3 also grants the Minister the authority to attach conditions to a particular licence.  These conditions shall be informed by consultation with the Garda, the HSE or others.  Such a licence will be for a fixed period.  However, it may be surrendered by the licence holder, or suspended or revoked by the Minister.  The licence may also be extended by the Minister following consultation with the HSE and the Garda.<\/p> <p> Sections 4, to 6, inclusive, deal with the surrender, suspension and transfer of a licence.  These sections provide for a licence holder to be able to surrender or to seek to transfer a licence for a particular centre.  However, written notice of a fixed period must be provided to the Minister before a centre can be closed.  These provisions ensure that adequate service provision continues should the effectiveness of a centre remain positive.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides for the Minister to revoke or suspend the licence based on the input of the Garda or HSE with immediate effect should there be a serious and immediate risk to life.  Under this section, the conditions attached to a licence may be amended or added to, as the Minister sees fit, and may take into account the views of the HSE, the Garda and others.<\/p> <p> In Section 6 the licence for a particular premises must be transferred to another licence holder to maintain continuity of service, should this be considered necessary.<\/p> <p> Section 7 includes the definition of an \"authorised user\".  It also provides the authority of a licence holder to permit a person to be in an injecting centre.  An \"authorised user\" will be an individual who is on the premises of the injecting centre in accordance with the conditions of the licence and with the permission of the licence holder.  A person cannot be an authorised user outside of the centre.  To become an authorised user, advanced, overwhelming and complex registration with the service will not be required.  However, the status of authorised user will depend on the premises of the licence holder.  Therefore, a service user who has been asked to leave the premises, or who will be in breach of the conditions of the licence, will not be afforded exemption from certain offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.<\/p> <p> Section 8 relates to the obligation of the licence holder to provide information.  Section 8 provides for unidentified data to be shared with the Minister or the HSE for the purposes of evaluating the centre.  Personal records cannot be shared.<\/p> <p> Section 9 relates to the liability of the licence holder.  This section provides an exemption for the licence holder from liability for providing an injecting centre and any assistance, advice or care given to an authorised user.<\/p> <p> The Bill has been carefully drafted to address the health-related harm associated with public injecting while ensuring that the misuse of drugs legislation remains undiluted.  Section 10 provides that certain sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 will not apply under certain circumstances.  Section 3 of the 1977 Act makes it an offence to be in possession of a controlled drug.  The offence of possession of a controlled drug would not apply to an \"authorised user\" as defined under section 7 of this Bill.  Section 19 of the 1977 Act makes it an offence for the occupier, controller or manager of any premises to permit the possession, manufacture, production or preparation of a controlled drug on the premises.  The licence holder for an injecting centre will be exempted from such an offence.  Finally, section 21 of the 1977 Act provides that it is an offence to contravene or fail to comply with the regulations made under the Act.  This section of the Bill ensures that authorised users will not be in breach of the relevant regulations.<\/p> <p> Section 11 relates to provision of access for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This section provides for a member of the Garda to enter an injecting centre without a warrant for the prevention or detection of offences.  It is normal practice for police in other countries to call into injecting centres on a regular basis.<\/p> <p> Section 12 provides for the Minister for Health to make various regulations for the purposes of the Bill and section 13 covers the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions.  These are standard provisions.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to bring forward this legislation.  It is a compassionate and practical response to the chilling reality of drug users injecting and overdosing in public.  Injecting centres create a safe harbour for chronic drug users.  The centres will provide a controlled place for people to inject, but they will be far more than that.  I believe in a health-led and person-centred approach to the drug problem.  This is also about people and looking after the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society.  The human cost of public injecting is clear and keeps adding up.  The cost includes lack of dignity and the effect this activity has on people's health, well-being and safety.  We know these facilities are not the solution to the drugs problem.  Many other steps are needed.  However, I am committed to do everything I can to help those who need it most.  I hope and expect that all in the House will fully support the Bill and help to ensure its smooth and speedy passage through the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300026#Y01200","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487864700,"counter":268,"content":"<p>As my party's spokesperson on the national drugs strategy, I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I and my party are always open to considering new and innovative ways to tackle drug abuse and help those who suffer with drug addiction.  The nature of, and problems associated with, drug-taking are very different today from what was happening over 30 years ago so, as legislators, we have a responsibility to respond and to be open to new and more nuanced approaches as required.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill as we are of the view it will help to reduce the incidence of drug-related deaths.  We believe a supervised injecting centre in Dublin should be introduced on a pilot basis, as provided for in the legislation.  There should be regular reviews to measure the success of the centre.  Input from stakeholders, the Garda and local groups will be important in this regard.  How this policy is implemented will be crucial to its success or failure.<\/p>  <p>  I am equally of the view that the introduction of such facilities will not solve or end the scourge of problem drug taking in Ireland.  A supervised injecting centre should be viewed as just a part of a range of measures and services to address this problem.  It more important that the Government acts to fund and deliver more detoxification centres, more support services for those who want to tackle their addiction, more emphasis on education and prevention and more focus on treatment and rehabilitation.  It is disappointing that the programme for Government formally proposes few other measures.  This centre is one of the positive measures proposed in the programme but we must outline further measures that could positively assist in addressing many of the issues with drug abuse in Ireland.  The national drug strategy is due to be published later this year and I hope the Minister takes on board the submissions made by my party, other parties in the House and the many interest groups to prioritise these measures.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has the highest rate of intravenous heroin use in Europe.  Consequently, the rate of drug-related deaths here is three times the European average, which is shocking.  Two people die from drug related deaths every day in Ireland.  This is simply unacceptable.  Everybody should reflect on those figures.\u00a0 The Minister referred to the many other morbidities associated with injecting, such as hepatitis C and HIV.  There is a direct correlation between those and allowing addicts to be left on our streets, without intervention or harm reduction.  The positive aspect of the Bill is that we can provide people with access to a wraparound service when they are in such a vulnerable position.<\/p>  <p>  We must ask how we allowed this situation to develop and, more importantly, what we must do to address it.  Since being appointed party spokesperson on drugs I have been visiting and engaging with stakeholders in the area of drug treatment, prevention and rehabilitation.  I have met with relevant groups and many of the task forces in Dublin and across the country.  We cannot fool ourselves that this is just a Dublin or urban problem.  It is a problem for every household on every road across the country.  Drug taking is a problem that affects every family.  I have visited the Tiglin residential treatment centre in Wicklow and the Rutland Centre and I have met with local and regional drugs and alcohol task forces.  I visited the Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; Aislinn centre in County Kilkenny, one of the country&rsquo;s few adolescent treatment centres, which has struggled to get the proper level of funding to provide its excellent service for vulnerable adolescents.  In Dublin city, I visited Merchants Quay Ireland and the Ana Liffey Drug Project, to name just two.  All of these groups are doing admirable work, in the most testing of environments with the tightest of budgets.  The latter two have recommended the introduction of a supervised injecting facility.  Both of the groups see and experience daily how drugs destroy lives and devastate families.  They are well placed to offer input in this area.<\/p>  <p>  A supervised injecting facility can only be successful if it is considered the start point for recovery, not the end point for shooting up.  Injecting facilities must be a pathway to effective treatment and rehabilitation.  That is the constant challenge.  The level of services the HSE provides is not enough, and the level of funding is always difficult in the context of the health budget.  It is hard for people who do not have a voice to get the funding they deserve.  If we enact this legislation, and I hope it will progress quickly through the Oireachtas, we must then discuss how we give hope and proper intervention and treatment to people in such a vulnerable situation.  The real challenge is how we match this approach with the services they deserve.  The injecting room should be part of a network of services housed in the same centre to facilitate this.  If successful, this centre has the potential to become a broader, viable public health measure.  At the very least, it has the potential to provide individuals with some dignity and a safe place while we work to help them overcome addiction.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the concerns that have been raised about pursuing this measure.  However, we must have an evidence based approach.  Injecting facilities are a relatively new development and much of the research is still in the early stages.  Studies by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction indicate injecting centres can be successful in reducing drug related deaths and morbidity.  There have also been reported decreases in drug related litter in many of the cities where they have been introduced.  Overall, the evidence does not support the contention that injecting centres lead to an increase in drug-related crime in an area.  We must adhere to an evidence based approach to this discussion, not a mythical approach that is put forward by stakeholders who do not have the interests of the vulnerable people concerned in mind.  They must focus on the evidence, not the mythology.  There are now approximately 90 injecting centres across Europe and nobody has died in any of them.  Staffed by trained health care professionals, the safety of these centres should not be questioned.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an economic argument for injecting centres.  When drug users are using the same facilities, it frees up health and other resources considerably.  When an injecting centre opened in Australia, there was an 80% drop in ambulance call outs.  Paramedics were no longer having to deal with overdoses or related incidents, which meant they were better able to respond to emergencies and ultimately save lives.  When considering other areas of health care, including community based health care, we are focusing on primary care and making interventions before people end up in an acute situation.  The same should apply for the vulnerable addicts who are on our streets.  They should have a place where they can access harm reduction, so an acute situation does not arise for them and they do not overdose and end up in hospital for a period of time.  A wraparound intervention and treatment for them is what this Bill seeks to provide.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the programme for Government, I am pleased there is now a recognition of the need to promote the health aspect of dealing with drug addiction.  As I said in my party&rsquo;s submission to the national drugs strategy, tackling the country&rsquo;s crippling drug problem requires major reform in our overall approach.  Every day we hear stories of individuals, families and communities around the country that have been devastated by drugs.  The renewed focus on this area is welcome, as is the development of the new national drug strategy which will shape our policies in trying to tackle this problem in the coming years.  The passing of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act last year highlighted clearly how legislators must stay on top of a constantly evolving environment where clever and ruthless drug dealers use every loophole, grey area and opportunity they can to intimidate and prey on vulnerable people and make profits from the victims of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Drug-related harm consistently clusters in communities marked by poverty and social inequality.  Research shows that this situation was allowed to develop by the policies of many Governments and year-on-year funding cuts.  We must be mindful of this.  The economy is growing at present but if it should decline, we must ensure that the core services for the most vulnerable people are maintained and that there is a proper funding model for the services to continue the level of intervention they are currently providing.  That is the importance of harm reduction.  Equally important is the need to develop proper treatment, rehabilitation, therapeutic and aftercare services.  In this regard, we have proposed in our submission the roll-out, on a pilot basis, of therapeutic communities within prisons to help offenders overcome drug addiction.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, under its Chairman, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is trying to engage in a better way on penal reform and on how to provide the level of intervention in our prison system that is not currently being provided.<\/p>  <p>  As work gets under way on the new national drugs strategy, more emphasis should be placed on prevention and education.  This should start with our younger people.  Greater emphasis must be placed on the teaching of social, personal and health education, SPHE, in schools and informing children about the dangers of drugs.<\/p><p>Former users, as well as health care professionals and garda&iacute; and inter-agency collaboration, are crucial in this regard and can play an important role in educating and preventing young people from going down the road of using drugs.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, I am trying to highlight the need for a multifaceted, multi-agency approach which is properly resourced to tackle drug addiction.  The injecting centres in this legislation, if correctly introduced and managed, can be an important step on the road to tackling this problem once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300028#AA00100","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487865300,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I have been calling for this legislation for a number of years and, at the outset, it is only appropriate to mention Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, the predecessor of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, because he was a champion of this legislation in the previous D&aacute;il and faced some stiff opposition to it.  Had it not been for his doggedness in trying to get this issue moved on, I do not think we would be here today.<\/p>  <p>  I will get to the Bill in a minute but I want to touch on some of the falsities that are being put about, and also some of the negative press and commentary around the provision of an injecting centre.  People will ask if there is a need for one.  We should consider in that context that 13 million people worldwide inject drugs every single day.  In this State alone, the latest figures we can work off, which are old figures from 2014, show nearly 10,000 people receiving treatment for opiate use.  In 2014, more than 16,500 people entered treatment for a drug problem.  Of those, 4,500 were opiate users or opiates were their main choice of drugs.  There were 943 new cases in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  What Deputy Chambers said is interesting, that this is not a Dublin issue, and the figures bear that out.  Of the 4,500 opiate users to whom I referred, only 2,100 were resident in Dublin.  The rest were outside Dublin.  Almost 3,000 of them were men.  Only five are registered as being under 18, but we all know that there are many more people under the age of 18 who are using heroin and other opiate-based drugs.  Only five are captured in this particular research.  More than 2,500 of them were aged between 18 and 34, and in excess of 2,500 used opiates with other drugs, so they were multi-drug users.  Some 640 people used it between two and six days per week, 294 used it once a week and, what is astonishing, in excess of 2,000 people in this State were using heroin every single day.  If that does not highlight the need to provide an injecting centre, even if only one on a pilot basis, then I do not know what does.<\/p>  <p>  On the number of people who have lost their lives as a result of drug use, again the figures are slightly behind where we are.  Between 2004 and 2014, more than 6,600 people lost their lives through drug use.  Nearly 4,000 of those deaths were due to overdose.  Over 40% of them were due to non-poisoning, which is non-overdose, causes.  A quarter of all deaths from overdose were as a result of heroin or involved heroin.  Of those who lost their lives, 87% were male and 81% of such cases involved more than one drug, so it was heroin plus another.  Of the number of people who lost their lives from using heroin, 48% were injecting the drug at the time of death.  I stress that figure because it indicates that more than half the drug related deaths due to heroin were down to non-injecting reasons - people smoking it, basically.  While this legislation is welcome and is going to address the issue of intravenous use, it does not address the issue of the 52% of people who lost their lives from smoking heroin.  We need to be cognisant of that.<\/p>  <p>  What we are providing here will help a number of people.  There is no doubt about that and I welcome it, but it is not going to address the issue of drug use in this State.  Unfortunately, we are behind the times compared with other European states.  We need to look at the evidence available.  I saw one local councillor, whom I will not name, debating with the Minister of State on a television show recently.  He said there was no evidence to suggest that injecting centres save lives.<\/p>  <p>  I want to read into the record the number of people who have had their lives saved because of these injecting centres.  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has calculated that in Germany, ten people are saved every year because of these centres.  In Canada, up to 12 deaths have been prevented every single year.  A 2011 study went into more detail.  It tracked the number of fatal overdoses in the 32 months before a centre was opened and the 27 months after the centre was opened.  It found that the rate of overdose deaths fell by 35% in the first two years of the centre's operation, while it fell by less than 10% in other areas of the city where they were not providing a supervised injecting centre.  That same report went on to say that not only did it prevent deaths, it probably prevented 35 HIV infections every year since opening.  While there is a lot of research in Australia, it does not go into the number of people who have potentially been saved, but it enables the data to be analysed and for the figures to be worked out.  They reckon that 25 overdose deaths are prevented every single year by providing these centres.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence is available, and I agree with Deputy Chambers that when we are dealing with this type of issue, the scaremongering has to go out the window and we have to rely on the evidence.  I know personally, and the Minister of State knows why, that there is a lot of stigma around people who use heroin.  We can pass this legislation, but for me that is only half the battle.  We have to open one of these facilities.  Let us be very clear that it is not going to be an easy job.  There will be many people with many issues.  There will be NIMBYism.  People will not want it in their backyard.  Those people need to take their heads out of the sand.  I have seen it in my city of Cork, where for years I was raising the issue of heroin use and people were saying not to mention it, that it was bad for tourism and bad for publicity.  The reality is people were dying on our streets.  No matter how few media articles there are about it or how quiet it is kept, the reality is people are still dying, and we can either bury our heads in the sand or do something about it.<\/p>  <p>  I would love to see one of these centres in my community and my constituency, because I have lost friends who have died from heroin overdoses.  I have almost lost family members to heroin overdoses.  There are many people whom I grew up and went to school with who, unfortunately, are not here today because they became addicted to heroin and lost their lives.  I could probably name six close friends of mine who, unfortunately, lost their lives because of overdoses, nearly all of which were down to heroin.<\/p><p>I would love to have one of these in my city.  I am quite jealous that we are planning a pilot project in Dublin.  I understand why we are doing that given that nearly half of those who inject heroin reside in Dublin.  However, more than 2,000 people outside Dublin also inject heroin and their lives are just as important.  I know people will have a battle on their hands to get this facility open.  I implore communities to recognise that such a facility does not stigmatise their community but is trying to save the lives of people who reside within that community.  They can be our neighbours, family members or people we have grown up with.  I encourage people to approach the debate with a very open mind.<\/p> <p> I said we are probably behind other international models because the injecting centre we are now looking at is what other countries were looking at ten or 15 years ago.  Many European countries are now moving beyond the injecting-centre model to a drug-consumption model, which is where we need to go eventually.  I outlined the figures.  Given that 52% of all heroin-related deaths are for non-injection reasons, the evidence is there to suggest we should move to that.  We are not just talking about heroin.  People who will be able to access these facilities could be injecting cocaine or amphetamines; although I acknowledge heroin is the predominant drug.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State will be aware, the committee carried out the pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Library and Research Service produced a fine document on it.  Page 39 of that publication covers the main issues raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny and how well the Bill addresses those concerns.  It found that the majority of observations fell into three main areas.  Unfortunately, two of the three have not been addressed in the Bill, which is disappointing.  The one area that has been addressed is the issue of an authorised user; the committee was concerned as to what is an authorised user.  I believe the Minister of State has addressed that in the legislation and I agree completely with the definition.<\/p> <p> According to section 7(1), \"A licence holder, or the person in charge of a supervised injecting centre for the time being, may authorise a person, not being a person prescribed as being ineligible to be an authorised user\".  I ask the Minister of State to explain how a person becomes ineligible.  I do not know whether that is just a legal term.  I presume the only way for a person to become ineligible is by no longer injecting and by looking to smoke or consume drugs by methods other than injection.<\/p> <p> Section 5 deals with the revocation or suspension of licence and section 5(5) refers to \"Where the Minister considers that there is a serious and immediate risk to the life, health or welfare of an authorised user, or to the well-being of the staff of that facility\".  I am not happy with that wording.  By their very nature, authorised users who are injecting heroin are in serious risk of their lives.  That is the reality of drug use.  I do not want the legislation to contain any caveat that would allow any future Minister to revoke a licence on the basis that there is a risk to an authorised user's life or health.  We need to get real.  The user is in a centre and is injecting heroin; of course there will be a risk to his or her life.<\/p> <p> At the committee I raised concerns over section 11, which gives members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na permission to enter these centres.  In order for this pilot project to be successful, in addition to getting the buy-in of local communities, the Garda and the Health Service Executive, we also need to get the buy-in of the drug users themselves.  If they do not buy into this pilot project, it will fail with devastating consequences for those individuals.<\/p> <p> I do not know how many drug users who plan to inject themselves with heroin will actually do so if there is a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na standing beside them in the facility.  I do not know how practical that is.  I can understand the Minister of State's reasons for inserting that provision.  It is obviously to prevent people from using the centre for profit through dealing and preying on vulnerable drug users.  However, we need to look at this.  At the pre-legislative scrutiny it was mooted that a code of practice could be put in place with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will not happen; the law is the law.  Garda&iacute; do not work off codes of practice; they work off what is legal and what is not legal.<\/p> <p> A heroin user in possession of heroin who is ten yards away from an injecting facility will be committing an offence.  If a garda stops that person, we will be relying on the goodwill of that garda to say, \"It's all right.  Off you go.  I know where you're off to.\"  Many garda&iacute; will do that but it will still be illegal.  We need to address the issue of decriminalisation.  While we will not do so in this legislation, we need to do it in the context of the national drugs strategy.  If we are serious about moving to a public health model we need to look at decriminalisation, which will be a very difficult conversation but we need to have it.<\/p> <p> The Bill provides that if a person is caught in possession of a controlled substance within the facility, we will \"disapply\" the law to them.  We need to put people's minds at ease.  A number of people have said to me that passing this legislation actually legalises heroin within certain facilities.  That is not the case.  My understanding is that even within a supervised injection centre, a person in possession of a controlled substance is still breaking the law.  However, we are saying that we will \"disapply\" that to individuals who are in there for the purpose of using that controlled substance.  We need to knock that myth on the head immediately.  Irrespective of whether we agree with the argument on decriminalisation, nobody in this House is proposing to legalise any controlled substance that is currently illegal.<\/p> <p> The second myth we need to knock on the head relates to drug crime.  In all the research that has been done, there is absolutely no evidence that suggests the establishment of a drug injecting centre increases drug crime in the locality.  On the contrary all the evidence suggests it decreases drug crime.<\/p> <p> I hope we can progress the legislation quickly.  When it is passed the Minister of State will have a job of work regarding the regulations for providing a licence.  It cannot be too restrictive.  We cannot allow the regulations on providing a licence to become a stick that people opposed to this legislation can use to beat us.  We need to provide this centre because it is the right thing to do.  There is no such thing as a good decision or a bad decision when it comes to providing an injecting centre, only the right decision or the wrong decision.<\/p><p>It is the right decision to provide these types of facilities.  The facilities in question are not just about allowing somebody to walk in off the street and inject himself or herself with an illegal substance and walk back out.  That is not their purpose.  Their primary purpose is to save lives and their secondary purpose is to try to address the drug problem the individual has.  We will do that by providing all the ancillary services at the facility.  From my experience, if we have the right facility and services in place, we will not only save lives, we will save people from a lifetime of drug addiction.  If the facility is there that can actually provide the services when somebody is at their lowest point, they will grab it with both hands and take it.

A significant number of families have been housed or we have found homes for them.  There have also been significant numbers of families coming into homelessness.  The figure was 87 in the month of January.  The challenge is to reduce the numbers coming into homelessness and accelerate the numbers coming out.  We have an agreement with the CEOs of the four Dublin local authorities to try to share the responsibility here for transitioning families from hotel rooms into more suitable accommodation.  The majority of those will be into social housing, either through rapid build social housing, conventional social housing or social houses that have been purchased or brought back into use from voids.<\/p>  <p>  We will also be very proactively using the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, which was very successful last year.  There were approximately 800 homes found for individuals and families through the latter.  Some of the families will be in what we call family transition hubs on a temporary basis.  It is emergency accommodation specifically kitted out for families with homework clubs, facilities for children and much more normalised family-style facilities in terms of where people eat that are safe and clean and so on.  Respond! opened one in Drumcondra at the start of the year that can cater for 32 families.  It is quite a successful model.  We want to have that type of approach available for families so they can be looked after on a temporary basis while we find a transition for them into either long-term tenancies or social housing, which is ultimately the answer here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300031#DD01200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1487866500,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned the family transition homes.

I will have to get the figure for the split between the two but many were families.  If one looks at the figure for January, which was not a good figure overall in terms of homelessness and which people have commented on, the number of homeless adults has increased.  That was not a huge surprise to us considering that we put a lot of extra emergency beds into the system.  Those beds have been filled by and large so it is not surprising the numbers are up somewhat.  If one looks at the number homeless families, it is down by 33 and the number relating to dependants is down by 98.  We are making some progress there considering 87 families came into homelessness in that month.  The truth is that in the past number of months we have managed to stop the significant increase by taking a lot of people out of homelessness as quickly as possible.  We need to ensure that we slow down the numbers coming into homelessness and continue to increase the pace in which we can facilitate the transition out of emergency accommodation.  I am still confident we can do that by 1 July; I have always said it would be in the first half of this year and there will obviously be a difference.  That only gives us four months.

Rebuilding Ireland includes a range of actions that are targeted at assisting borrowers and ensuring that a range of suitable restructuring options is available that ultimately seeks to support borrowers to remain in their homes.  As part of those actions I have sought, through the review of the mortgage-to-rent scheme, to ensure that those households who have no realistic prospect of returning to solvency can be supported to remain in their homes in a secure social housing tenancy arrangement thereby avoiding additional pressures on the rental and social housing sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The review acknowledged that the current operating model, which relies on approved housing bodies to purchase individual properties, may not have the capacity to meet the needs of all borrowers who may be eligible for the scheme.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities that have come forward with an interest in working with the mortgage-to-rent scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The contractual and lease arrangements that are required to secure these units from a local authority perspective require detailed consideration and the questions the Deputy has asked need answers.  Overall, these pilot projects are in a developmental stage and my Department is working with the Housing Agency in this regard.  I will be in a better position to set out in more detail how the pilot projects will operate and how the private investors will be selected when this development work is complete. <\/p>  <p>  I have met a number of these organisations and most of them are not motivated by profit but they need a certain minimum rate of return to get funding and backing.  Essentially, instead of banks having to deal with individual properties and individual approved housing bodies and selling the properties one by one, the banks would cluster groups of properties that would qualify for the mortgage-to-rent scheme, the owners would also qualify under the new more flexible criteria and we would put together a financial package, which would mean that we could deal with 20, 30 or 50 cases at a time, which would be in the interests of the borrowers and the banks concerned.  The opportunity to deal with significant increased numbers will flow from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300032#EE00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1487867100,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Any of us who is keen to see greater solutions for those in mortgage distress will keep an open mind on this.  The first key issue is security of tenure.  As the Minister knows, under the current rules, if somebody mortgages to rent with an approved housing body, they effectively have a lifetime tenancy.  Will the same type of principle apply in these cases?  If we consider, say, a 20-year lease with a fund, even a long-term reputable investment fund, the difficulty is about what will happen at the end of the 20-year period.  There is also the issue of the financing because there is considerable financial support for the approved housing bodies, albeit not as much as they would like, both in terms of the 40% figure, essentially a grant deposit, as well as the &euro;15,000 grant for refurbishment.  If the involvement of funds involves an approved housing body and a fund, as one model is proposing, that has implications but if it just a fund that is going to purchase large volumes of distressed mortgages, does the Minister envisage those involved having the same access for the &euro;15,000 grant for repairs or, for example, something similar to the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS, payment to assist them with a deposit?  What is the current thinking on those issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300032#EE00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1487867100,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I have met a number of the organisations behind the funds to explore how this might work.  At least one of them is now an approved housing body as well.  The one in which David Hall is involved, for example, applied to become an approved housing body and it believes it can raise sufficient capital with very modest rates of returns.  The business model will be something along the lines that a local authority will agree to effectively lease a property under a normal leasing arrangement for 20 years with an option to renew after 20 years.  The security of tenure for people in these properties should be more or less the same as a normal social housing tenant in a long-term tenancy arrangement.  In the case of approved housing bodies that look to State to partially fund acquisitions, that is a slightly different model.  There is a third model whereby funds seek to invest in social housing, knowing that the State will give a guaranteed rent for a long time.  They will be looking for low levels of returns with very high security, which is a classic pension fund-type model.  We have asked the Housing Agency to work through these models with the different people and organisations concerned and then we will choose the ones we will deal with.  From my experience of the organisations we have met, they all have pretty altruistic motives in this respect..  This is not a vulture fund-type set-up; they are organisations that have been set up to try to improve and provide more social housing and to put in place a long-term funding arrangement to facilitate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300032#EE00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1487867100,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Certainly that is the case in respect of the business model David Hall and his associates have put in place.

As soon as some of that detail is available, the housing committee might be a good place to tease that out.  Many of us would like to support a good initiative that allows people to remain in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  There are two other questions in this respect.  The first relates to those people in mortgage distress who do not qualify for social housing support under the current legislation and whether the funds may provide an avenue for addressing their long-term housing needs.  In addition, the approximately 20,000 buy-to-let properties that are more than 90 days in arrears and which have tenants in them clearly will not benefit from this scheme.  Equally, however, if those tenants are in receipt of rent supplement, the local authorities cannot purchase those houses.

There are broader considerations potentially within Government and the Department of Finance on whether we extend those criteria.  There is an ongoing discussion as to whether, for example, we extend income thresholds around social housing eligibility and there are arguments for and against that.  What we have done, which is quite a significant change, is we have launched the Abhaile programme whereby homeowners and borrowers can now access, if they are in real difficulty, free legal assistance and free financial advice and assistance.  On top of that, for people who have no hope of being able to repay unsustainable loans, there is an obligation on banks to give a very good reason as to why they would not work with a mortgage-to-rent type system.  We have widened the eligibility criteria for that in terms of qualification of a property, in that a property with two spare bedrooms can qualify and the value of the property can also be higher but the eligibility criterion for the applicants must be that they qualify for social housing.  Otherwise, we get would get into the territory of moral hazard.  If we do not have some income limit, we will have people seeking to potentially stay in households when they may have unsustainable debt but also have an income level that could allow them to provide themselves with alterative accommodation without too much difficulty.  There are various issues to consider.  We have spoken to the Department of Finance about that but the core point is we are significantly expanding the mortgage-to-rent scheme and I hope it will result in a significant increase in numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300032#EE00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","time":1487867100,"counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300032#EE00650"},{"type":"question","time":1487867100,"counter":298,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[9430\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300032#EE00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the potential that refurbished or converted spaces above commercial properties in town and city centres have for increasing residential supply; and if he is considering making changes to the building control regulations to facilitate the use of these spaces.
