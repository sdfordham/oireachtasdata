I am confident that the development will enhance the potential of Killarney House as a top class visitor and heritage tourism centre.  It will do this in parallel with respecting its prime focus as a visitor centre for Killarney National Park and by developing its status as a heritage property managed by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 it was decided to pursue the opening of Killarney House and Gardens on a phased basis.  The House is being developed as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the National Park, highlighting the beauty and interpreting the richness and significance of the Park&rsquo;s landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna as well as telling the story of interaction with the Park over the centuries.  Some of the formal rooms are currently being restored to their former glory.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the original ornamental grounds and gardens immediately surrounding the House have been restored, creating spectacular landscaped areas that will merge into the natural areas of the Park and which will provide vistas linking the town to the scenery of mountain, woods and lakelands.

My Department, of course, cooperates fully with any Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies.  The main source of wild gorse fires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.\u00a0 Aside from such malicious activities, one of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, (including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land), to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our National Parks, Nature Reserves and Designated (Natura 2000) Sites.<\/p><p>With regard to the National Parks in particular, on an on-going basis, officials from my Department are in close liaison with both the Garda&iacute; and the Fire Service. My staff remain ever-vigilant when conditions exist that might result in fires in the National Parks.<\/p><p><i><\/i>Finally, Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts 1976, as amended, prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August.<\/p><p>Following a review of Section 40, which involved, inter alia, consideration of submissions from interested parties, I announced proposals in December 2015 to introduce legislation to allow for managed hedge cutting and burning at certain times within the existing closed period on a pilot two year basis.\u00a0 The legislation required to allow for these pilot measures is included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January 2016.<\/p><p>The Bill recently completed its passage through Seanad &Eacute;ireann and will now go to Dail &Eacute;ireann.\u00a0 In the meantime, the existing provisions relating to Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts remain in force.<\/p><p>My Department will liaise with the relevant services in the context of collating data on habitat destruction in recent illegal fires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200062#WRA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Concert Hall","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200062#WRA03250"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[20084\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200062#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans for the development of the National Concert Hall; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>The National Concert Hall in conjunction with the Office of Public Works is working on the preparation of a Master Plan which will, amongst other things, maximise the use of the historic site and ensure that the National Concert Hall is fit for purpose in the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century.

For the 2011 census there were two new questions and changes to eight other questions.

New questions, or changes to existing questions, must be tested in advance to ensure they will provide meaningful results and be well understood by the public.

This represents a significant improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.

This is done by using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001). Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. In line with best international practice, the valuation element of the rating system should have both a comprehensive revaluation and revision programme running in tandem.<\/p>  <p>  The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 150,000 commercial rateable properties. Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates. <\/p>  <p>  While the revaluation programme has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and, during 2016, some 3,297 applications for revision were processed. Also, any backlog of revision work is cleared during the revaluation of a local authority area. As already mentioned revision of valuation is the process by which the valuation lists are maintained between revaluations and reflects changes to property of a structural nature and the addition to the valuation lists of new properties. <\/p>  <p>  It has been a priority for the Valuation Office to enter into collaborative arrangements to ensure that an efficient and effective revision programme can be conducted on an ongoing basis with all Local Authorities. To this effect, the Commissioner has implemented a number of initiatives to enhance the capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver a high-quality and timely revision service.  During 2016, the Valuation Office&rsquo;s new approach based on more extensive data sharing was rolled out with all local authorities and online services have been enhanced to facilitate more effective data exchanges between those bodies and the Valuation Office.  <\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Office recently commissioned a review of its revaluation and revision processes which was jointly conducted by the Institute of Revenue Rating and Valuation (IRRV) and the International Property Tax Institute (IPTI). That review made a number of recommendations in line with best international practice and which are based on methodologies and processes for handling statutory valuation work in other jurisdictions. These recommendations will now form the basis of an implementation plan which is being put in place by the Valuation Office. The review also proposed, among other recommendations, the establishment of a separate, permanently resourced Revision Unit which would be responsible for the processing of revision work and the ongoing assessment of properties falling under this category.    <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that following the receipt of a business case from the Valuation Office seeking the provision of additional funding to allow for the establishment of a dedicated Unit to deal specifically with the ongoing revision programme, I was pleased to be in a position to announce as part of the budgetary provisions for 2017, the allocation of an additional &euro;750,000 to the Valuation Office for this purpose.  This development, which involves the appointment of a number of additional staff, in tandem with the rollout of improved online facilities and enhanced processes and procedures, is specifically intended to address backlogs in conducting revision assessments and to enable the Valuation Office to provide timely and high quality revision services to Local Authorities and ratepayers into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200064#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200064#WRC02350"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[20853\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200064#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the requirement for Afghan nationals applying for Irish visas (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the measures outlined are required to ensure, as far as possible, that the supporting documents of visa applicants are verified and authenticated.<\/p>  <p>  This is a normal function of the decision maker in any visa application process.

This is one the main statutory functions of the Commissioner of Valuation.  The revaluation programme is the first of its kind since the mid-nineteenth century and has been a policy objective of successive governments for several decades.  The programme has gained considerable momentum following the enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation, in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the costs incurred in the period 2005 to 2014 in respect of the revaluation programme was &euro;33 million.  The estimation of the costs incurred for 2015 and 2016 is of the order of &euro;8 million in total.  The estimated cost to date of the national revaluation programme is, therefore &euro;41 million.  I am advised that the estimated costs to date are apportioned on a pro-rata basis for the various work programmes undertaken by the Valuation Office, including ongoing statutory and non-statutory work carried out by the Office and that these estimates are derived from the overall expenditure incurred in running the Valuation Office, taking account of staffing and other relevant costs.  As the Deputy will be aware, the staffing costs of an organisation such as the Valuation Office would typically account for 75 - 80% of the total cost of running the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  In calculating the approximate costs associated with the REVAL 2017 phase of the programme, the estimation of costs for work completed for that project in 2016, including salary costs, is &euro;4.5 million.  The Deputy will be aware that the 2015 Act has enabled the Valuation Office to adopt a series of new approaches to revaluation not supported by the previous legislation, including the outsourcing of work, the use of \"self assessment\" principles known as \"Occupier Assisted Valuation\" and more extensive use of statistical analysis.  These are being piloted during the REVAL 2017 phase of the overall programme.  Accordingly, the costs for the period 2017 and 2018, to the anticipated completion of REVAL 2017, and the costs arising until the anticipated completion of the overall national revaluation programme in 2021, are likely to be significantly determined by the success or otherwise of these pilot projects and the Valuation Office is not in a position to provide an estimate of such costs until the outcome of these pilot projects is apparent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Closures","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[19249\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to reopen the Garda station in Bansha, County Tipperary; her plans for the building if it is not being reopened; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel and resources, including decisions in relation to Garda stations and I, as Minister, have no direct role in these matters. <\/p><p>I have asked the Garda Commissioner for the specific information requested and when it is to hand I will inform the Deputy accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[19253\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is adequately equipped and specifically skilled to carry out investigations into complex cases of fraud and has sufficient resources in place to deal with these types of cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the day to day operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including in relation to personnel and resources, and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I have asked the Garda Commissioner for the specific information requested and when it is to hand I will inform the Deputy accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[19254\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200065#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied that in the course of investigations into cases of fraud further instances of fraud uncovered are also being thoroughly examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This involved consultation with a representative group of residents, a number of residents volunteering to participate in live shopping expeditions, an examination of the household shopping basket for families and single persons, an examination of responses to questionnaires completed by all residents on the range and type of foodstuffs they would like to be made available and an analysis of the findings of the Safe Food Report 'What is the cost of a healthy food basket in the Republic of Ireland in 2016?'.  This analysis led to the allocation of a weekly number of points to each adult and child resident in the centre.  These points are then used to obtain fresh food and other products in the Food Hall.  As a result, parents are now able to cook food in their own accommodation for their own families.  The Food Hall is open six days a week and stock is replenished as required.  Ethnically appropriate foods and spices are also available.

It is for this reason, and on foot of the McMahon Report, that the Government sought to address this issue in the Programme for Government.

I am satisfied that this system will continue to meet the reasonable needs of residents and allow them to provide for their families.<\/p><p>Let us not forget that the introduction and implementation of this new system has been welcomed by residents and has already had a very positive impact on the atmosphere right through the centre.

The Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistleblowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure to GSOC, which is a statutorily independent body, for investigation.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation allows that an individual employed by a public body may also make a Protected Disclosure to the Minister with responsibility for that body.  It is the case that in a number of instances I have received such disclosures. It is important to note that in some cases the individuals concerned have indicated that they have already been in contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and\/or GSOC regarding the same matters.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Act came into effect I have received 8 complaints in which the Protected Disclosures Act has been cited.  These are from individuals who either are, or were, employees\/members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Of these, 6 were members or retired members and 2 were civilian or former civilian employees.  1 complaint was made in 2015, 3 in 2016 and 4 in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; or a civilian employee of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The process that applies in my Office to any such correspondence is as follows.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the correspondence is assessed to determine whether it constitutes a Protected Disclosure under the Act.  Secondly, consideration is given to what action is required.  The individual is then informed of what action I propose to take.  All reasonable efforts are taken to keep the identity of the individual concerned confidential. <\/p>  <p>  Actions taken can include seeking a Garda report from the Garda Commissioner (having first confirmed that the individual is agreeable to that course of action), referring matters to GSOC under powers available to me as Minister under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, referring matters to an external body or person for review, etc.  As the Deputy is aware two such Disclosures received in 2016 were reviewed by Mr Justice O&rsquo;Neill and a Tribunal of Inquiry has been established under Mr Justice Charleton.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the cases referred to above there have been a small number of other cases which did not specifically cite the Act, but might be inferred to have been Protected Disclosures.

Judge McCartan was appointed on 7 March 2017 and officially commenced his new role on 27 March.  The assessment process will be conducted completely independently of Government, and it is hoped that Judge McCartan can conclude his assessment process within 90 days.  The scope of the assessment process is outlined in the D&aacute;il Motion of 26 January 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Judge McCartan will be assisted by a Junior Counsel.  He will have discretion to afford the Stardust Relatives and Victims Committee whatever representation he believes is necessary in order for the Committee to present its evidence to the assessment process.  <\/p>  <p>  To facilitate the assessment process, office accommodation and meeting facilities have been obtained by the Department of Justice and Equality at the following address: Tom Johnson House (Beggars Bush), Haddington Road, Dublin 4.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017 there were 307 Garda assigned to the Kerry Garda Division of which 105 were assigned to the Killarney District.  There were also 7 Garda Reserves and 7 civilians attached to the Killarney District.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 16 of which were assigned to the Kerry Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200066#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Health","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200066#WRE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[19533\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200066#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of women in each of the years 2011 to 2016 who, upon receiving a custodial sentence and going to prison, have had entered on their medical record that due to pregnancy they require antenatal care; if there is an existing recording system for such data; and if she will set out a proposed timetable to remedy this.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[19534\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200066#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of pregnant women in prison nationally that required an escort from prison to the local maternity hospital in order to receive appropriate antenatal care\u00a0in each of the years 2011 to 2016; and if no records are kept of these escorted antenatal visits, the reason for this lack of record keeping and her plans to address it.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.<\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Irish Prison Service that prisoners be provided with healthcare services which are equivalent to those made available to citizens in the general community, including maternity care services.  <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has advised that the delivery of healthcare services to all persons in custody is on an individual patient basis.

Many courthouses have been improved since the establishment of the Courts Service but in a number of locations work remains to be done.  In some cases this involves building a new courthouse, in other cases it involves refurbishing and extending the existing courthouse.  In all cases it is dependant both on the availability of funding and on the Courts Service's ability to acquire a suitable site on which a new or extended courthouse can be built.  The site acquisition is often a lengthy and complex process as suitable sites are generally not readily available at the required location or at a price that provides value for money.<\/p>  <p>  Action No. 102 of the Action Plan for Rural Development provides for the construction or redevelopment of seven regional courthouses - with four new courthouses being built in Drogheda, Letterkenny, Limerick and Wexford and substantial refurbishment and extension of existing courthouses in Cork, Mullingar and Waterford.

A Register requesting public pledges went live onthe Irish Red Cross website (<i>www.redcross.ie<\/i>) in late September 2015 to collate offers of housing from the public.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, due to operational difficulties in Italy and Greece, the relocation programme was slow to commence all over the EU and significant numbers of asylum seekers did not begin to arrive in Ireland until late 2016.  Persons in the relocation programme must then have their application for asylum determined which takes around 12 weeks.  It has therefore only been in the last number of months that the numbers of refugees emerging from the relocation programme and available for settlement in communities around Ireland has reached significant numbers.  This number currently stands are 198 and is rapidly increasing.  Most of these refugees will receive accommodation in communities around Ireland through the long established resettlement model run in cooperation with the local authority and funded by my Department.  This model provides for a range of local supports including the appointment by the local authority of a resettlement worker\/s.  However, other refugees will also be offered pledged accommodation and services through the Irish Red Cross with the intention of assisting them to move more speedily out of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs) into local communities.<\/p><p>The first relocation group arrived in Ireland in January 2016.  Over the last 12 months the Department of Justice and Equality has been working closely with the Irish Red Cross and during this time the Irish Red Cross has been engaged in a programme of planning and coordination, learning valuable lessons from previous resettlement projects, through engagement with institutions, community groups and Red Cross Movement Partners implementing similar projects in the EU. <\/p><p>The<b><\/b>Irish Red Cross<b><\/b>as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has played an integral role providing a range of vital and lifesaving supports to millions of migrants along the migration trail from Syria, the Middle East and across Europe.  The emblem of the Red Cross is a familiar and trusted sign of humanity and impartiality to many migrants entering Ireland.  Almost without exception those who arrive in  Ireland under the relocation programme will have encountered members of the Red Cross\/Red Crescent movement on their journey to Ireland.  The role of the Irish Red Cross in providing support at the point of entry in Ireland, supporting resettlement, family tracing, day to day supports at local levels is fundamental to the success of welcoming and creating a sustainable and stable living environment for those seeking refuge. <\/p><p>The Irish Red Cross received just over 700 pledges of accommodation across 27 counties in Ireland.  Of this figure, the Irish Red Cross currently have 360 active shared accommodation offers, 120 active vacant stand-alone premises and 220 premises that are on hold, either not currently available or not meeting criteria.<\/p><p>The Irish Red Cross is researching formal processes to secure housing and are engaged in a rigorous housing assessments focusing on 120 vacant stand-alone pledges as part of Phase 1.  Individual property inspections have assessed the suitability and appropriateness of these premises against a number of safety and situational criteria.  Once a property is approved as suitable for housing, the Irish Red Cross are facilitating regulatory agreements with property owners and fitting out the properties to a minimum required standard.<\/p><p>The Irish Red Cross has been working closely with the IRPP and those who have received refugee status to understand the specific needs and requirements of families and individuals.  With this in mind, placing refugees in any accommodation must take into account a range of personal and social requirements to support connectedness with Irish societal systems for both refugees and local communities and to respect the wishes and cultural aspirations of refugees.  One of the significant challengers in terms of programme design is ensuring that the level of support available to those placed in pledged accommodation is broadly similar to that which pertains under the standard resettlement model.  In addition, many offers of pledged accommodation are time limited which means that refugees will need to move from their pledged accommodation at some point and be placed in alternative accommodation within the community.  This will require careful management to ensure that the ongoing needs of the refugees are met.  Currently<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>there are a number of families and individuals who have gained refugee status and of this number the Irish Red Cross are currently placing over 30 clients in pledged accommodation in May and have already placed three families in new homes.  The Irish Red Cross are continuing the wrapping around of social supports linking with official Ireland and encouraging participation and engagement with local communities. <\/p><p>The Irish Red Cross has been working with the IRPP in the rigorous development of the &lsquo;migration programme&rsquo; which has multidimensional outputs by managing the following activities:<\/p><p>-  Providing in-kind supports to Syrian families at the air side point of entry working alongside the IRPP and the International Organisation for Migration.  To date, the Irish Red Cross has provided supports to over 382 people arriving on flights into Ireland.<\/p><p>-  Providing support to migrants to secure medium to long term accommodation in Ireland under the pledged system and\/or private rental market.<\/p><p>-  Facilitating and connecting refugees with necessary social supports and services in Ireland and at community level. (Education, Health, Social Welfare, Employment, English Language Support).<\/p><p>-  Scaling up the Red Cross volunteer network at county level to support community integration activities; the Irish Red Cross is currently recruiting over 300 volunteers nationwide to support community level integration over the next 24 months and beyond.<\/p><p>-  Developing and carrying out training on cultural awareness issues and psycho-social supports. <\/p><p>-  Contributing as a member of Irish Refugee Protection Programme Task force - a cross-departmental and inter-agency Taskforce.<\/p><p>-  Supporting Family Reunification Travel Assistance and Restoring Family Links for 315 cases in 2015 and 257 cases in 2016.<\/p><p>-  Scaling up activities in preparation including holding informative regional meetings with its members, pledgers and local NGOs.<\/p><p>-  IRC is also engaging in dialogue with local authorities and department of housing discussing the possibilities of utilising Housing Assistance Programme (HAP).<\/p><p>I also understand that the Irish Red Cross is developing a Customer Relationship Management Service which supports the ability to collate all data on pledges and casework in a central location, protecting personal data.  The CRM system also supports accurate reporting enabling the service user, the Irish Red Cross and the IRPP to identify clear and concise outputs and indicators.<\/p><p>In 2015\/2016 the Irish Red Cross received a total of &euro;180,345 from my Department.  This year the amount made available will increase in order to scale up the placement of clients in pledged accommodation together with supporting services.  I anticipate that the amount made available for these purposes over the course of 2017 will be approximately &euro;500,000.  The purpose of the increased sum is to ensure the placement of larger numbers of refugees in pledged accommodation around the State in order to supplement the existing model of resettlement.  It is my intention that this model will be reviewed over the coming twelve months to see how the lessons learned can be applied more broadly, both operationally and in terms of future policy development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200067#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[19780\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200067#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if, in view of the supports provided to programme refugees resettled here, any comparable model of support is offered to persons granted permission to remain here following relocation from Greece or Italy; and if so, the detail of those supports.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017; 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) covers two distinct cohorts - relocation cases from Greece and Italy and resettlement cases from Lebanon - the Deputy's question refers in particular to the former, those arriving from Greece and Italy as relocated asylum seekers. <\/p>  <p>  The comprehensive reply to Parliamentary Question No. 96 of 21 February 2017 sets out in detail the nature of the integration programmes available to refugees arriving under the resettlement strand of the IRPP.  In relation to the relocation strand of the IRPP, I can inform the Deputy that the integration programmes available to the relocated asylum seekers arriving here will be broadly the same as those for programme refugees, but there may be some small differences arising from the different nature and initial entitlements of this cohort. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 96 of 21 February 2017, work in relation to the arrival of UNHCR programme refugees begins about 9 months in advance of resettlement.  With the relocation cohort this period of advance planning is not available because of the circumstances of the relocation group and the process set out in the relocation instruments.  Instead the IRPP has about 3 months to plan for the arrival of relocated asylum seekers.  When this cohort arrive they do not, as asylum seekers, possess the same rights and entitlements as refugees.  <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the IRPP endeavours to the greatest extent possible to treat families and individuals arriving under the relocation programme in a broadly equivalent manner so as to commence the integration process in the quickest possible time scale.  The IRPP does this as the likelihood of persons in this cohort achieving a grant of international protection is very high because (a) the selection process embedded in the relocation instruments is predicated on the fact that eligible nationalities must, across the EU, have a 75% or higher chance of obtaining status and (b) the overwhelming majority of persons being relocated to Ireland are fleeing the war in Syria. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of their arrival in Ireland, relocated asylum seekers will have been interviewed while in Greece or Italy by an IRPP team to assess their needs and vulnerabilities prior to arrival in Ireland and to initially orient them to Irish life and society.<\/p>  <p>  Following their arrival in Ireland, and during their initial period of reception, relocated asylum seekers will be accommodated in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).  As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently settled around the country.  In the EROC they will receive broadly the same integration services as available to programme refugees with due account being taken of the fact that certain things may not be able to happen until individuals receive a decision on their application for a grant of international protection.  This decision is usually forthcoming within twelve weeks.  IRPP staff meet individuals and families at regular intervals to help assess their ongoing needs and requirements. The client group also receive an orientation and language training programme while in the EROC.  A Friends of the Centre group has been established in Ballaghaderreen, the newest EROC to be opened and, working with the Irish Red Cross, the IRPP is liaising with volunteers to provide additional supports to facilitate residents as they start the long process of integrating into Irish society.  <\/p>  <p>  Some of the key features of supports provided to relocated asylum seekers include:<\/p>  <p>  -  IRPP staff and interpreters meet families and individuals upon arrival at Dublin Airport and accompany them to their Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre where they are accommodated for approximately six months.  <\/p>  <p>  -  During the days post arrival the asylum seekers are registered with the Department of Social Protection for a public services card and receive an exceptional needs payment (ENP).   -  IRPP officials provide assistance to ensure that families and individuals receive a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  -  IRPP liaise with the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme.<\/p>  <p>  -  Local Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to provide services, to provide information and to support and befriend the refugees.<\/p>  <p>  -  A GP is assigned to the relocated asylum seekers to ensure that their immediate medical needs are met including referral to dental and optical services. <\/p>  <p>  -  Childcare is  provided free of charge to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme in their EROC.<\/p>  <p>  -  Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  -  Emergency medical matters are followed up while resident in the EROCs.<\/p>  <p>  -  Once the asylum seekers receive refugee status and when housing is available, the refugees will be resettled in the community with the support of the IRPP and volunteers in the local community.  Each family will be assigned a resettlement worker to assist with the transition. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of settlement in the community, the overall model to be used will be identical to the model used for programme refugees as will be the suite of integration supports.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to integration, the Deputy may also be aware that the Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint for the Government's action to promote migrant integration for the period to 2020.  It sees integration as a two-way process which involves action by migrants and non-migrants alike.  It promotes action by Government, business, employers, migrants, NGOs and local communities.  The Strategy requires all Departments to insert integration as a theme in strategy statements, business plans and staff training.  It is using networks as a means of encouraging greater participation by migrants in all aspects of Irish life.  It includes targeted initiatives to promote migrant entrepreneurship, to encourage migrants into the Civil Service and onto State boards and to improve English language provision in education and training.  It is accompanied by a Communities Integration Fund which I launched on 7 February, which will provide funding for community initiatives to promote integration.<\/p>  <p>  The IRPP integration model for relocated asylum seekers will work with existing best practice in this areas as pioneered by the OPMI but is also willing to work organically with community bodies, NGOs and civil society to see what else can be added to the integration model in order to help refugees successfully integrate into Irish society and rebuild their lives.  It is my firm intention that the model of integration and support is one which will evolve and develop over the coming twelve months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200067#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions Redress Scheme","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200067#WRF01750"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[19781\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200067#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the payments due by religious orders to the various redress schemes; the steps taken to recoup moneys owed; when she expects outstanding payments to be completed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>I presume that the Deputy is specifically referring to the Magdalen Restorative Justice Ex-gratia Scheme which is administered in my Department and the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme which is administered in the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>In relation to the Magdalen Restorative Justice Ex-gratia Scheme, the position is that my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, met with the four religious congregations involved in June 2013.

Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is also accepted that such an offence is more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.  <\/p><p>With respect to legislation establishing hate crime as a specific and punishable crime, it is important that any legislation which is introduced will allow for effective prosecution of these type of offences.  <\/p><p>In the area of policing, the Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.

These officers combined with GRIDO play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.

At that time, my Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.<\/p>  <p>  In England and Wales, for example, difficulties arising in connection with high trees or hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person concerned would have to show that an easement existed and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and overhanging trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland indicates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort.  This is intended to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between adjoining property owners and ill-feeling in the local community.<\/p>  <p>  The Mediation Bill 2017, which is currently before the Oireachtas, does not deal directly with the issue of overhanging trees and high hedges.  It does, however, propose introduction of an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence legal proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.<\/p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness I should add that, under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, an owner or occupier of land is required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that trees, shrubs and hedges on land are not a hazard or potential hazard for a person using a public road.  The section also provides that where a tree, shrub or hedge is a hazard, or obstructs the safe use of a public road, a road authority may serve notice on the owner or occupier of the land requiring that action such as the felling, cutting or removal of the tree, hedge or shrub be taken within a stated period.  In addition, section 58 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 provides that a network operator may, after serving notice on the owner or occupier of the land, lop or cut any tree or shrub which obstructs or interferes with any physical infrastructure of the network operator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200068#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":339,"content":"<p>Question No. 161 answered with Question No. 120.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Provision","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200068#WRG00700"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[20121\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200068#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of a new courthouse in Tralee, County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that their objective is to provide improved court accommodation in Tralee which has been on its agenda for some time.

That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained police men and women are available for and utilised in operational areas.

The House will understand the need for sensitivity in respect of those who have suffered greatly as a result of that incident.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the truth of those allegations, insofar as they relate to any action or inaction on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should be established and there are ongoing processes, set out in law, to do just that.<\/p>  <p>  The concerns that had been raised with me were, in all cases, brought quickly to the attention of, and pursued with, the Garda Authorities in the context of the ongoing investigation and review processes into the events at Omeath and related matters.  I expect to receive a final report from the Garda Authorities addressing these matters when the investigation and review are completed.<\/p>  <p>  I was aware also that certain relevant matters had been brought to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  On 21 April 2017 the Ombudsman Commission indicated publicly that it had decided to initiate a public interest investigation into these matters in accordance with its statutory powers under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 2005-2015.  The Ombudsman Commission has indicated also that its public interest investigation will take place alongside the ongoing investigation of complaints made previously.  I understand that these investigations will encompass the issues that Deputies have raised in their Questions.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will agree it is essential that the Ombudsman Commission&rsquo;s investigations must be allowed to take their course in order that the truth or otherwise of allegations made can be established independently and in accordance with the law and, indeed, to identify anything that might be learned from those events.  In that context there are no plans to establish a further form of inquiry at this time.<\/p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate for me to go into the detail of allegations made, I would make the point that for obvious reasons of safety and security it has been the long-standing practice of my predecessors not to comment publicly on whether any person was or was not a Garda informant.  I do not propose to depart from that practice.<\/p>  <p>  The House will understand also that it is a fundamental aspect of our criminal justice system that decisions in relation to preferring charges in individual cases are solely a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who acts independently in doing so.

The key argument for recognition of Traveller ethnicity was that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely and symbolically important to Traveller pride and self-esteem and overcoming the legacy of economic marginalisation, discrimination and low self-esteem with which the Traveller community struggles.  This is not to ignore the real problems that Travellers face but this symbolic gesture will create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and the Government in together seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and an honest dialogue on these issues and challenges.  The historic statement by the Taoiseach is also a new beginning and the start of the work that we need to do as a society, in partnership with Travellers, to address the real and stark issues that face the Traveller community in areas such as health, employment, education and accommodation.  I will present my plans to address these issues in the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy which I will, in consultation with other Departments and Traveller and Roma representatives, finalise shortly.

The fundamental principles outlined in the guidelines particularly in relation to determination of the best interests of the child are to a significant extent incorporated in the Children and Family Relationships Act.<\/p><p>The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contains new provisions regarding the best interests of children in family law proceedings which have been in operation since 18 January 2016.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended by section 45 of the 2015 Act, provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in proceedings where the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with the new Part V of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 63 of the 2015 Act.  Part V, entitled &ldquo;<i>Best Interests of the Child<\/i>&rdquo;, contains two important sections.<\/p><p><i>-  Section 31<\/i>sets out an extensive list of factors and circumstances to be taken into account by a court when determining the best interests of a child.  These include the views of the child that are ascertainable (whether in accordance with section 32 or otherwise).  The court can ascertain the views of the child in person or through an expert.  Section 31(6) provides that in obtaining the ascertainable views of a child, the court shall facilitate the free expression by the child of those views and endeavour to ensure that any views expressed by the child are not expressed as a result of undue influence, and may make an order under section 32.<\/p><p><i>-  Section 32<\/i>of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 facilitates the hearing of the voice of the child by enabling the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.  These provisions allow the courts to take account of the evolving capacity of children and also give the courts the flexibility to ensure that all children&rsquo;s views can be heard.<\/p><p>In addition to the Children and Family Relationships Bill, the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 was published on 3 February 2017.  Section 23 of the Bill provides that children will have the opportunity to make their views known to the court where an order is sought on behalf of a child or relates in part to a child.  The court will also have the option of appointing an expert to assist the court to ascertain the views of the child.<\/p><p>In relation to <i>Guideline 38<\/i>- &ldquo;<i>Children should have access to free legal aid, under the same or more lenient conditions as adults.<\/i>&rdquo;<\/p><p>In Ireland, children cannot normally be a party to civil proceedings in their own name.  They must sue by their &ldquo;next friend&rdquo; and defend by their &ldquo;guardian ad litem&rdquo;.  In both cases this is a parent or other adult who consents to act in such capacity.  Regulation 5(6)(a) of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016 provides that where rules of court require that a person (such as a child) sues by their next friend or defend by their guardian ad litem, then the application for civil legal aid must be made by that person on behalf of the child.  Regulation 5(6)(b) requires that where a person is granted a legal aid certificate on behalf of another person, then the person applying for the certificate must sign an undertaking to pay to the Board any payment which a person granted legal aid in their own right would have to make.  However, Regulation 5(6)(e) provides that the Board can waive the requirements of Regulations 5(6)(a)-(d) where it thinks it appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>The Legal Aid Board can and does provide services to children in their own right in circumstances where it is appropriate to do so (for example, to an unaccompanied child seeking international protection in the State).  While civil legal aid in Ireland is not free, the Board would consider an application for a waiver of the contribution from a child who is being provided services in their own right.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is currently working on legislation to reform current Guardian ad litem arrangements.  Further information regarding these reform proposals can be provided by Minister Zappone.<\/p><p>In relation to <i>Guideline 39<\/i>- &ldquo;<i>Lawyers representing children should be trained in and knowledgeable on children&rsquo;s rights and related issues, receive ongoing and indepth training and be capable of communicating with children at their level of understanding.<\/i>&rdquo;<\/p><p>Over 80% of the work the Legal Aid Board does is in the field of family law.  In that respect, Legal Aid Board solicitors are knowledgeable in the field of family law including child care law.  The Board provides continuing professional development for its solicitors including an annual conference which normally is on a family or child care law issue.<\/p><p>In relation to <i>Guideline 43<\/i>- &ldquo;<i>Adequate representation and the right to be represented independently from the parents should be guaranteed, especially in proceedings where the parents, members of the family or caregivers are the alleged offenders.<\/i>&rdquo;<\/p><p>In respect of child care proceedings, the Legal Aid Board normally provides representation to parents who are Respondents to such proceedings.  It is not normal for a child to be a party to such proceedings.  However, in circumstances where this is the case they will be separately represented and in such cases representation will be paid for by the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) rather than the Board.<\/p><p>Insofar as the guidelines are concerned with respecting and protecting the rights of children coming into contact with the criminal justice system and its adaptation to the specific needs and treatment of children while in that system, specific legal provision for these children is made in the Children Act 2001 (as amended).  The Act establishes a separate legal framework for dealing with young offenders incorporating principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over children by the courts.  These include, inter alia, the principles that children have rights and freedom before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults, in particular, a right to be heard and to participate in any proceedings of the court that can affect them; that any penalty imposed on a child for an offence should cause as little interference as possible with the child's legitimate activities and pursuits; that any penalty should take the form most likely to maintain and promote the development of the child and should take the least restrictive form that is appropriate in the circumstances; and that a period of detention should be imposed only as a measure of last resort.<\/p><p>I am delighted to say that on 6 April 2017, I signed three legal instruments under the Prisons Act, 2015.  The effect of these three Orders was to close down St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and subsume the only remaining wing of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s building &ndash; &lsquo;B&rsquo; wing - into Mountjoy Prison, all with effect from 7 April 2017.  The signing of these orders follows the making of orders by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Minister Katherine Zappone, T.D., which allows for the committal of newly sentenced 17 year old children directly to Oberstown Children Detention Campus with effect from 31 March, 2017.  Previously, responsibility for 16 year old boys was transferred from the Irish Prison Service to the children detention facilities at Oberstown in May 2012 and responsibility for all 17-year-old male remands was transferred in March 2015.  The overall effect of these recent legal instruments by both Ministers is that (i) from 31 March, 2017 no further new committals of children could be made by the Courts to the adult prison system and (ii) that on 7 April, 2017, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution was fully closed down, subsumed into Mountjoy Prison and no longer has a legal existence of its own.<\/p><p>Ending the practice of sending children to the adult prison system was a long standing Government commitment and was a key commitment in the programme for Government 2011-2016.  St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution has been the subject of much criticism by various bodies and persons involved in the area of human rights and children&rsquo;s rights.  The signing of these orders has consigned the name of St Patrick's Institution to the history books and is a significant and progressive step forward in the treatment of children in Ireland.<\/p><p>In addition, under the framework of the Inter-governmental Agreement on Cooperation in Criminal Justice Matters, the Youth Justice Services in Ireland and Northern Ireland meet on a regular basis to exchange information on experiences and best practice on a range of youth justice issues.  Such activity is encouraged by Part V of the CoE Guidelines.<\/p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 (as amended) also makes provision for children to make complaints in their own right without the requirement for the consent of a parent.  I am informed that in this way children can access the police complaints system independently.  Thereafter GSOC&rsquo;s interaction with children is governed by its Child Welfare and Protection Policy.  GSOC have trained specialist interviewers who are deployed as appropriate to take statements from and conduct investigations into complaints made by children.

The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200070#WRJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200070#WRJ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[20819\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200070#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons moved out of direct provision in each of the past ten years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>It is not obligatory for protection applicants to accept accommodation provided by the State and it is not obligatory for them to remain in such accommodation.<\/p><p>The database where information on accommodation is held is a dynamic one and provides a snapshot of total numbers in accommodation at any one time.

In accordance with the Directive, defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within particular categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower VAT rate or an exemption from VAT.  The supply of a defibrillator is not included in any of those categories of goods and therefore there is no discretion for Ireland to remove VAT from that supply.<\/p>  <p>  The VAT (Refund of Tax) (No.15) Order, 1981 provides that individuals can obtain repayment of VAT expended on certain goods and appliances which assist persons with a disability to overcome that disability.

As announced in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement, it is proposed to retain some of the unused fiscal space in 2019, following the achievement of the medium-term budgetary objective in 2018, as a contingency reserve.  If it is not deployed in the event of unanticipated adverse shock to the economy, it will be remitted to the rainy day fund.  Work is underway on a consultation document to be circulated to the Oireachtas on the proposed operation of the fund and the specific circumstances under which it could be deployed.<\/p>  <p>  Hypothecation involves linking specific expenditure to an explicit revenue source.  It is only used in limited circumstances where there is a strong justification because it can cause difficulties for the efficient and effective management of the public finances.  Furthermore, it also exposes specific expenditure dependent solely on a hypothecated revenue to any volatility associated with the revenue source in question.    <\/p>  <p>  As regards smoothing annual revenues, I assume that the Deputy is suggesting that revenue deemed to be in excess of a set level is paid from the Exchequer into a designated fund and subsequently drawn down from the fund when the revenue falls below the set level in order to maintain expenditure levels.  <\/p>  <p>  The basic premise behind the Deputy&rsquo;s question, that cyclical or windfall revenue should not be spent, is one that the Government agrees with as evidenced by its commitment to comply with the fiscal rules.  Under the rules, future permitted expenditure levels are driven by existing expenditure levels and the trend growth rate of the economy.  To increase expenditure above the permitted level, discretionary revenue measures, usually tax increases, must be introduced.  This is designed to ensure that increases in public expenditure are sustainably financed and it will reduce the danger that additional expenditure is being funded on the back of cyclical or windfall revenues.<\/p>  <p>  The second part of the equation is that cyclical or windfall revenues from corporation tax, or, potentially, other taxes, should be held in a vehicle to be used to fund general expenditure, if and when revenues drop.  <\/p>  <p>  Consideration of this would need to reach a view on the appropriateness of holding such money in a vehicle or fund when our general government debt is very high in nominal terms, at over &euro;200 billion.  While such a fund would reduce our net debt, it would keep our gross debt at a high level and there would be, in all likelihood, a carry cost to bear.  Furthermore, reducing our gross debt will increase our fiscal headroom or borrowing capacity that could be needed in the event of a future crisis and the reduction in gross debt would also reduce our annual interest bill.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that money transferred to such a fund from the Exchequer would not qualify as expenditure in statistical terms.  It would only be when the money is transferred back to the Exchequer and spent that it would impact the general government balance.  Unfortunately, the statistical system does not reward funding expenditure by savings put aside in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  The key difference between the rainy day fund and the type of vehicle referred to in the question is that the rainy day fund could only be used to fund expenditure in certain specified circumstances and not as a general funding source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200071#WRK04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Investigations","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200071#WRK04900"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[19309\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200071#WRK05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of private investigation firms hired by the Revenue Commissioners in the past five years to date; the names of the firms; the amount they were paid; if they supplied the Revenue Commissioners with a report on completion of their work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that they have not hired any investigation firms in the past five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200071#WRK05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Control Measures","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[19339\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider the recommendation in Tobacco Free Ireland to introduce a levy on the tobacco industry; the discussions his Department has had with the Department of Health on this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[19340\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has undertaken research on the recommendation in Tobacco Free Ireland to introduce a levy on the tobacco industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 232 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the proposal to introduce a levy on the tobacco industry which was included as a recommendation in the Department of Health's Tobacco Free Ireland.  The proposal was included in my Department's Tax Strategy Group papers of 2015 which form a basis for the discussions of the Tax Strategy Group.  As discussed in that paper, a levy of this type, on presumably the profits of tobacco companies, is not without complications and may have impacts on other areas of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, profits of companies are taxed through corporation tax.  To levy the profits of tobacco companies would complicate this. Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5% on trading income is akin to a brand and is an important part of the Government's strategy of creating an enterprise friendly environment to attract jobs and investment to Ireland. One of the main features of the rate is its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base.  The suggested levy would involve complexity and could undermine the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax offering.<\/p>  <p>  When a tobacco industry levy was proposed in the UK in 2015, the British Treasury concluded, on foot of a public consultation, that the impact of a tobacco industry levy would be passed on to the consumer.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Summer Budget 2015 that he would not be pursuing the proposal.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, this Government is committed to making Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  The Government has agreed that pricing is a key means of reducing tobacco consumption.  I have increased the price on a packet of cigarettes cumulatively by &euro;1.40 over my last three budgets, raising revenue and contributing to the continued decline of smoking prevalence.  Ireland continues to impose excise duty on tobacco which is among the highest in the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Data","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL00600"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[19364\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if, in view of the potential sale on part of the State investment in a bank (details supplied), his Department has made an assessment on possible future dividends from the bank over any time period; and if so, the results of such an assessment.","asker":"1222","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[19381\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has made an assessment on possible future dividends from a bank (details supplied) over any time period in view of the potential sale on part of the State investment in the bank; and if so, if he will provide the results such assessment to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.","asker":"1222","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 238 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the payment of any dividend is exclusively a matter for the board and management of AIB based on the bank&rsquo;s financial performance and future prospects, and subject to regulatory approval. <\/p>  <p>  AIB announced a proposed dividend payment of &euro;250m to ordinary shareholders as part of their annual results for 2016, 99.9% of which will accrue to the State as the Bank&rsquo;s majority shareholder.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, while I am aware of the difficulties faced by the hotel sector, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide cover or to price at a particular level.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance.  Accordingly, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  This Working Group is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short, medium and long-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.<\/p><p>The Working Group is now in its second phase which is concentrating on the Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance sectors.

My Department has received a number of such proposals from both the Irish League of Credit Unions  (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA).  Proposals from both representative bodies, in relation to the funding of social housing, are at various stages of development.  While the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing, any such proposal would require approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank before it could be implemented.<\/p><p><b>Social Housing Funding<\/b><\/p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that it has received information regarding proposals for credit unions to provide funding for social housing and is currently engaging with the sector on those proposals.  It further stated that while it does not comment on specific proposals, such investments could be facilitated by future regulations made by the Central Bank, where appropriate.  The Central Bank also stated that it is willing to consider the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals.  However, the Central Bank's key consideration in evaluating such proposals is its statutory mandate to ensure the protection of members' savings by credit unions and to ensure the wellbeing of the sector generally.<\/p><p>Officials from both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have met with the representative bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.  Officials from both Departments have also met with the Central Bank.  Separately, communication is ongoing between the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and my Department.<\/p><p>On 1 January 2016, I commenced the final sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) following discussions with credit union representative bodies.  Following commencement of the legislation, the Central Bank introduced the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016, regarding a number of areas including savings, borrowing, lending, investments and liquidity.<\/p><p>Investment regulations made specific reference to section 43 of the Act and to further classes of investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.  The regulations provide that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.  The Central Bank are currently reviewing the investment regulations for credit unions and on completion of their review will undertake a public consultation in 2017.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding any potential changes that may be made to the regulations, the legislative requirement for credit unions to ensure investments do not involve undue risk to members' savings will remain the overriding factor which must inform all credit union investment decisions.<\/p><p><b>SME Lending<\/b><\/p><p>In relation to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the  Central Bank has informed me that credit unions are permitted to provide commercial loans to their members.  Commercial loans are subject to concentration, maturity and large exposure limits as outlined in the 2016 Regulations.  In addition, where a credit union is considering granting a commercial loan, a comprehensive business plan and detailed financial projections (supported by evidence based assumptions), appropriate for the scale and complexity of the loan, should be provided and in place before such a loan is granted.  This should enable the credit union to ensure that it is satisfied that the borrowing business has the capacity to generate sufficient income to repay the commercial loan.  The Central Bank has further informed me that lending to SMEs is a specialist form of lending that requires specific skills and expertise. In general, this type of lending is viewed as high risk which may not be appropriate for all credit unions. <\/p><p><b>Mortgages<\/b><\/p><p>Currently credit unions can and some do provide mortgages to members.  These types of loans are subject to certain maturity limits contained in the 2016 Regulations.  The 2016 Regulations set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five years and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member. Under the 2016 Regulations credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).  Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.  There are currently 12 credit unions approved to avail of increased longer term lending limits.<\/p><p>The Central Bank informs me that the December 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall, total gross loans over 10 years amount to c. 2.7% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10% (and in some cases 15%).  <\/p><p>The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer term lending, including mortgages, being part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in their analyses, credit unions need to consider the impact of longer term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure &ndash; the issue of funding longer term lending with short term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.  The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidenced based business case. <\/p><p>The Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) recent report makes a number of recommendations, one of which is to conduct a full review of lending limits and concentration limits.  I have established an Implementation Group which to date has met on three occasions  and  is currently assessing each of CUAC's recommendations with a view to implementation as appropriate.  Central to its work is ensuring a full examination of lending limits and concentration limits is carried out as recommended.  I look forward to regular progress reports from the Implementation Group as these recommendations are developed and implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":573,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL04400"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[19588\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the availability of agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax, in which the farming land that is the subject of the relief has an already commissioned solar farm or is wholly or partially the subject of an unexercised option in favour of a solar farm developer or the subject of a burden in the Land Registry prohibiting the alienation or transfer of the landholding without the consent of a solar farm developer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that gifts and inheritances of agricultural property, including land, qualify for relief (known as 'agricultural relief') from the payment of Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) once certain conditions are satisfied.  Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.<\/p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date.  Revenue takes the view that land on which solar panels are installed is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test.  Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by solar panels (and not merely subject to an option over the land), the use of agricultural land for a solar farm may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief. <\/p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance.  It is unlikely that the ability to farm the land would be affected by the granting of an option over the land to a solar farm developer or the registration of a burden over the land with the Land Registry.  However, the ability to farm the land would be affected where the option is exercised by the solar farm developer and solar panels are actually installed.  As it would not generally be possible to farm any part of the land occupied by solar panels, the change in the use of land from farming to the generation of solar energy within the required 6-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.<\/p>  <p>  I would however inform the Deputy that arising out of a commitment I made in the D&aacute;il during the Report Stage of Finance Act 2016, an interdepartmental group has been established, which is currently examining the treatment for tax purposes of farmland on which solar panels are installed. <\/p>  <p>  I expect that group to report to me in due course with its recommendations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL04700"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[19595\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the whistleblower procedures for banks and other financial institutions are sufficiently strong and that they give adequate protection to whistleblowers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":578,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[19596\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of whistleblowers' allegations currently being examined by the Central Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[19597\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200072#WRL05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Central Bank has considered re-examining historic evidence and allegations from whistleblowers in view of the new legal and ethical rules in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 to 249, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  New protections for persons making protected disclosures to the Central Bank came into force on 1 August 2013.

These dates are used for different purposes and are mutually exclusive.  Firstly, the date of a gift or, in the case of an inheritance, the date of the death of a disponer, is the date by reference to which the CAT Group Thresholds and tax rates are determined.  Secondly, the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo;, i.e. the date on which the market value of the assets\/property comprising the gift or inheritance is established, is generally the date of the gift or, in the case of an inheritance, is generally the date on which probate or administration is granted.  This market value is then compared to the relevant Group Threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold.  This date also determines when any gift or inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Where the valuation date for a gift or an inheritance is in the period 1 January to 31 August, a CAT return and payment of CAT due must be made by 31 October in that year.  Where the valuation date for a gift or an inheritance is in the period 1 September and 31 December, a CAT return and payment of CAT due must be made by 31 October in the following year.<\/p>  <p>  Where a CAT liability is attributable to a gift or an inheritance of &lsquo;real&rsquo; property such as land and\/or buildings, a beneficiary has a statutory entitlement to pay this liability by monthly instalments over a period of up to five years.  Instalments are subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8% on the amount of the outstanding tax.  However, Revenue has the discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period of time in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship.  In cases of hardship, Revenue also has the discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue may also exercise discretion in relation to any property or assets by allowing the payment of CAT over a longer instalment period than the statutory five-year period allowed for &lsquo;real&rsquo; property.  This discretion can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances where the taxpayer can show that payment of the CAT liability by the due date would present significant difficulty.  Interest is chargeable on any such late payment. Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the inheritance involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00600"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[19677\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if changes have been made to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 (SI 353 of 1994), as amended, to confine the definition of a \"family member\" to that which is used for capital acquisitions tax law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1334","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[19678\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason an application under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 by a person (details supplied) has been refused; the basis within SI 353 of 1994 for this refusal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1334","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 253 together.<\/p>  <p>  There have been no changes made to the Drivers\/Passengers with Disabilities Scheme.

The CAP was established to hear appeals from all other impacted customers.  <\/p><p>&quot;The members of the panels include senior independent representatives from the legal and accountancy professions.  Members were proposed by Permanent TSB and the Central Bank was informed of the identities of the individual members prior to their appointments.  The panels are serviced by a secretariat which is itself independent of the bank.<\/p><p>&quot;Customers bringing an appeal to either of these panels incur no charges for doing so from either Permanent TSB or from the panels themselves.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals.<\/p><p>I am advised that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  These terms can include the driving experience of the driver, as well as the type and age of car, the age, claims record and penalty points of the driver, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market. In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  <\/p><p>However, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation. <\/p><p>My attention has been drawn to the difficulties faced by drivers who have spent time abroad and subsequently lose recognition for previous driving experience.  In order to tackle this issue, the Report recommends that a standard protocol be put in place for insurance companies in order to ensure a greater consistency of treatment for returning emigrants.  By the second quarter of this year, insurers are to implement policies to accept driver experience from abroad when a person has previous driving experience in Ireland and is coming from a country that drives on the left side of the road (e.g. UK), and take full account of the experience in that country and previous relevant Irish experience when pricing policy.  By the end of the year, this protocol is to be extended to take appropriate account of driving experience gained in countries which drive on the right hand side of the road.  My Department is working with Insurance Ireland to ensure that these actions are implemented by the deadlines set down in the Report.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy should note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

The Government is clear that any manifestation of a hard border would have very negative consequences.

Based on this analysis, such an increase would lead to Irish output being 1.3 per cent below the &ldquo;no interest rate change\" baseline forecast by 2018 and unemployment being 0.3 percentage points higher than baseline over the same time horizon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM03700"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[19909\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners publish the figures for uncollected income tax for each previous year and the total amount written off to date by each year; if so, the location this information can be found; if it is subject to audit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1263","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>The total amounts of tax written out each year are documented in Revenue&rsquo;s Annual Report.

These dates are used for different purposes and are mutually exclusive.  Firstly, the date of a gift or, in the case of an inheritance, the date of the death of a disponer, is the date by reference to which the CAT Group Thresholds and tax rates are determined.  Secondly, the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo;, i.e. the date on which the market value of the assets\/property comprising the gift or inheritance is established, is generally the date of the gift or, in the case of an inheritance, is generally the date on which probate or administration is granted.  This market value is then compared to the relevant Group Threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold.  This date also determines when any gift or inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Where the valuation date for a gift or an inheritance is in the period 1 January to 31 August, a CAT return and payment of CAT due must be made by 31 October in that year.  Where the valuation date for a gift or an inheritance is in the period 1 September and 31 December, a CAT return and payment of CAT due must be made by 31 October in the following year.<\/p>  <p>  Where a CAT liability is attributable to a gift or an inheritance of &lsquo;real&rsquo; property such as land and\/or buildings, a beneficiary has a statutory entitlement to pay this liability by monthly instalments over a period of up to five years.  Instalments are subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8% on the amount of the outstanding tax.  However, Revenue has the discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period of time in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship.  In cases of hardship, Revenue also has the discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue may also exercise discretion in relation to any property or assets by allowing the payment of CAT over a longer instalment period than the statutory five-year period allowed for &lsquo;real&rsquo; property.  This discretion can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances where the taxpayer can show that payment of the CAT liability by the due date would present significant difficulty.  Interest is chargeable on any such late payment. Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the inheritance involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00600"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[19677\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if changes have been made to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 (SI 353 of 1994), as amended, to confine the definition of a \"family member\" to that which is used for capital acquisitions tax law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1334","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[19678\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200073#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason an application under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 by a person (details supplied) has been refused; the basis within SI 353 of 1994 for this refusal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1334","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":637,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 253 together.<\/p>  <p>  There have been no changes made to the Drivers\/Passengers with Disabilities Scheme.

The CAP was established to hear appeals from all other impacted customers.  <\/p><p>&quot;The members of the panels include senior independent representatives from the legal and accountancy professions.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals.<\/p><p>I am advised that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  These terms can include the driving experience of the driver, as well as the type and age of car, the age, claims record and penalty points of the driver, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.

Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.

In order to tackle this issue, the Report recommends that a standard protocol be put in place for insurance companies in order to ensure a greater consistency of treatment for returning emigrants.  By the second quarter of this year, insurers are to implement policies to accept driver experience from abroad when a person has previous driving experience in Ireland and is coming from a country that drives on the left side of the road (e.g. UK), and take full account of the experience in that country and previous relevant Irish experience when pricing policy.  By the end of the year, this protocol is to be extended to take appropriate account of driving experience gained in countries which drive on the right hand side of the road.

The increase in the cost of insurance is a major concern for the Government and as a result, the implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Cost of Motor Insurance is a priority for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200074#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Assets Sale","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200074#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[20055\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200074#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the sales process engaged in by NAMA\u00a0in respect of Project Nantes; if the process was an open and competitive process; the number of bidders or potential bidders that were involved in different stages in the process; if a restricted number of parties were invited to make offers; the actual number of parties that were invited to make a bid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[20056\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200074#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the sales process engaged in by NAMA\u00a0in respect of Project Aspen; if the process was an open and competitive process; the number of bidders or potential bidders that were involved in different stages in the process; if a restricted number of parties were invited to make offers; the actual number of parties that were invited to make a bid; and if vendor financing was provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":675,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 and 272 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Section 9 of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA is independent in the performance of its functions and that, under Section 10 of the Act, its primary objective is to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State from its acquired loan portfolio.  In this regard, I am advised that NAMA is confident it upheld its mandate on both of these transactions.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that the marketing process for the Project Aspen loan portfolio began in January 2013 when NAMA&rsquo;s loan sale adviser, Eastdil Secured, approached some 90 prospective investors.  29 prospective investors signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and were provided with access to due diligence material relating to the portfolio.  I am advised that 14 investors submitted first round offers by the deadline of 25 February 2013.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that NAMA, acting on the advice of its loan sale adviser, agreed that the top three credible bidders be invited to a second round of bidding and that they be provided with access to a detailed electronic data room.  I am advised by NAMA that two of the short-listed bidders submitted second round offers by the deadline of 2 April 2013 and that, on the advice of its loan sale adviser, NAMA entered into exclusive discussions with Starwood Capital Group which had submitted the highest bid after an open, transparent and competitive sales process.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that, on 2 May 2013, NAMA and Starwood Capital Group announced a joint venture relating to the sale of the Project Aspen portfolio.  Under the terms of the agreement, NAMA sold the loan portfolio to the new joint venture entity, which was 20% owned by NAMA and 80% owned by a consortium led by Starwood.  I am further advised that NAMA provided a senior secured loan (vendor finance) to the joint venture with an initial loan to value of less than 60%.  The loan carried a commercial rate of interest and has since been repaid. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's almost identical question on Project Nantes, I am advised that this transaction was in fact a debt refinancing transaction.

Given that, I agreed with the NAMA Board in the context of NAMA's accelerated senior debt redemption target and its ancillary residential and commercial development funding activities, that a redundancy programme reflecting public sector norms and also comprising a retention payment element would be introduced to enable NAMA to retain key staff.<\/p><p>Retention payments are only made where staff are departing the organisation under the Agency's redundancy programme.\u00a0 The retention payment for individual staff is dependent on NAMA achieving its targets and on satisfactory individual performance ratings. \u00a0Redundancy dates are not &quot;voluntary&quot; in the ordinary sense as such dates are pre-agreed with staff as part of NAMA's wind down strategy. \u00a0Payment will only be made if the staff member was retained and did not leave the organisation until the pre-agreed date.<\/p><p>I am advised by NAMA that since the redundancy and retention scheme was approved by the NAMA Board in late 2015, a total of 91 members of staff assigned to NAMA have been approved for the scheme. <\/p><p>As\u00a0set out in previous responses to the D&aacute;il, most recently D&aacute;il Question 131 of 31 January 2017, the redundancy element is in keeping with established public sector norms; that is, two weeks statutory pay per year of service, capped at &euro;600 per week, plus three additional weeks of base salary per year of service with an overall cap of two years base salary.\u00a0 <\/p><p>NAMA has also advised that the retention portion of the scheme is being implemented in line with the stipulated parameters, which I agreed with the NAMA Chairman in March 2015, regarding the quantum of any payment under the scheme, the timing of any such payment and employee eligibility under the scheme.

In line with this undertaking, section 56 of the Finance Act 2016 provides that, as and from following the voluntary disclosure deadline date, the making of a qualifying disclosure will not be permitted where the tax liabilities involved relate to offshore matters.  These matters include accounts held, property situated in, or income or gains arising or accruing in, a country or territory other than the State.

Transitional rules for the period 2015-2018 provide that the Member State of registration may retain a percentage of the VAT collected for other Member States, with the retention percentage being 30% in 2015 and 2016 and 15% for 2017 and 2018.  Therefore the final retention fee payment in respect to VAT retained by Ireland from VAT revenues collected in respect of supplies to other Member States through the MOSS system for 2018 will be received in Quarter 1 2019.<\/p><p>Regarding Question 20237-17, I am informed by Revenue that the amount of VAT received between January and March 2017 in respect of electronic services provided to customers resident in other EU Member States is provided in the table.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As the majority of MOSS returns and payments are received on a quarterly basis in the following month where the quarterly period has ended, the amounts collected under the MOSS system in April 2017 is not available at this time. <\/p><p>The total VAT collected by Revenue on behalf of other Member States in respect of supplies to the MOSS system is not included in the Exchequer Returns as Ireland is only entitled to retain a percentage of this VAT according to the EU VAT rules. Ireland&rsquo;s retention fee for Quarter 1 2017 will be included in the Exchequer Returns for May 2017.<\/p><p>As regards Question 20238-17, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is difficult to reliably estimate the amount of VAT retained by Ireland for 2017 and 2018 because business models can change and businesses can opt out of the MOSS system and register for VAT locally in other Member States.  Based on trends so far this year, the amount retained by Ireland could be around &euro;240 million in 2017.  However, it is too soon to know whether this pattern will continue.<table><tr><th>Month<\/th><th>Country<\/th><th>Amount Received (&euro;m)<\/th><th>Amount Retained (&euro;m)<\/th><th>Amount Due

Ulster Bank is closing a significant number of branches with considerable negative impacts on both staff and customers alike.\u00a0 As you would be aware redundancies are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.\u00a0 I fully appreciate that the decision taken by the bank will be keenly felt in the locations concerned, both by staff and customers.  It is my understanding that the bank has been consulting with staff representatives and hopes that the necessary staff reductions can be achieved on a voluntary basis by agreement.  I would urge both sides to work together to achieve agreement and to utilise the resources of the State industrial relations apparatus to do this if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  However, I should stress that the Irish Government has no formal role in the commercial decisions of Ulster Bank, or any other bank, as to their future business model.  This is a matter for the Board and Management of a bank itself. <\/p>  <p>  The recent Ulster Bank closures are a response to\u00a0changing\u00a0ways of banking\u00a0due to less use\u00a0of cash,\u00a0increased use of technology and corresponding reduced visits to branches.  That said, I\u00a0expect that Ulster Bank will do everything that it can to mitigate the impacts of these branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.\u00a0 I also expect that the bank will ensure that customers are kept informed about developments and provided with the appropriate assistance to move branches, switch to other banks and avail of alternative means of accessing financial services.  The Central Bank will also have a role in ensuring that consumer protection rules are followed.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that in all locations Ulster Bank are committed to working with the local community to ensure a service is maintained.\u00a0 The bank has proposed how it will deal with continuity of service for its customers and this information will be made available to relevant customers.\u00a0 In addition, I understand that the Bank is willing to talk to local representatives about any concerns they might have.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services.  It is vital that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit and that they continually assess their options to ensure that they are getting the best value and service possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200074#WRN04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration","counter":700,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200074#WRN04500"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[20491\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200074#WRN04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an exemption from VRT charges for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":702,"content":"<p>The\u00a0relief from the payment of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is provided for under the Finance Act 1992, s.134(1)(a) and Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent Reliefs) Regulations 1993, Reg 4, (S.I.

As a consequence of the financial crisis, there was a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure so as to stabilise the country's public finances.  A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.<\/p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.<\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.

In schools, the Croke Park hours are 36 additional hours a year at primary (33 hours\u00a0at post-primary)\u00a0worked by teachers.  They are a valuable resource within the school system which allow certain essential activities involving the entire teaching staff or groups of teachers to take place.  These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.<\/p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer.  Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed with TUI and INTO to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies, is now under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgment, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.<\/p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.  The original Croke Park Agreement provided that all Croke Park hours (36 for primary and 33 for post-primary annually) would be worked on a whole-school basis.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided that up to 5 of the hours could be worked on a less than whole-school basis (e.g. small groups of subject teachers).  The recent agreement increases this maximum to 8 hours in September 2016 and 10 hours in September 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200075#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National

It is charged with, and is accountable for, the effective regulation of pharmacy services in Ireland, including responsibility for supervising compliance with the Act.  The PSI is responsible for defining and ensuring the standards of education and training for pharmacists qualifying in Ireland.  This includes developing standards, policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.<\/p>  <p>  The changes in the\u00a0degree programme structure arise from\u00a0the recommendations of the Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Reviews project and implementation\u00a0has been overseen by the National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Education and Training) (Integrated Course) Rules were signed by the Minister for Health in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  These Rules underpin the implementation of the new five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy which evolved from significant review of the previous training pathway, and international best practice assessment in this area.  They also gave effect to new accreditation standards that were developed by the PSI and place the Core Competency Framework for Pharmacists on a statutory footing.<\/p>  <p>  Moving to an integrated degree format which fully combines and integrates academic and workplace-based learning is designed to produce pharmacists who can more effectively contribute to patient care and understand the needs of the health system by having a more rounded &lsquo;whole system&rsquo; understanding of pharmacy practice across the diversity of settings in which pharmacy is practised.<\/p>  <p>  This change in the pharmacist qualification is designed to enable the pharmacists of the future to meet the changing needs of the healthcare system in Ireland.  The degree will also allow greater integration with the very successful pharmaceutical industry reflecting the Government&rsquo;s policy approach to the forging of strong partnerships with industry and collaborative links across academic institutions.  Furthermore, moving to an integrated degree structure is intended to bring the education and training of pharmacists more closely into line with the format of the other members of the healthcare team, i.e. medicine, nursing, allied health.<\/p>  <p>  The new five-year integrated Master&rsquo;s degree in pharmacy, delivered by the three schools of pharmacy in Ireland (TCD, RCSI, UCC), has been developed in line with best international practice.  It differs substantially from the former educational model, replacing the '4+1' structure that consists of a 4-year Bachelor pharmacy degree programme followed by a one-year internship programme or placement, with a fully integrated course structure.<\/p>  <p>  Further information in relation to these changes can be requested from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200076#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":778,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200076#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":779,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[19251\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200076#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been brought to concerns raised by authorities of a school in (details supplied) County Donegal regarding the ongoing delays experienced to date in progressing a school building project which has been included as part of the capital programme 2016 to 2021; if construction of the project will begin in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":780,"content":"<p>The major building project for the school to which the Deputy refers is at an advanced stage of architectural planning - Stage 2(b) - Detailed Design, which includes the applications for Planning Permission, Fire Certificate and Disability Access Certificate and the preparation of tender documents.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is a separate statutory agency, allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually, taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of all of the children concerned, rather than solely by reference to a pupils disability categorisation. <\/p>  <p>  SNAs do not have a pedagogical role and it would not be appropriate for pupils with special educational needs to be taught by SNAs. \u00a0The classroom teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his\/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need.\u00a0 Additional teaching resources are also\u00a0allocated to mainstream schools to support pupils with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE have up to and including the current school year, also allocated Low Incidence Teaching Hours (LITH) to schools to support children who have an identified special educational need within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05, to which the Deputy refers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The new model for allocating special education teachers to schools which has been\u00a0introduced for the 2017\/18 school year, replaces teaching resources allocated under the Low Incidence Teaching Hours and the General Allocation Model for primary schools.  The new model\u00a0provides a single unified allocation of special educational teaching support to schools.\u00a0 Allocations based on the school profiles issued to all schools on 7th March, details have also been published on the NCSE website.\u00a0 My Department&rsquo;s Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools sets out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.\u00a0 Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The new model will give greater autonomy to schools to allocate resources to the pupils who most need these resources, regardless of their diagnosis.

It recommended actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed. Implementation of the actions is ongoing and good progress has been made across all areas of the plan. <\/p><p>As part of the implementation of the Action Plan my Department published new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools at the beginning of the 2013\/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. <\/p><p>All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of these procedures. A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.<\/p><p>The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.<\/p><p>The anti-bullying procedures also include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>The procedures for schools put in place important new oversight arrangements at school level that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website. <\/p><p>There is no requirement on schools to report incidents of bullying behaviour to my Department and therefore the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available. However,\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, in the course of their whole school inspection work, gathers information about how schools deal with bullying in a number of ways through:<\/p><p>- Review of relevant school\u00a0documentation, including the school&rsquo;s Code of Behaviour and Anti-Bullying\u00a0policy;<\/p><p>- Meetings with parents and student representatives at which there is an opportunity for parents and students\u00a0to raise issues where relevant and;<\/p><p>- The inclusion of parent and student\u00a0Questionnaires on items relating to bullying. <\/p><p>Students and parents are asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying and discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children.

It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.<\/p>  <p>  The publications 'Wellbeing in Post Primary Schools\u00a0- Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013)'\u00a0and 'Wellbeing in Primary Schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015)' have been developed by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key education and health partners and by the findings of research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and wellbeing in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE Health Promoting Schools process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services. \u00a0In addition, Wellbeing guidelines have been produced to assist implementation from September 2017 of the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme.

The index contains variables which provide a measure of the underlying risk of educational disadvantage and the exploratory analysis conducted by the Educational Research Centre shows that there is a moderate to strong correlation between scores on the HP index and poorer educational outcomes across the school spectrum, particularly in urban and post primary schools.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that as part of my announcement in February in launching DEIS Plan 2017, I made it clear that we would continue to conduct further analysis to examine other strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  In view of this, as set out in both the Report on the Review of DEIS and DEIS Plan 2017, the Technical Group will continue its work, supplemented as necessary by additional research and data expertise.  <\/p><p>A key objective of DEIS Plan 2017 is to achieve a more dynamic and tailored process for the assessment of schools which will more closely match resources to identified need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200078#WRS05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":960,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[20279\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200078#WRS05600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools that have requested verification of the data used to identify the levels of concentrated disadvantage in their school for the purposes of identifying their eligibility for support under the DEIS programme;

Arrangements for this are in hand and schools will be advised in due course.<\/p><p>I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communication\u00a0to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model, including\u00a0details of\u00a0how\u00a0the datasets\u00a0are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for schools to provide detailed and up to date information\u00a0to my Department's\u00a0online pupil databases.<\/p><p>The implementation of the new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model. The completion of this work\u00a0will inform ongoing provision and consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200080#WRU00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":1038,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200080#WRU00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1039,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[20696\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200080#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out the new apprenticeship programmes that have been introduced in 2016 and to date in 2017; and the new apprenticeship programmes that are to be introduced in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.","asker":"1327","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1040,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[20697\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200080#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set down the duration, NFQ level and partner educational or training institute of new apprenticeships introduced in 2016 and to date in 2017; and the number to be introduced in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.","asker":"1327","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1041,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 397 and 398 together.<\/p><p>The material sought by the Deputy is set out in the table.<\/p><p>During 2016, 2 new apprenticeship programmes got underway with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship commencing in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship in November.

It is integrated into European Social Fund (ESF) programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 (PEIL) that was adopted by Commission Decision in February 2015.  The specific YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.<\/p>  <p>  The ESF Regulations provide for initial pre-financing\/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation. However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  The ESF regulations also provide that annual pre-financing for any year in which an interim payment application is not made in that year must also be reimbursed.<\/p>  <p>  As Ireland did not submit an interim YEI payment application, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission. \u00a0Furthermore, as there was no ESF application made in 2016, the &euro;11.6m annual pre-financing for 2016,\u00a0including &euro;1.36m for the YEI, will be offset against the 2017 pre-financing due.  The reimbursement of these amounts has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, as the YEI activities are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to them. The YEI funding is available for draw down before the end of 2018 and it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has advised that it obtained EU funding under the European Commission&rsquo;s call for proposals for preparatory actions under the Youth Guarantee Pilot, to pilot a Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun which operated in 2014.

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the success of the initial RLS pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the pilot\u00a0was expanded on a national basis from 23 February\u00a02017.  In recognition of both the critical demand for additional units and the potential the RLS scheme has to offer, I have assigned additional funding\u00a0to the scheme in 2017, bringing the total amount of investment available this year to &euro;32m, which will facilitate up to 800 vacant properties being brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  In the period since the launch of the scheme,\u00a0my Department has been engaging bilaterally with local authorities and AHBs, including Kildare\u00a0County Council,\u00a0to\u00a0provide support and assistance\u00a0in the implementation of the scheme.  Two workshops\u00a0have been\u00a0convened to introduce the scheme to\u00a0local authority and AHB staff and to\u00a0provide practical\u00a0information and assistance\u00a0on\u00a0how best to develop the RLS in their areas.  A detailed guidance document, template legal agreements, application forms\u00a0and other resources have also\u00a0been made available to\u00a0local authorities\u00a0and AHBs in order to assist in the implementation of the scheme and minimise\u00a0the impact of the scheme on existing resources.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the\u00a0RLS has been designed to draw on the expertise and experience\u00a0gained by\u00a0AHBs on social housing acquisitions and leasing\u00a0in recent years and it is open to local authorities to work in collaboration with AHBs in their areas to maximise the potential impact of the scheme.  However, local authorities\u00a0retain overall responsibility for the implementation of the scheme in their area and for ensuring that housing units brought into use under the scheme are required and fulfil social housing demand in their areas.  Where collaboration with AHBs is facilitated, local authorities then have increased capacity to focus on core construction programmes, land management and mixed tenure goals.  The delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland is focussed on a need to acknowledge the blend of delivery routes available and to harness the maximum capacity of all stakeholders operating in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.

Irish Water as a single national utility is taking a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013, Irish Water is required to consult with a number of stakeholders, including local authorities, when preparing an Investment Plan. Accordingly, Irish Water undertook formal consultations on the emerging Investment Plan with a wide range of stakeholders, including all statutory consultees such as local authorities, the Public Water Forum, and those recommended by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  In addition to the formal consultation with local authorities, I understand that workshops were held with water services personnel during the summer of 2016 as part of the development of the Investment Plan, which contributed to the development of Irish Water&rsquo;s understanding of the asset base and identification of needs across the water supply and wastewater infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s primary function is to provide clean drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment.  In providing these services Irish Water plays a central role in enabling economic growth, protecting both the environment and the health and safety of its customers and the public.<\/p>  <p>  Following decades of under-investment, there are now many competing investment needs across the State.  Irish Water&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan is an important part of the process of meeting this investment need in a balanced way.  In a constrained funding environment, Irish Water needs to understand and consider all available views in order to ensure that\u00a0available investment is appropriately balanced\u00a0across competing areas. Consequently Irish Water must take a number of considerations into account when weighing up the relative merits of investment needs.<\/p>  <p>  It is an objective of Irish Water that the interventions in its Investment Plan should be balanced across the various drivers including supporting future population growth, economic development, provision of safe and secure drinking water supplies, minimising the impact of wastewater discharges on the environment and maintaining the Irish Water asset base.<\/p>  <p>  The Investment Plan sets out the approach taken to optimise intervention options by examining their contribution to specific performance targets.  Irish Water has taken on board and responded to the consultation process undertaken in setting very challenging targets for the Investment Plan 2017-2021, such as:<\/p>  <p>- reducing\u00a0the number of Boil Water Notices in place for greater than 200 days from\u00a0over 4,000 to zero;<\/p>  <p>- reducing the number of schemes on\u00a0the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Remedial Action List from 71 to zero;<\/p>  <p>- increasing compliance with the parameters for Lead in Drinking Water from an estimated 85% to 98%;<\/p>  <p>- reducing network leakage volume by 180 Megalitres per day;<\/p>  <p>- rationalisation\u00a0of 105 Water Treatment Works;<\/p>  <p>- increasing\u00a0the Population Equivalent (PE) served by Wastewater Treatment Works compliant with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive from 2.4m to 4.8m;<\/p>  <p>- reducing\u00a0the number of public wastewater agglomerations with no-treatment from 37\u00a0to zero.<\/p>  <p>  This investment balancing process towards the achievement of challenging targets is a key element of the value Irish Water brings as a single national utility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200081#WRV02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Licence Conditions","counter":1117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200081#WRV02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1118,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[19225\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200081#WRV03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"to outline the reason only nine working days have been granted from the date of public notification, 24 March 2017 to 6 April 2017, regarding a licence (details supplied) on Galway Bay; if this period meets his Department's regulations on timeframes for public observations to be made on foreshore licence applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1119,"content":"<p>A foreshore licence application was received in my Department in September 2016 to retain the existing linear acoustic telemetry array spanning Galway Bay for the purpose of studying marine migrations of salmonoids in the bay and the\u00a0monitoring of marine animals tagged in other studies with a view to contributing to spatial planning and conservation management.<\/p>  <p>  The details of this application were published in Irish and English in the Irish Examiner on 29th September 2016 and the Connaught Tribune on 30th September 2016.

There are currently more\u00a0than 20,700 households in receipt of HAP, including 7,000 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key principles of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice, as provided for under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  This is distinct from other forms of social housing support, where the tenant may not always find their\u00a0own accommodation and instead\u00a0are allocated a dwelling.  Under the Homeless HAP scheme, which is operated by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive on behalf of the 4 Dublin local authorities, a place finder service has been provided to assist homeless households with sourcing HAP accommodation.  A similar service will be available to homeless households in the Cork City Council area from 8 May 2017.  Given that to date in 2017, an average of almost 350 additional households a week are being supported by HAP, I consider the practice of households sourcing their own accommodation under the scheme to be an effective approach to providing housing support, as it gives households choice.<\/p>  <p>  There is no limitation on the length of a tenancy that can be supported by the HAP scheme.  HAP supported tenancies are agreed between the landlord and the tenant; the local authority is not a party to the tenancy and has no role in its agreement.  However, as with other private rental tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) governs the relationship between the landlord and the tenant.  The length of the tenancy is a matter that must be agreed between the landlord and tenant.  My Department does not hold information in relation to the length of individual tenancies.<\/p>  <p>  Where a HAP supported tenancy comes to an end, the tenant can find alternative accommodation and retain their eligibility for HAP support or the local authority may decide to offer another form of social housing support to the tenant in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2016, all local authorities have been provided with a statutory discretion to exceed HAP rent limits by up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.  At the end of Q1 2017, 9.5% of the total number of households (excluding qualified homeless households) being supported by HAP had some additional flexibility applied to the monthly HAP payment being made to their landlord on their behalf. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it\u00a0to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious delivery programme committed to under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200082#WRW02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters","counter":1163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200082#WRW02725"},{"type":"question","counter":1164,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[19382\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200082#WRW02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 402 of 21 March 2017, the number of meter boxes that were not reused by Uisce &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1165,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 402 of 21 March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water committed to reusing previously installed meter boxes where possible.

including planning permissions, commencement notices, ESB connections and several others - from various sources, each of which measure different aspects of housing market activity.  Each dataset presents part of the overall housing activity picture but none of the datasets were specifically designed to count new houses.<\/p>  <p>  Since the 1970s,\u00a0my \u00a0Department has published ESB data on residential properties connected to the ESB grid, as a proxy for house completions, as it represents the best available indicator that a residential unit is becoming available for occupation.  This dataset includes recently completed once-off homes, multi-unit scheme developments and apartments as well as some reconnections to the grid, where properties that have been unoccupied for over two years are being brought back into use.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  ESB data are collected at\u00a0a point in time\u00a0when the home is connected to the grid and bears no relationship to the period of its construction.  My Department has regularly drawn attention to this fact in the context of the recent economic and construction collapse where many homes commenced before\u00a02008 but\u00a0remained unfinished for several years and have\u00a0gradually been finished out and brought to the marketplace as recovery took\u00a0hold.  Indeed, for a number of years my Department has published the results of annual surveys undertaken in relation to unfinished housing developments, including details in relation to the progress on completion of such developments.<\/p>  <p>  In this context the Department has published data indicating that, based on ESB connections, 12,666 homes became available in 2015, 14,932 homes in 2016 and, based on current trends, it is anticipated that this figure will rise to 18,000 homes in 2017.  The Department is working closely with the ESB in an attempt to obtain additional, more granular data from\u00a0its dataset to\u00a0get a further\u00a0and deeper understanding of the various components of the overall connection data.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the ESB figures are by no means the only dataset used to measure housing activity.  For example, detailed information on residential construction activity is available from certain local authorities\u00a0- at the end of 2016, the four Dublin local authorities reported 144 active construction sites, encompassing the construction of some 5,200 new dwellings.  This is a really important source of information in terms of informing policies aimed at increasing supply in the key Dublin housing market.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the\u00a0Building Control Management System (BCMS), it is important to note that the BCMS was introduced with effect from 1 March 2014 to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990, as amended.  The building control process includes a requirement, in certain circumstances, to lodge a statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion (CCC) in respect of buildings, including dwellings.  While this represents another useful source of data on residential completions, it also has a number of limitations in this regard.  Firstly, CCCs apply only to works commenced on or after 1 March 2014 and so would not apply to homes completed at a current date which were subject to a commencement notice submitted prior to 1 March 2014.  Secondly, one-off houses were given the facility to opt out of the statutory CCC process on and from 1st September 2015, so not all single homes constructed will appear in these returns.  Finally, a CCC may cover multiple buildings or works, so the number of CCCs registered on the BCMS does not correlate to the number of building units completed.  My Department is actively engaging with the Local Government Management Agency, which hosts the BCMS, with a view to developing its potential further as an additional source of data in relation to house building activity.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office, which is the State&rsquo;s authoritative voice in relation to the provision of high quality and independent statistical information supporting evidence-based decision-making, established an independent group in January 2017, chaired by an Assistant Director General, to examine housing statistics and\u00a0my Department is a member of that group.\u00a0 This group is considering the best analytical approaches to reconciling and combining datasets in this area and will have oversight of, and a direct involvement in, the examination of any output arising from the variety of analyses currently underway.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department has also established a new Housing Data Analytics Group, with membership from the CSO, Central Bank, local authorities and others to examine this complex area and to monitor and review the various sources of data collected nationally to provide a comprehensive and coherent suite of statistics relating to housing matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200083#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund","counter":1220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200083#WRX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1221,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[19654\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200083#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if funding from LIHAF may be available to progress a second bridge over the River Liffey in Celbridge and provide some of the required infrastructure to allow the magnitude of new housing provided for in the context of the Celbridge local area plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1222,"content":"<p>The aim of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF)\u00a0is to relieve critical infrastructural blockages in order to enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in urban areas with high demand for housing.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A call for proposals was issued to all local authorities in August 2016.

This collective agreement provided, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for the appointment of an Expert Group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters.  The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 year of age.  Following the report of the Expert Group published in April 2003, a circular was issued by my\u00a0Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the Expert Report.<\/p><p>In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established Industrial Relations processes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200083#WRX03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Accommodation Scheme","counter":1242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200083#WRX03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1243,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[19839\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200083#WRX03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the way in which the affordable rental scheme will function; if the affordable rental pilot scheme which was announced in October 2015 was completed; if so, if he will provide a report on same; the likely breakdown between private and commercial landlords he envisions; his plans to place a limit on the number of either group involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1244,"content":"<p>Building on the announcement made in October 2015, Action 4.6 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.<\/p><p>As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector published in December 2016, the commitment on affordable rental\u00a0is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.

Its remit includes monitoring relevant housing data on the supply of viable and market-ready approved developments in the region.<\/p><p>In that regard, in its report for Quarter 4 2016, the Taskforce reports a total of 144 active residential development construction sites across Dublin, which will deliver some 5,200 homes.

The cost of these projects is &euro;226.46 million, &euro;112.72 million of which has been allocated to\u00a012 projects across the 4 Dublin local authorities.  These projects are expected to enable delivery of\u00a0approximately 13,500 homes in Dublin by 2021, with the potential to provide around 37,500 homes in the longer term, with a strong focus on affordability.  The overall increase in supply should also help ease the pressure on rented accommodation.

The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.

Guidelines entitled &ldquo;Rent Assessment, Collection, Accounting and Arrears Control&rdquo; were published by the Housing Unit (which subsequently became part of the Housing Agency) in January 2001.  These guidelines, developed in conjunction with my Department and the City and County Management Association, set out good practice in the administration of rent related matters.  The Guidelines stated that local authorities should review the rent assessment of all existing tenants at least annually to ensure that all tenants are paying the correct rent and to update rents to reflect changes in tenants&rsquo; incomes and in housing management costs.<\/p>  <p>  It will normally be a part of the tenancy agreement that the tenant should inform the local authority of any change in circumstances, including increases in family income.

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website (www.pyriteboard.ie).<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.

I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the scheme does not apply to dwellings which have a Damage Condition Rating of 1, the Board does not maintain records on the number of properties that fall into this category.

The Government took the decision to designate\u00a0Poolbeg\u00a0West as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ)\u00a0because of its potential to deliver a large amount of\u00a0extra homes in the centre of our capital and on an excellent\u00a0site.  The process has moved forward with Dublin City Council&rsquo;s publication of a draft planning scheme for the area under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the public consultation exercise on the preparation of\u00a0the draft planning scheme, my Department has indicated that\u00a0the\u00a0planning\u00a0scheme\u00a0could include a policy mechanism where, on an agreed basis, over and above the statutory requirement that 10% of the housing yield of the site be reserved for social housing under Part V of the Act,\u00a0there would be delivery of up to another 10% of its housing yield, which would be accessible in economic terms for households on average industrial wages, in return for flexibility around the overall\u00a0development yield on the site.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's submission also pointed towards\u00a0a number of delivery models, if such an agreement could be brokered between the owners of the\u00a0site and the local authority and supported by my Department.  These models\u00a0include the potential role of the voluntary housing sector in participating in a joint venture type approach to facilitate the ultimate development of the site which could deliver an increment of housing over and above the 10% social housing requirement in the form of key worker housing as outlined above.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is crucial that people who need social housing and key workers who cannot afford high rents can avail of housing in areas like Poolbeg.  My\u00a0Department will therefore\u00a0continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, housing providers and the local community, in developing and resourcing the mixed-tenure model above and in line with the normal financial safeguards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200086#WRAA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Data","counter":1345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200086#WRAA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1346,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[20863\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200086#WRAA03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the monthly totals of housing units for which local authorities have received planning permission commencement notices for the most recent 12 months for which the data is available, by month and local authority, in tabular form.","asker":"1294","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":1347,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[20864\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200086#WRAA03950","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the monthly totals of housing units for which local authorities have received certificates of compliance on completion for the most recent 12 months for which the data is available, by month and local authority, in tabular form.

The new arrangements (PRSI Class S payable at 4%) apply to all county councillors other than those aged 66 and over and those who are, in conjunction with their membership of a county council, permanent and pensionable civil and public servants recruited before April 1995.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the new arrangements, county councillors had been, since 2011, liable to pay PRSI at Class K (4%) along with other office holders such as members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the judiciary.  PRSI Class K contributions do not provide cover for any social insurance benefit or pension.  I introduced the new arrangements in recognition of the fact that county councillors do not have access to occupational pensions arising from their role as public representatives and that, therefore, it was important that county councillors were covered for social insurance pensions.  County councillors are no longer liable to make a PRSI Class K contribution.<\/p>  <p>  Social insurance contributors can be awarded a maximum of 52 contributions each year.  Where, for example, someone has two (or more) concurrent employments each of 52 weeks duration in a given year, a maximum of 52 contributions are awarded for access to benefits and pensions.  Similar arrangements apply where an individual is both an employee and self-employed.  As the maximum of 52 Class S contributions are awarded each year for self-employed contributors regardless of the actual number of weeks of  self-employment (subject to a minimum paid contribution of &euro;500) two concurrent occupations both paying Class S contributions do not give rise to additional credits or benefits for the contributor.<\/p>  <p>  The position, therefore, in respect of county councillors is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  County councillors who do not have another insurable employment or self-employment now pay Class S and are now covered, as self-employed contributors, for the State Pension (contributory) and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (contributory), Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (contributory), Maternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit, Paternity Benefit, Treatment Benefits (from March 2017) and Invalidity pension (from December 2017).<\/p>  <p>  County councillors who are concurrently engaged in other types of insurable self-employment will be treated in the same way as all other people with multiple self-employments.  A maximum of 52 Class S contributions will be recorded on their social insurance record.  Typical examples are individuals who are engaged in two unrelated self-employments or who have earned and unearned self-employment income or certain company directors who pay Class S (under Schedule E) in their role as directors and Class S (under Schedule D) on income which might or might not be related to their shareholding in a company.<\/p>  <p>  County councillors who are also engaged in insurable employment or employments, (such employments typically paying Class A) will be treated in the same way as other individuals who are in concurrent insurable employment and insurable self-employment.  52 Class S contributions will be due but this number will be reduced by the number of Class A contributions from insurable employment so that the overall total is no more than 52.  This arrangement is to the benefit of the individuals concerned and reflects the fact that a wider range of benefits are available under Class A.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I was pleased to announce a number of measures which will benefit the self-employed, including Councillors.  From March 2017 the self-employed have had access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will be extended for both employees and the self-employed from October 2017 providing further dental and optical benefits.<\/p>  <p>  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed, including county councillors.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to introducing further improvements for the self-employed in line with our commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200087#WRBB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Operation","counter":1362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200087#WRBB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1363,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[19147\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200087#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will address concerns raised (details supplied) in relation to community employment schemes.","asker":"1329","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1364,"content":"<p>My Department provides a range of activation supports catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.

This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension transition (SPT) which was available at age 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions.

The Review will examine the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of the SIF including projecting income and expenditure of the SIF over the period out to 2071.  An important component of this work will be quantifying the impact of the changes in the pension age in 2021 and 2028 based on the most up to date demographic and economic projections.  This information, when available, will assist the Department to estimate (1) the cost of extending entitlement to the SPT to age 66 in 2021 and 2022 and (2) to estimate the cost of SPT in 2021 and 2022 if there was no change in the pension age in 2021 as requested by the Deputy.

In 2016, some 1.7 million applications for benefit, assistance and access to schemes were received and processed and over 82 million individual payments were made to people across all age groups and to employers.  The scale of its operations and expenditure demand that a robust and integrated range of control and anti-fraud measures are in place.  Measures to prevent and detect fraud and enhance controls across the Department&rsquo;s various schemes are set out in the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy which covers the period 2014 &ndash; 2018. <\/p><p>In 2016, the Department achieved overall savings of &euro;506m as a result of control and anti-fraud measures.

The &ldquo;direct marketing&rdquo; element of the campaign appeals to the public to report fraud and makes is easier for them to do so.  It also affords an opportunity to increase awareness of the Department&rsquo;s fraud reporting contact numbers and online reporting options;<\/p><p>- Demonstrate that the Government and Department takes the issue of social welfare fraud very seriously and that it will investigate and prosecute, where this is found to be warranted; and<\/p><p>- Demonstrate that the Department is very conscious of its obligations, as one of the largest spending Departments in the State, and the importance of protecting the integrity of the social welfare system.  <\/p><p>The delivery of the campaign will achieve a balance of coverage across all demographics and regions and incorporate print, national and regional radio stations, digital and outdoor advertising.  The national and regional radio, print and outdoor advertising will run for a period of two weeks, with a longer timeframe of 4 to 6 weeks for digital\/online advertising.  The cost of the advertising campaign is &euro;165,988 excluding VAT.  It includes all design and advertising costs associated with the campaign (print advertising, national and regional radio advertising, outdoor and online\/digital advertising).  No additional costs arise in staff resources, website development or the provision of the telephone reporting facility.<\/p><p>The Department has set no specific savings targets for this campaign.  An overall savings target of &euro;510 million has been set for 2017 and additional reporting from members of the public will support the Department in achieving this target.

The software utilises a biometric template of a human face digitised from a photograph.  The system identifies a person by measuring certain structural features of their face and comparing these with other identity records maintained by the Department.  Every new photograph captured by the PSC process is compared with all other photographs on the database.  This ensures that an individual has not already been registered for a PSC using a different identity.  <\/p>  <p>  Where there is suspicion that a person has attempted to gain a PSC where a Card has already been issued to a person matching the same facial profile, the matter is referred to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to make further enquiries and to refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation and prosecution under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, as appropriate.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that as of 25 April 2017, 155 suspected cases of identify fraud have been referred to the SIU and\/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This was a response to increasing life expectancy, which has been well documented both in Ireland and internationally, and the requirement to make the pension system sustainable while ensuring the rate of payment is adequate.  <\/p><p>More recently, the OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirmed that the reforms that have been introduced, including these increases in pension age, are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given increased life expectancy and the increasing cost of pensions into the future.  Notably, that report commented that &ldquo;<i>financial sustainability is not guaranteed unless pension ages are increased beyond current plans in most OECD countries, including Ireland&rdquo;.  <\/i><\/p><p>My Department participates in a number of bodies which examine this issue, notably in the context of the European Union, and I am very aware of developments in this area internationally, where most countries recognise that increasing pension age is an important tool in maintaining the adequacy of state pension systems. <\/p><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age as announced in the National Pensions Framework.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014.  It is estimated that the net savings from this measure amount to over &euro;80 million per annum.  As the State Pension (transition) could only be paid if the recipient had retired, and given such a criterion does not apply to the State pension (contributory), the abolition of that pension removed a significant disincentive to those who did not wish to retire at State pension age.  <\/p><p>In advance of the abolition of the State pension (transition), in 2012 an Interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group convened to discuss the wide range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers, including enterprise issues and employment and equality law issues.  This was in order to consider cross departmental policy issues that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of the pensions system.<\/p><p>More recently, in January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>The forthcoming independent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide further information regarding future pension costs.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200091#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1559,"content":"<p>Question No. 592 answered with Question No. 589.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Data","counter":1560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200091#WRFF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1561,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[20296\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200091#WRFF00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons currently in receipt of the full rate of contributory State pension who have made total contributions or credits of under 900, 900 to 1,200, 1,200 to 1,500, 1,500 to 1,800 and 1,800; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1562,"content":"<p>The statistics in the format requested by the Deputy are not available.  <\/p><p>The determining factor of a person&rsquo;s qualifying rate of entitlement to state pension (contributory) is the yearly average of the number of social insurance contributions, paid and credited, over the person&rsquo;s working life.

It helps them to secure and sustain full-time paid employment.  Participants spend 12 months on JobPath and receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are provided with a range of training and development supports.  If the jobseeker secures employment they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment. <\/p>  <p>  T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which provides short-term, work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.

The department has contracts in place with 68 companies for the provision of these services (this includes two contracts with JobPath service providers).  The services being delivered do not create employment in themselves, rather it is the role of the staff of these services to assist and support jobseekers to enter \/ re-enter employment in the open labour market.  <\/p><p>The JobPath element of the service has been designed to support long-term unemployed people and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.  The service model has a number of key features, for example, every participant is provided with a service guarantee - a baseline level of service covering, inter-alia, frequency of engagement, personal progression planning, geographic accessibility and in-employment support.<\/p><p>In the case of East Galway, to date, 726 people have commenced their engagement period with the service.  These clients were referred to the service from the Intreo Centre in Loughrea, and the Social Welfare Branch Offices in Gort and Tuam.<\/p><p>It is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.

We have supported petitions for him to be returned to Ireland under Egyptian Law 140; we have appealed for him to be released under the Egyptian President&rsquo;s &lsquo;Youth Amnesty&rsquo; Scheme, and we have stressed in all contacts the humanitarian dimensions of the case as grounds under which we believe he should be released.  <\/p>  <p>  On April 3rd, the Taoiseach once again made direct and personal contact with President el-Sisi to renew the Government&rsquo;s appeal to the Egyptian authorities to release this Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay.

This includes more than seventy post offices in Northern Ireland and more than one thousand post offices in this state.  With the availability of both the online passport renewal service for adults and the An Post Passport Express service, very few applicants in Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.  These appointments must be made online.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the online passport application service which I launched on 30 March will greatly assist in managing current and future passport demand.  The service is for adults who are renewing their existing passport, whether they live in Ireland or overseas and it is available twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.  The target turnaround time for applications submitted through the online service is ten working days plus postage.  Since the launch over twelve thousand online applications for passport books and\/or passport cards have been received.  <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the service will result in reduced turnaround times and fewer demands over time on the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  The service will be extended to all applicants, including first-time applicants and children, by 2019.  People who cannot or do not wish to apply online will continue to be able to apply through a service provider with an extensive network of contact points throughout the country.  <\/p>  <p>  The rationale for the opening of additional Passport Offices, particularly given the range of service options available to applicants, is not clear.  Applications, when received by the Passport Service, are streamlined into categories, such as renewals, new, and renewals of lost\/stolen passports.  This enables the Passport Service to allocate resources to applications requiring more checks.  An emergency service is available for citizens that need to travel for medical reasons or due to the bereavement of a close family member.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of individuals who are available to participate in election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.<\/p><p>The election observation roster was established for a five year period following a public call for applications in May 2013.  It is expected that it will operate until May 2018.  Officials will work on the details relating to the criteria and methodology in respect of the call for applications for the new roster.  It is anticipated that these will be finalised before the end of the year and a public call for new applicants will issue shortly thereafter.  Details will be published on the Irish Aid website () and existing roster members and those who have expressed an interest in receiving details about the next roster will also be advised.<\/p><p>In 2013, following an independent appraisal process, the 200 successful candidates and the 10 members of the reserve panel were advised that membership of the roster was subject to Garda vetting and acceptance of the Irish Aid Code of Conduct.  On foot of the subsequent Garda vetting process of these applicants, all but two individuals on the list were confirmed.<\/p><p>Officials of the Department are in regular contact with the OSCE and EU election Focal Points and also participate in the European Observation network which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  The network facilities the exchange of information on all aspects of election rosters and missions.<\/p><p>If specific complaints or issues relating to observers are brought to the attention of officials, these would be fully investigated and if found to be proven and significant or in breach of the Code of Conduct signed by roster members, the individual roster member would be removed from the election roster.  Since the formation of the roster, no such complaints have been received.<\/p><p>Members of the roster who are nominated by the Department to undertake election observation missions do not receive remuneration.  They are paid a daily allowance to cover the cost of food, accommodation and all other out-of-pocket expenses, together with the pre-departure grant of &euro;600 to cover associated expenses.  The Department does not seek tax clearance certification from observers prior to participation in a mission.<\/p><p>The Department deploys members of the roster and, from time to time, officials who work on the relevant geographic desks, on election observation missions, organised under the auspices of the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).The election observation roster is the only means through which we provide a structure to support Irish election observers.A number of independent NGOs also deploy monitors to observe elections throughout the world and the Department is aware of a number of Irish nationals who have deployed on such missions.  These individuals can avail of consular advice and assistance, but would not be eligible for the supports, including payment of travel and subsistence costs, which are only paid to members of the roster who have succeeded in being selected for the election roster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200094#WRJJJJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":1724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200095#WRKKKK00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Expenditure","counter":1723,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200095#WRKKKK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1724,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[19379\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200095#WRKKKK00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount allocated to flood relief measures in budgets 2015 and 2016; the amount which was spent in each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":1725,"content":"<p>The information requested is shown in the table and relates to the allocations for capital investment on flood risk management in the Vote of the Office of Public Works:<table><tr><th><\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Allocation<\/td><td>&euro;61.284m<\/td><td>&euro;52.561m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Outturn<\/td><td>&euro;48.368m<\/td><td>&euro;51.856m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Expenditure on the flood relief programme in 2015 was less than budgeted for due primarily to delays in the planned commencement of construction of certain capital projects.

The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. <\/p>  <p>  Of the sites featuring on the Tentative List, the greater progress so far has been with the Royal Sites serial nomination which includes Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex and Navan Fort (Eamhain Macha). Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six component sites and my Department is holding ongoing meetings of stakeholders from all six locations to review progress and to chart the next steps.  It was agreed that the technical evaluations would be sent for international peer review following which work will need to begin on developing draft management plans for each site, including designation of core and buffer zones in each case.  A further plenary meeting of this group is scheduled for next June. The process will also have to take into account that some sites will be managed by the Office of Public Works, others by local authorities, that two are privately owned and that Eamhain Macha is in Northern Ireland.  The culmination of these steps, which will also have to be adopted with each of the other tentative list nominations, would be the creation of the full nomination documents for each site for submission to UNESCO. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can.  The process is undoubtedly both complex and lengthy and the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at every stage.

This event was part of the ongoing engagement with civil society initiated through the series of All-Island Civic Dialogues hosted by the Taoiseach.  The actions set out in Realising our Rural Potential, the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development launched in January, will also assist in supporting rural communities, including those in border areas, to meet the challenges posed by Brexit and to position themselves to avail of the opportunities which also may arise.\u00a0 The Action Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies and sets out to support sustainable communities, support enterprise and employment, maximise our rural and recreation potential, foster culture and creativity, and improve rural connectivity.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The plan sets out a number of actions which will address the effects of Brexit in particular. For example, a specific piece of research will be commissioned on the impact of Brexit on rural areas, and particularly rural areas in the Border region.

This Working Group is supported by the Department's EU Coordination Unit which is also responsible for managing those issues relating to Brexit that fall within my Department&rsquo;s remit.

The process included full public consultation and an in-depth review of all proposed candidate sites.  My Department has engaged with local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals on the Tentative List to gauge the extent of the support available to advance the proposals and to clarify the work and resources required for that purpose.  The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. <\/p>  <p>  Of the sites featuring on the Tentative List, the greater progress so far has been with the Royal Sites serial nomination which includes Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex and Navan Fort (Eamhain Macha). Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six component sites and my Department is engaged in on-going discussions with stakeholders from all six locations to review progress and to chart the next steps. In that context, it has been agreed that the technical evaluations will be sent for international peer review following which work will begin on developing draft management plans for each site, including designation of core and buffer zones in each case. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the process, the Steering Group representative of stakeholders from each area will be visiting each of the six sites. The next such site visit, and further plenary meeting, is planned for Rathcroghan in June.<\/p>  <p>  The culmination of these steps, which will also have to be adopted with each of the other tentative list nominations, would be the creation of the full nomination documents for submission to UNESCO. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can.  The process is undoubtedly both complex and lengthy and the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at every stage.

Our 6 \u00a0National Parks\u00a0account for circa 60,000 hectares with another almost 20,000 hectares \u00a0of\u00a0nature reserves and other heritage sites.  While \u00a0the\u00a0existing \u00a0National Parks\u00a0are managed from a conservation perspective, it is also recognised that they are &lsquo;core assets&rsquo; which play a very important role in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism and indeed active walker industry. \u00a0The National Parks\u00a0and Wildlife Service manages and maintains more than 485km \u00a0of\u00a0trails between \u00a0National Parks, Nature Reserves and other conservation \/recreational properties. These are dispersed geographically across \u00a0the\u00a0country and attracted in excess \u00a0of 4 million visitors annually. Within \u00a0the National Parks\u00a0alone, \u00a0the\u00a0NPWS is responsible for a trail network spanning some 220km, including both cycling and walking trails, which run over some \u00a0of the\u00a0most iconic and scenic landscapes in Ireland. In addition, long-distance trails such as \u00a0the\u00a0Wicklow and Kerry Way, 129km and 122km respectively, run through \u00a0the National Parks\u00a0and are also maintained by the NPWS.

In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated \u00a0the\u00a0extension \u00a0of\u00a0Wicklow Mountains \u00a0National Park\u00a0 by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins \u00a0the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to \u00a0the preservation \u00a0of\u00a0 our natural heritage for future generations of\u00a0citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership earlier this year with a view to growing tourism revenues in \u00a0the\u00a0rural areas where \u00a0the parks\u00a0are located and \u00a0increasing\u00a0Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.   <\/p>  <p>I also have a role, as Minister, in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by planning authorities to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.   <\/p>  <p>My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites on both a rural and regional basis. As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014   of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument. Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW). Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation     and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care most of which are regionally spread. <\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State. Anyone proposing works to a monument\u00a0that is\u00a0included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.   <\/p>  <p>  I launched the Built Heritage Investment Scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.\u00a0 This scheme operated in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014 and which is being run again this year. <\/p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.\u00a0 This fund is being run again in 2017 and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to be able to say that tomorrow I expect to announce a significant investment in both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund for 2017. These will now support a large number of projects across every local authority area in the country.   <\/p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a state initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Arts, Heritage Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities both urban and rural. They are also a research and educational resource. <\/p>  <p>  In view of the broad range of measures in place across the various areas of our built heritage which I have outlined above which involve my Department, Local Government and the OPW, I would consider such investment in our rural and regional sites as central to the objectives set out in the Action Plan for Rural Development.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":2041,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR00600"},{"type":"question","counter":2042,"qnumday":764,"qnumall":"[20811\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR00700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she can foresee job creation in rural areas through investment in the arts sector and heritage projects with particular reference to the need to promote historic locations from an educational and tourism aspect; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":2043,"content":"<p>My Department works to invest in rural Ireland across all its programme areas.

The Agency plays a vital role in the protection of the health of 500 million EU citizens through the scientific evaluation and safety monitoring of human and veterinary medicines and I believe Dublin is the right choice for the new host city.<\/p><p>In October 2016 the Irish Government agreed that Dublin should be promoted as a suitable new location for the EMA. An interdepartmental\/interagency working group, chaired at a senior level by the Department of Health, has been set up to prepare a bid in support of the relocation of the Agency to Dublin. This group has commenced its work with a view to finalising a proposal this year for submission to the European Council in due course.<\/p><p>The Government believes that Dublin would be a very suitable location for the EMA, particularly in the interests of ensuring continuity and sustainability in the conduct of its business. Such continuity is critical for European citizens and the industries which the EMA regulates. <\/p><p>Dublin is a safe, modern, open and multicultural city which can offer a range of advantages to the EMA including:<\/p><blockquote>- Whole-of-government support for the relocation;<br \/><br \/>- Excellent connectivity through Dublin Airport to Europe;<br \/><br \/>- A dynamic life sciences sector;<br \/><br \/>- High quality of life for staff and their families;<br \/><br \/>- Strong education and research credentials; and<br \/><br \/>- All the amenities of a modern capital city.<\/blockquote><p>The relocation of the EMA also represents an opportunity to attract a prestigious EU Agency to Dublin which will directly employ almost 1,000 staff and attract many more high-quality jobs in associated sectors.  The EMA is also key to maintaining the competitiveness of the European pharmaceutical industry, which is worth approximately &euro;260 billion annually.<\/p><p>Its location in Dublin would also stimulate employment in ancillary sectors, including the hospitality and transport industries.<\/p><p>I met with permanent representatives of EU Member States in Brussels last Friday to set out the strength of the Irish bid. I also met the Belgian health Minister to promote Dublin for the EMA. I will officially launch the brochure in Dublin, along with an accompanying website on Thursday 4 May. This will be followed by visits to cities around Europe to promote the Dublin bid. <\/p><p>The plan is that in each city stop there will be a bilateral meeting between me or Minister of State Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, with our equivalent health minister.  However, the Irish delegation would also include senior representatives from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) as well as the IDA Ireland, to allow us to project the strength of the coalition we have built in Ireland to support Dublin&rsquo;s bid.<\/p><p>Ultimately the decision on the new location for the EMA will be made by the European Council at heads of state or government level. Therefore I want to ensure in advance of that decision that European leaders are clear that Dublin is the best location for the EMA and is ready, willing and able to host it successfully. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":2079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR04300"},{"type":"question","counter":2080,"qnumday":778,"qnumall":"[19151\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons that are eligible for the free under six general practitioner scheme; the number of persons that have registered under the scheme to date; if he has conducted research on the reason some persons are not taking up the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2081,"qnumday":780,"qnumall":"[19153\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will instruct the HSE to assist\u00a0persons that wish to enrol their\u00a0children under the free under six general practitioner scheme but that are unable to access a general practitioner that is accepting new patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Persons who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis. Details of the numbers of private patients attending particular GPs are not collected by the Department of Health or the HSE.<\/p><p>The introduction of GP care without fees to children under 6 represents a major step forward in improving access, quality and affordability of health care in Ireland.  The under 6s GP service contract, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a cycle of care for children with asthma, underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in their own community.<\/p><p>To date, approximately 95% of GMS GPs have entered into agreements with the HSE for the provision of services to children under 6 and 364,426 children under 6 have access to GP care without fees through a medical card or GP visit card. This represents approximately 90% of the under 6 population, according to the latest census information available from the CSO for this age cohort.<\/p><p>Information on the total number of persons who have registered for GP care without fees for under 6s to date is not readily available to my Department.  In any event, it should be noted that this figure would not reflect the total number of children who currently have access to the service, as many children who registered since the scheme was introduced in 2015 would now have turned 6 years old and would no longer be automatically eligible for GP care without fees. There would also be a proportion of children under 6 who hold medical cards or GP visit cards which were awarded based on an assessment of their family&rsquo;s means, many of whom would have held this card prior to the introduction of  the scheme in 2015.<\/p><p>As of yet, no research has been carried out in relation to why a small percentage of the eligible population have not yet registered for the free GP care for under 6s service. Information on the service is widely available online. However, parents or guardians must register their children to avail of the scheme, and it is up to each parent or guardian to decide if they wish to do so. In some cases, a child may already attend a GP who does not hold a contract with the HSE to provide services to children under 6, and their family may wish for them to continue to attend this GP on a private basis.<\/p><p>Parents\/guardians of eligible children who do not have a Medical Card or GP Visit Card must register them for this new scheme at www.pcrsonline.ie. A printable form is also available on the site or from HSE Local Health Offices if applicants would prefer to submit a paper based form. The site also provides a list, which is updated daily, of GPs taking part in the scheme.  <\/p><p>In the event that an eligible patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him\/her as a patient, the HSE has the power to assign an eligible person to a GP's GMS patient list where the person has been removed from another GP's list or refused entry onto a GP's list, and the person has unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area who are contracted to provide services under the GMS. I would advise any parent or guardian who is experiencing a difficulty in registering a child for the under 6s service to contact the HSE, who will be able to assign their child to a GP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Data","counter":2084,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR04800"},{"type":"question","counter":2085,"qnumday":779,"qnumall":"[19152\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200102#WRRR04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to bring in a national register of general practitioners as recommended in the HSE document on medical workforce planning future demand for GPs 2015 to 2025; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2086,"content":"<p>While no central register exists specifically for GPs working in Ireland, all doctors in practice in Ireland must be registered with the Medical Council.

The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care to ensure sustained quality clinical operational management.  Overall, the programme aims to improve quality, access and cost-effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland.  <\/p><p>The programme can point to many improvements in Stroke care since its inception.  The HSE has previously advised my Department that emergency thrombolysis is provided now to patients in all regions of the country by improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new physicians. <\/p><p>There is national 24\/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis, the rate of which has increased from 1% in 2006 to a current rate of 13%.  This exceeds the national target of 9%. <\/p><p>Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced mortality rates, reduced dependency and shorter lengths of stay in hospital by patients.  Since the commencement of the National Clinical Programme for Stroke, nine new stroke units have been opened, bringing the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-two.  This is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2008 which reported one stroke unit in the country.<\/p><p>The programme has also developed a range of care pathways to assist the streamlining and standardisation of stroke care delivery.<\/p><p>The cost objectives of the programme have also been met with more stroke patients experiencing improved clinical outcomes. Examples include:<\/p><p>- Less stroke patients are dying in hospital: The rate has dropped from 16.2% in 2009 to 14.1% in 2014 &ndash; an overall percentage reduction of 12.9%;<\/p><p>- Less stroke patients are discharged to nursing homes &ndash; and therefore with improved disability outcomes: This has reduced from 17.7% in 2009 to 13.8% in 2014 &ndash; an overall percentage reduction of 22.1%;<\/p><p>- More stroke patients are discharged directly to home from acute hospitals: The rate has increased from 50.7% in 2009 to 51.6% in 2014;<\/p><p>- The median acute hospital length of stay for stroke has fallen from 10 days in 2009 to 9 days in 2014, with an estimated 19,000 bed days saved in the 2011-2014 period.<\/p><p>This is all good news for stroke patients. <\/p><p>As these questions are service matters, they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to each Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200103#WRSS02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Discharges","counter":2127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200103#WRSS02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2128,"qnumday":793,"qnumall":"[19196\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200103#WRSS03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons across each operating site that have been discharged home via early supported discharge for stroke patients since the first ESD rollout in 2011; the percentage of this category compared to total stroke discharges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2129,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200103#WRSS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200103#WRSS03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2131,"qnumday":794,"qnumall":"[19211\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200103#WRSS03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a hospital appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1317","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2132,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The very clear view of the HSE is that the Executive has adhered entirely with the terms and conditions of the lease, and that, given its obligations under the Health Act 2004 (which requires that the HSE uses its resources efficiently and economically to deliver public health services), the HSE does not consider it appropriate to renegotiate the lease agreement.  <\/p><p>Additionally, the Association was advised by my Secretary General that there were not sufficient grounds to intervene in what was essentially an operational matter which is the responsibility of the HSE under legislation.  The HSE is complying with its commercial obligations, and is precluded from offering improved terms to the Association simply to improve its financial resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200104#WRTT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":2192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200105#WRUU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2193,"qnumday":816,"qnumall":"[19310\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200105#WRUU00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the provision of medical cards to all persons in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance as set out in A Programme for a partnership Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2194,"qnumday":969,"qnumall":"[19871\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200105#WRUU00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when children under 16 years of age who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will be entitled to full medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2195,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 816 and 969 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Health (Amendment) Act 2017 was signed by the President on 31st March 2017.

The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccination and the scientific evidence is clear that benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects<\/p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland. While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored and any new evidence concerning side-effects is taken into account.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  There is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long term illness.  However, this misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  Misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.

It is however essential that the medicines in question are safe and that appropriate prescribing guidelines are followed by the health professional treating the child.<\/p>  <p>  Before a medicine is made available to the public, it undergoes an authorisation process whereby the medicine&rsquo;s safety, quality and efficacy is assessed, based on the results of clinical trials.  All medicines have side effects so it is only when the risk benefit analysis is positive, i.e. that the potential benefits to the patient outweigh the potential risks that the medicine receives an authorisation.    <\/p>  <p>  Once available a medicine is then subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation through a process of pharmacocovigilance which operates at EU wide level to monitor the use of medicines in large numbers of patients and manage and analyse information on suspected adverse reactions to medicines.<\/p>  <p>  European reviews of certain antipsychotics, antidepressants, stimulants and opioids have resulted in updates to product information in order to support better informed prescribing and use of these medicines in various patient groups including children. Important safety updates are communicated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to health professionals via their Drug Safety Newsletter.  The HPRA, in conjunction with its European counterparts continues to review the safety of authorised medicines and take appropriate regulatory action when necessary. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland there are a number of sources of prescribing guidelines. More recent guidelines include a Consensus Statement issued by the College of Psychiatry on the use of benzodiazepines in specialist mental health services (2012), Guidance issued by the Irish College of General Practitioners on Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Diagnosis and Management (2013), and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners 2016.  Section 42 of the Medical Council Guide states for example that doctors should keep up to date with developments in medication safety and seek independent, evidence-based sources of information on the benefits and risk of the medicine.  It also states that doctors should be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential and should take reasonable steps to make sure they are not inappropriately obtaining drugs from multiple sources. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has also been actively involved in ensuring appropriate prescribing of psychotropic drugs.  Reports are sent to GPs on a regular basis setting out the number of benzodiazepine and &lsquo;z&rsquo; drug prescriptions dispensed to their patients and these reports allow GPs to compare their prescribing patterns to that of their peers.  The reports also highlight where patients are on these medications for longer than the recommended period.  <\/p>  <p>In terms of research data, the Drug Use in Ireland and Northern Ireland Drugs Prevalence Survey 2014\/2015, commissioned by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol (NACDA) in Ireland and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland contains data on prevalence rates for sedatives\/tranquillisers and anti-depressants.  For young adults aged 15 to 34 and over lifetime prevalence (ever used) for sedatives\/tranquillisers was 8.9% (down from 10.1%, the prevalence rate reported in the last survey in 2010\/2011).  The lifetime prevalence of anti-depressant use for the same age group was 8.3% (an increase from 6.8%, the prevalence rate reported in 2010\/2011). <\/p>  <p>  The Prevalence Study do not provide information on the number of children prescribed sedatives\/tranquillisers and anti-depressants.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has some limited data on prescribing tends for children on the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme pharmacy claims database.  A 2015 research study on benzodiazepine prescribing in children carried out an analysis of GMS data over a 9 year period (2002 -2011).  The study found that prescription rates decreased slightly during the 9 year period and that prescription rates follow a similar pattern to those in other European countries.  However the data is limited insofar as it only relates to medicines reimbursed under the GMS schemes and does not include prescriptions paid for by patients privately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200106#WRVV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":2255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200106#WRVV00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2256,"qnumday":837,"qnumall":"[19406\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200106#WRVV00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to parliamentary question numbers 239 and 240 of 8 March 2017, and in view of the recent reply (details supplied) if he will address the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2257,"content":"<p>Activity Based Funding (ABF) is a new model for funding public hospital care which was introduced in 2016.

In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of Pandemrix vaccine, used during the H1N1 2009 pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year. On 23 September 2010, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the EMA concluded in its initial review of available data that the available evidence did not confirm a link but that more research was needed. <\/p>  <p>  By the end of March 2011 the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), now the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) had received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with pandemic vaccines.  The Department of Health and the HSE agreed that the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre would work with the IMB and Irish clinical experts in narcolepsy to examine the Irish data and report back the findings.  The Final Report of National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee was published on 19 April 2012.  It found a 13-fold higher risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals and the absolute increased risk associated with the vaccine was five narcolepsy cases per 100,000 vaccinated children and adolescents.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccination programme in Ireland was based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.  A number of \"at risk\" groups were defined and prioritised for vaccination commencing in October 2009.  Over 1.1 million pandemic vaccinations were recorded, giving a 25% uptake for the total population.  The vaccine uptakes among the priority groups were 50% for those medically at risk, 32% for pregnant women (it was 45% during early part of programme), 31% for health care workers, 60% for children aged 6 months to 4 years, 39%  for children aged 5-14 years and 25% for those aged 65 years and older.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010. However, following a full assessment of the situation at that time the vaccine continued to be made available free of charge to the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups through General Practice and Maternity Units until September 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Since the 2010\/2011 influenza season H1N1 has been incorporated in the seasonal flu vaccine used in Ireland. Pandemrix was distributed to GPs in January 2011 with a recommendation that it be used for those in at risk groups for a three week period when there was a temporary shortage of seasonal influenza vaccine.  All sites were asked to return any unused vaccine and it has not been recommended for use since then. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2340,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 872 and 873 answered with Question No. 868.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2341,"content":"<p>Question No. 874 answered with Question No. 821.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":2343,"qnumday":875,"qnumall":"[19472\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the ongoing concern regarding access to new pump start ups for children in County Donegal with type 1 diabetes, in view of the departure of a person (details supplied); his views on requests for a new paediatrician specialising in diabetes to be based at Letterkenny Hospital in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The HPRA highlights the fact that all medicines have some risks and a small number of people may develop side effects (also known as adverse reactions).  The clinician treating the patient balances the risks associated with a medicine in the context of the overall benefit of the medicine to the health of the patient and the condition being treated. <\/p>  <p>  Virtually all chemotherapeutic agents have the potential to initiate infusion or allergic reactions.  Premedication can help to prevent and\/or reduce the severity of infusion reactions, particularly infusion reactions.  Generally, testing patients for allergy prior to receiving a chemotherapy is of limited value because the positive and negative predictive values are not known.  Therefore, not all patients with positive results to these tests will develop reactions.  Patients must be monitored closely both during and immediately after all chemotherapy infusions.  Additional risk minimisation measures have been introduced to diminish the incidence and severity of infusion reactions (for example, prolonging the drug infusion, premedication, and antihistamines and glucocorticoids), and these measures have reduced the rate of severe reactions.<\/p>  <p>  The packaging of all medicines placed on the market must include a Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) leaflet, which sets out detailed product information intended for healthcare professionals.  This information is regularly updated as new data becomes available through various sources of post-marketing experience, including further studies, literature reviews, and evaluation of adverse reaction data.  Section 4.2 of the Taxol SmPC provides detailed information on the premedication schedules and method and durations of administration which should be followed.

Applications are assessed under Directive 2005\/36\/EC which applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than the one in which the qualification was obtained.  <\/p><p>In the case of the health and social care professions falling under the remit of CORU, the Directive provides for an assessment on a case-by-case basis of the qualifications\/professional training\/post-qualification professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host Member State (i.e. Ireland).  Due to the case-by-case nature of the assessment and the need to examine an applicant&rsquo;s individual professional experience, it is a time-consuming and administratively burdensome process.<\/p><p>Regulation 89 of S.I.

As each Registration Board at CORU has been designated competent authority for its profession under S.I. No. 8 of 2017, it is a matter for CORU to set its own fee for qualification recognition having regard to Regulation 89.  I am advised by CORU that the fee, which is in line with that charged by other competent authorities, has been set at &euro;410 since the opening of its first register - the register for Social Workers - on 31 May 2011.<\/p><p>The detailed assessment process provided for under the Directive necessitates the submission of documents verifying the applicant&rsquo;s identity, formal training, qualifications awarded, eligibility to practise and post-qualification professional experience.  As these are important documents, CORU does not accept originals; it asks applicants to provide photocopies which have been certified by a solicitor\/lawyer to be true copies of the originals.  The submission of certified copies of documents is provided for in the Directive.  While it is appreciated that this imposes additional costs on applicants, CORU must be confident that decisions on applications are based on appropriately certified documentation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX03550"},{"type":"question","counter":2378,"qnumday":886,"qnumall":"[19516\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review the issues regarding services as raised in correspondence (details supplied); his plans to enhance these particular services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2379,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to  the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":2380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX03750"},{"type":"question","counter":2381,"qnumday":887,"qnumall":"[19517\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200108#WRXX03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an urgent appointment can be arranged for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2382,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

In 2013, the Government approved and published a strategy for developing eHealth capability in the Irish health system called the <i>eHealth strategy for Ireland, 2013. <\/i>This strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth for the benefit of patients.  One of the recommendations in the strategy was the development of a system of unique identifiers for patients to underpin patient safety and efficiency.<\/p><p>The Health Identifiers Act 2014 gives the legal basis for the development and the deployment of health identifiers that will cover individual patients, and health care providers and professionals in the health service.  The development and implementation of a system of unique patient identification for our health service is a major task and was recommended by the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in 2008.  Each patient will be assigned a unique identifier when they engage with the health system for the purposes of better patient care and safety both of which are of paramount importance.  A privacy impact assessment (PIA) has been conducted and a public consultation exercise undertaken as part of the preparation for the implementation.  There has also been engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to the deployment.  It should be noted that the Individual Health Identifier is only a number and is, of itself, not a medical record.  Therefore the opt out from the number itself is not feasible and should not be confused with a patients right regarding the use of their medical information. \u00a0In that regard, it is important to bear in mind that the Health Identifiers Act 2014 did not change in any way the law, including data protection law, in relation to the statutory rights of patients regarding their medical records or the obligations that data controllers have for patients' personal health data.\u00a0 Furthermore, patients are entitled to discuss with their health care provider what happens with their health data. \u00a0It is important to point out that the roll out of a system of health identifiers for patients, has no linkage with any eligibility for any type of health service or benefit.  It is primarily a patient safety initiative and a fundamental building block for eHealth and ICT developments into the future. <\/p><p>The delivery of digital health care services and the roll out of an electronic health record (EHR) will need to be underpinned by a robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data consistent with the new EU general data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016\/679.  The new EU regulations (General Data Protection Regulation) will, from May 2018, regulate the collecting, use, keeping and disclosing of personal data, including the\u00a0purposes for which it is collected and used. \u00a0The GDPR provides a timely opportunity to examine how public confidence in the way the health system handles personal health data can be enhanced and that will involve consideration of a range of matters, including consent and the related idea of opt-out.<\/p><p>Accordingly, my Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support patient safety and allow for digital deployment of information systems into the future.  The health care delivery system requires a robust information governance environment to ensure the right information about the right patient is available securely, in the right place and at the right time. \u00a0The confidentiality of health data and the right of citizens to privacy must always be respected while at the same time be balanced against the health needs of the individual and the use of health data for the greater good of society. \u00a0These are complex and demanding issues which must be addressed in the context of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, national and health sector implementation of the new General Data Protection Regulation and existing health legislation including the Health Identifiers Act 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200111#WRAAAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":2519,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200111#WRAAAA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2520,"qnumday":933,"qnumall":"[19688\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200111#WRAAAA01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost to restore the former gross income limits for the over 70s medical card (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2521,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200111#WRAAAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200111#WRAAAA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2523,"qnumday":934,"qnumall":"[19690\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200111#WRAAAA01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the record number of persons left on trolleys in view of the fact that the &euro;40 million winter initiative was not effective in addressing the issue; if one of the central focuses of his plan will be acquiring additional nursing staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2524,"content":"<p>Since the start of 2017 there have been approximately 5% less patients waiting on trolleys nationally compared to the same period last year. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware,  in September the HSE launched  its &lsquo;Winter Initiative Plan 2016-2017&rsquo; which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness.  This Initiative was developed to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care. <\/p>  <p>  A significant focus of the Winter Initiative was on reducing delayed discharges in acute hospitals through the funding and provision of additional homecare packages, home help hours and transitional care beds.  Delayed discharges reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December and were maintained below 500 from mid-December through to end February.  This had a positive impact on ED overcrowding and trolley numbers, in freeing up beds for use by patients awaiting admission to hospital. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE  fully recognise the importance of recruiting and retaining nurses within the public health system to deliver services.

The terms of the agreement, which has now been published,<\/font>provides for the establishment of a new company - <i>&quot;The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares)&rdquo;.  <\/i><\/p><p>The new company will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">This independence will be assured by the reserved powers which are set out in the agreement and will be copperfastened by the golden share which will be held by the Minister for Health of the day.  These reserved powers can only be amended with the unanimous written approval of the Directors and with the approval of the Minister for Health.  The Board of the new NMH will comprise nine directors; four nominated by SVHG, four by NMH, including the Master, and one will be an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Two of the NMH Directors will also sit on the SVHG Board. <\/font><\/p><p>The agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the NMH at Elm Park without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, I welcome the confirmation by the Board of SVHG that any medical procedure, which is in accordance with the laws of this State, will be carried out at the new hospital.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I should also acknowledge that the SVHG is making valuable land available, at no cost to the State, to facilitate the new NMH.  In doing so, they have foregone the opportunity to put this land to alternative use. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">As set out in the agreement, the establishment of the new company will necessitate an amendment of the NMH Charter; however as we are still in the very early stages, my Department has not yet been in communication with the NMH in relation to this issue.<\/font><\/p><p>Now that the planning application for the development has been submitted we must now turn our focus to the legal mechanisms necessary to operationalise the agreement.  The hospital will be publicly funded, built on lands in the ownership of the SVHG and operated by the new company.  Over the next few weeks I will meet with both hospitals and will consider further the legal mechanisms necessary to absolutely protect the State's considerable investment in the hospital, including the issue of ownership of the new facility.  Prior to the HSE entering into any construction contract, I will formally sanction the necessary arrangements to ensure that the facilities are legally secured on an on-going basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services commitments.  I should add that over the years we have made very significant capital investment in voluntary hospitals, and no issues have ever arisen in relation to same.  I therefore do not foresee any difficulty in this regard. <\/p><p>I intend to report to Government on this project at the end of May. At that stage I expect to have further details on the legal and other arrangements envisaged and will make this information available publicly.  This will allow for the necessary clarity well in advance of contractual or other commitments being entered into in respect of this project.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like reaffirm my commitment to this hugely important project. The facilities at Holles St are no longer fit for purpose.  It is also acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders to deliver the new National Maternity Hospital which is so badly needed to provide women and infants with modern healthcare facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200111#WRAAAA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HIQA Investigations","counter":2552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200112#WRBBBBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2553,"qnumday":944,"qnumall":"[19775\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200112#WRBBBBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an investigation into the death of a person (details supplied); if correspondence sent to HIQA by a person (details supplied) will be investigated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2554,"content":"<p>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the statutory independent regulator for the nursing home sector and this responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.<\/p><p>Nursing homes are monitored and inspected to ensure that they meet the requirements set out by the Health Act 2007, and by the regulations and national standards.

The Review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary Community First Responder (CFR) schemes.  The further developments of a comprehensive national programme of CFR schemes has therefore been prioritised in the HSE National Service Plan 2017.  The NAS continues to work with local CFR Groups across the country, and in Connemara, in an effort to enhance services and greatly values their continued commitment and support.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government and the NAS are fully committed to the provision of a safe, patient focused pre-hospital emergency care service.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles.  In this regard, &euro;7.2m additional funding was provided to the NAS in 2016, and in 2017, an additional &euro;3.6m has been provided, including &euro;1m to fund new developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200115#WREEEEE06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":2758,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200115#WREEEEE06200"},{"type":"question","counter":2759,"qnumday":1016,"qnumall":"[20098\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200115#WREEEEE06300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for mandatory safety measures to be installed on transportation services for disabled persons accessing day care centres or other regular services (details supplied) in order to protect these vulnerable persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2760,"content":"<p>The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.

The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccination and the scientific evidence is clear that benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects<\/p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored and any new evidence concerning side-effects is taken into account.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  There is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long term illness.  However, this misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  Misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.  Vaccination is the best way for parents to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue referred to by the Deputy it concerns a complaint made by the Nordic Cochrane Centre concerning the EMA.  The EMA is a decentralised agency of the European Union (EU) responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any complaint made by a third party concerning an EU agency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":2893,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02450"},{"type":"question","counter":2894,"qnumday":1061,"qnumall":"[20390\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding making the immunotherapy drug nivolumab available to cancer patients on the reimbursement scheme; the costs associated with treating each person on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2895,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2896,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02650"},{"type":"question","counter":2897,"qnumday":1062,"qnumall":"[20391\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department will establish a forum for persons with myalgic encephalomyelitis and their organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2898,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2900,"qnumday":1063,"qnumall":"[20422\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200118#WRHHH02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2901,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Persons with disabilities, including deaf-blindness, can access a broad range of acute, primary and community based health services, as well as specialist disability services, which are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory and non-statutory groups.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for The Anne Sullivan Foundation for Deaf-Blind is provided by the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act, 2004. The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Division Operational Plan indicates that &euro;2.56 million has been assigned to the Foundation in 2017 for the provision of supports to people who are deaf-blind.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health does not classify specific medical illnesses or conditions as a disability. There are a number of definitions of disability that are used for particular purposes e.g. the Disability Act, Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, Equal Status Act, Employment Equality Acts and qualifying criteria for income supports such as Domiciliary Care Allowance and Disability Allowance etc. These definitions describe disability in terms of an individual's functional ability in their environment, rather than a medical diagnosis or a named condition.<\/p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy, which is led by the Department of Justice, sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who are able to, and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has the lead responsibility for the Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Deaf-blindness is not currently listed as a separate condition on the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database (NPSDD). However, syndromes related to a combination of deafness and blindness could be included in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2015 the HSE published new guidelines giving practical guidelines to all health and social care staff on how they can provide accessible services to patients and clients with a disability. The guidelines were developed by the HSE in partnership with the National Disability Authority.

In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).

2025&rdquo;.<\/i>The key themes of the Policy are Prevention, Care and Management, and Research and Data with the overall aim of reversing the rising levels of overweight and obesity.  The World Health Organisation has set a global target to halt the rise in obesity by 2025. <i>&ldquo;A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rdquo;<\/i>will cover the ten year period until 2025 and sets targets to be achieved and actions that will produce measurable outcomes.  Twenty priority actions have been identified and work has commenced on the implementation of the majority of those priority actions already.  The timeframes for the other actions will operate over the lifespan of the policy which is 2016 - 2025.<\/p><p>Some specifics regarding actions which the Deputy has requested information on are as follows:<\/p><p>Action 1.4 - The Department of Health, in collaboration with the HSE is working with the Department of Education and Skills on the development of a 'whole of school' healthy lifestyle programme.  This approach includes schools curriculum, policies, environment and working with parents and the community.  Potable water provision is an integral part in policies pertaining to nutrition, physical activity and wellbeing of children.  My Department does not have a direct function in relation to rolling out initiatives in school settings as this is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.  However both Departments are in discussion on how best to progress measures relating to healthy lifestyles in the school setting.<\/p><p>Action 1.8 - My Department has published a paper regarding a levy on Sugar Sweetened Drinks - <i>&quot;Introducing a Tax on Sugar Sweetened Drinks - Health Rationale, Options and Recommendations,&quot; <\/i>which is available on the Department's website and which will support the Department of Finances' budget proposals to introduce a Sugar Sweetened Drinks levy in 2018 and which is contained in the Programme for Government. <\/p><p>Action 1.10 - An amount of work has been undertaken and is ongoing in relation to the evidence review of fiscal measures on products that are high in fat, sugar and salt.  The Institute of Public Health is currently reviewing patterns of sugar sweetened drinks consumption as a contribution to this work.  This Department will continue research in this area including on factors that may influence behaviour change relating to diet.<\/p><p>Action 2.1 - Drafting has already commenced on potential terms of reference for the establishment of a working group to develop a set of guidelines in relation to the built environment.  The group will comprise relevant Government Departments, The Health Services Executive, County and City Councils, Academics and Professional Bodies among others.<\/p><p>The National Physical Activity Plan also contains a number of actions in relation to the built environment, including the development of guidelines and a programme of continuous professional development for those working in the built environment to promote the importance of physical activity.  However, the undertaking of an audit of schools and learning centres would be a matter for the Department of Education and Skills as my Department does not have responsibility for school infrastructure and development. <\/p><p>Action 10.2 - Certain preparatory work has been undertaken with regard to the requirements in relation to nutritional health surveillance.  Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data for use in planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice.  The annual Healthy Ireland Survey is among the activities undertaken by the Department to enhance the range of reliable information available to it.  The Survey was commissioned to enhance data collection and monitoring capacity in the implementation of Healthy Ireland.  The survey results include information on diet and nutrition including data on eating habits, the consumption of fruit and vegetables, the consumption of snacks and sugar sweetened drinks, and the use of folic acid supplements.  This is being utilised to advance our knowledge and understanding of the Obesity problem.<\/p><p>Two waves of the Survey have been published, and are available at:  .  A third report will be published later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200122#WRMMM03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1339"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Physical Education","counter":3058,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200122#WRMMM03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3059,"qnumday":1135,"qnumall":"[20835\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200122#WRMMM03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to roll out national initiatives to increase physical activity for children in schools as part of the national physical activity plan; if he will work with the Minister for Education and Skills to examine the need for physical activity and education to be part of the education syllabus from early childhood education to secondary level and to be part of teacher training; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This competitive grant aid Scheme is fully funded by the Irish Exchequer and provides up to 40% grant aid (50% for approved applicants under 35 years of age) towards the cost of approved capital investments in specialised horticultural equipment and buildings.  These include investments in bee breeding and honey production equipment as well as facilities e.g. honey houses, honey extractors and bottling equipment. Grant aid is not paid for bee colonies.  The minimum proposed investment for beekeepers is &euro;2,000 excluding VAT. <\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department also pays annual grants to Irish National Beekeepers associations to help their associated members and branches to pursue the craft of beekeeping to the highest standards and to also inform the general public about the environmental role that bees play in maintaining Irish bio-diversity and crop production. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising the importance of maintaining a healthy honey bee population the Department has put a number of measures in place over time.

After having carefully considered the matter, I decided that, without prejudice, there is a case for a review of the policy on allocations between the RSW Pelagic segment and the polyvalent segment of the fleet, taking account of request by the IS&amp;WFO.  In that regard, I decided that I am restricting consideration to the increased quota for Ireland in 2017 over that in 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that I have not made any decision at this time to change the allocations between the segments in respect of this part of the quota.

Revised policy in relation to the management of herring stocks was announced in June 2012 following intensive consultation with industry and other key stakeholders<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be particularly interested in the NWH fishery. In this regard, the access arrangements for vessels to the main fishery was established in 2012 based on track record in 2010 and earlier years.  This is an autumn fishery and vessels eligible for this fishery are allocated an annual allocation. Up to 5% of the quota is also made available for vessels under 20m without a track record on the basis of modest monthly catch limits.  However, this policy for North West herring was set aside on an exceptional basis in 2016 following consultation with stakeholders to facilitate a wide scale scientific stock assessment, the main focus of which was to sample the stock. With this in mind, the overall adjusted quota for Ireland in 2016 was 2,703 tonnes and for 2017 is 2,112 tonnes.  Arrangements for the 2017 North West herring fishery to support continued data collection will be considered in consultation with stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  Quotas are made available to the owners of licensed sea fishing boats by me in line with the provisions of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 as amended.

The Forest Park to which the Deputy refers, namely Killykeen Forest Park, Co. Cavan, is part of the Coillte forest estate. Coillte CGA was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act, 1988 and day-to-day operational matters, such as the management of their properties and related transactions, are the responsibility of the company.<\/p>  <p>  The company has, however, provided me with relevant information in relation to this matter.  I note, in the first instance, that, while the company is proposing to dispose of the Killykeen Holiday Village Complex, Killykeen Forest Park will not be affected by the proposed disposal.  It is also noted that while it forms part of the forest park, the Holiday Village Complex is separate to Killykeen Forest Park. As indicated, actual transactions are operational matters for Coillte.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the Killykeen Holiday Village Complex has in effect been on the market since 2009, with a renewed marketing campaign launched in May 2016.  I am also advised, in relation to the stage of the proposed disposal, that the transaction is at an advanced stage of negotiation, and that Coillte are optimistic that a completion is imminent.  With reference to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about safeguards, Coillte advise that, in evaluating the submissions from interested parties, the company is taking into consideration their respective business development proposals for the Holiday Complex.<\/p>  <p>  As regards consultation with the local community, I understand that this Complex, which contains circa 30 hectares, has not been open to the general public since 2009 and, as such, the local community will not be adversely affected by the proposed disposal. Coillte also advise that the Forest Park is and will remain open to the general public.<\/p>  <p>  Coillte add that it has considered the social value of the business, and are optimistic that a new owner will invest and redevelop the Holiday Village Complex, thereby creating a valuable tourism resource in this area. I am advised that fishing rights will not be impacted and access to Killykeen Forest Park will not be restricted by the proposed disposal of Killlykeen Holiday Village Complex. <\/p>  <p>  I understand, from Coillte, that no direct consultation on the sale of the Holiday Village Complex was held with Cavan County Council.  Coillte add that, as part of Coillte&rsquo;s consultation process for property sales, the company consults with all stakeholders directly affected by the proposed sale and, due to the nature of use of the Holiday Village Complex, Cavan County Council was not one of these stakeholders. Coillte advise, that, as part of other discussions with Cavan County Council, the proposed sale of the Village Complex has been noted and the Council is aware of the proposed sales process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200125#WRPPP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Promotion","counter":3190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200125#WRPPP01550"},{"type":"question","counter":3191,"qnumday":1180,"qnumall":"[19704\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200125#WRPPP01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider introducing a project to support activities (details supplied) in counties Cavan and Monaghan in order to boost tourism and create local employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3192,"content":"<p>Functions relating to tourism and its development are not assigned to me or my Department.

Cattle destined for live export are monitored by Department Veterinary Inspectors at the time of loading and during the prescribed isolation period in Ireland where an isolation period is required by the importing country. This is in addition to any inspections that may be carried out by Official Veterinarians from the country of destination of the animals. Private Veterinary Practitioners (PVP) also undertake the testing and certification required prior to export. Only animals certified fit to travel are loaded onto trucks under the supervision of Department Veterinary Inspectors. At Port of departure, the animals are unloaded from the trucks and walk onto the dedicated livestock ship and this process is also supervised by my Department officials.  Cattle who are penned on board a livestock ship will typically be in very similar conditions to any feedlot situation. <\/p>  <p>  Irish legislative standards for sea transport are recognised by the EU Commission as being amongst the most effective and stringent legislation in force as regards transport by sea.

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.  My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;25million includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The participating banks will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis.\u00a0 Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, I will shortly make preliminary information on the Scheme available.

I am currently meeting with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating access to finance in the agri-food sector.

The\u00a0report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is\u00a0available at the following link: .  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This group will drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on\u00a0progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report shortly. <\/p><p>In addition, I have\u00a0signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.

The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200129#WRTTT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3415,"content":"<p>Question No. 1260 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Licence Fee","counter":3416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200129#WRTTT03700"},{"type":"question","counter":3417,"qnumday":1261,"qnumall":"[19452\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200129#WRTTT03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the aim of the new proposal to implement a television licence fee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3418,"content":"<p>I recognise the important role that public service broadcasters play\u00a0in our democratic society and the provision of\u00a0stable and adequate funding is essential to ensuring they can continue to deliver on that role.

Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with\u00a0Minister Humphreys to\u00a0identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate\u00a0how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  The\u00a0report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.\u00a0<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This Group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This Group will be formally reporting every 90 days on\u00a0progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>The benefits that the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report will bring will be felt across Ireland.<\/p><p>In addition to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force, other initiatives are underway to enhance services across the State.  I have\u00a0signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band. This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.

The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  In terms of commercial investment, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and\u00a0the capacity of the network, as well as by\u00a0and proximity to mobile telephone antennas. <\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200130#WRUUU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":3437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200130#WRUUU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":3438,"qnumday":1269,"qnumall":"[19645\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200130#WRUUU01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to provide broadband to persons residing at addresses (details supplied).","asker":"1284","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":3439,"qnumday":1270,"qnumall":"[19646\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200130#WRUUU01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to provide broadband to persons residing in an area (details supplied).","asker":"1284","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":3440,"qnumday":1271,"qnumall":"[19647\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200130#WRUUU01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to provide broadband to persons residing at an address (details supplied).","asker":"1284","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3441,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1269 to 1271, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland. The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>On the 4 April, I\u00a0signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its\u00a0plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.\u00a0 <\/p><p>On the same day I\u00a0published\u00a0 an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. which\u00a0finalises the\u00a0State Intervention area.  The\u00a0updated Map shows\u00a0the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The map shows that the eircodes referred to by the Deputy\u00a0\u00a0within the townlands of Ballygroman Lower and <font color=\"#444444\">Barrahaurin are in the AMBER area and will require State Intervention.\u00a0In addition the Map\u00a0shows that<\/font>79% of the townland of Ballynora and 100% of the townland of Curraheen (Ed Inishkenny)\u00a0Co Cork\u00a0fall within the AMBER area and will also be part of the State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining 21% of the townland of Ballynora falls within the BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators and includes 2% of premises where eir is planning to deliver high speed broadband by 2018. \u00a0Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.The \u00a0three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0<\/p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand and\u00a0a prioritisation programme.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p><p>In this regard,\u00a0I established\u00a0a Mobile Phone and Broadband\u00a0Task Force in July 2016\u00a0together with\u00a0Minister Humphreys to\u00a0identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate\u00a0how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.

Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland. The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p>  <p>  On\u00a04 April, I\u00a0signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its\u00a0plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over a\u00a090 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website www.dccae.gov.ie.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On the same day I\u00a0published\u00a0 an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. which\u00a0finalises the\u00a0State Intervention area.  The\u00a0updated Map shows\u00a0the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:<\/p>  <p>   - The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p>  <p>   - The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are circa 89,000 premises in County Kildare, approximately 13,000 (14%) of which are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining c76,000 (75%) premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators and includes approx. 9,000 (12%)\u00a0 where eir is planning to deliver high speed broadband by 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie <\/p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0The level of subsidy that will be sought by bidders to roll-out high speed broadband in Amber areas of the High Speed broadband Map, will be established through that procurement process. No\u00a0subsidy is paid towards the investment by commercial operators in rolling out high speed broadband in the Blue areas of the map. <\/p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand and\u00a0a prioritisation programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":3480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV00700"},{"type":"question","counter":3481,"qnumday":1287,"qnumall":"[20252\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to secure the future of post offices with particular reference to post offices in Fingal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3482,"content":"<p>It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have responsibility for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post, to ensure the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of a reconfiguration of Government Departments in July last year, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.\u00a0Arrangements are in hand to reassign this responsibility to my Department given my overall responsibility for An Post.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the post office network is an operational matter for the Board and management of An Post and not one in which I, as Minister, have a statutory function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3483,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 1288 and 1289, answered with Question No. 1286<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Media Mergers","counter":3484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":3485,"qnumday":1290,"qnumall":"[20261\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has provided an update on the proposed media merger involving the acquisition of sole control of a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3486,"content":"<p>Following approval by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, notification of the proposed merger referenced in the question was received by me as Minister on 21 November 2016.

Residential home heating is a key source of air pollution, in particular from solid fuel and smoky coal, and as such there is a pre-existing commitment to extend the smoky coal ban nationwide by 2018.\u00a0 I\u00a0expect that the strategy will be published by the end of 2017 and\u00a0that I\u00a0will to be to be in a position to implement the national ban in time for the heating season of 2018, that is the third quarter of that year.<font color=\"#1F497D\">\u00a0<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":3501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV02800"},{"type":"question","counter":3502,"qnumday":1296,"qnumall":"[20537\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the status of plans to extend broadband cover to a location (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3503,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland. The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>On\u00a04 April, I\u00a0signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its\u00a0plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over a\u00a090 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie<\/i>.\u00a0 <\/p><p>On the same day I\u00a0published\u00a0 an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. which\u00a0finalises the\u00a0State Intervention area.The\u00a0updated Map shows\u00a0the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The map shows that 98% of the townland of Fountainstown, \u00a0Cork falls within the AMBER area and will require State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining 2% of the townland \u00a0fall \u00a0within the BLUE area and will\u00a0 covered by commercial operators.Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The \u00a0three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p><p>In this regard,\u00a0I established the Task Force in July 2016\u00a0together with\u00a0Minister Humphreys to\u00a0identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate\u00a0how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The\u00a0report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is\u00a0 available at the following link: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. <\/p><p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March. This group will drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions. This group will formally report every 90 days on\u00a0progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys. I am expecting the first such quarterly report shortly. <\/p><p>In addition, I have\u00a0signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band. This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.\u00a0<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mining Licences","counter":3504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV03100"},{"type":"question","counter":3505,"qnumday":1297,"qnumall":"[20579\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200131#WRVVV03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding a new application to mine coal (details supplied); when this matter will be dealt with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3506,"content":"<p>Prospecting Licence 3891 is held by Dan Morrissey (Ireland) Ltd.\u00a0 A Prospecting Licence confers a right to prospect for minerals\u00a0but not to mine minerals.\u00a0 My Department is in receipt of an application for a\u00a0State Mining Lease in respect of the mining of coal and fireclay at\u00a0Rossmore, Co.

I do expect that the status of the Cork to Limerick road link will be examined as part of the Review of the Capital Plan which is under way.  In relation to the Narrow Water Bridge project, while the Capital Plan outlines the Government\u00a0commitment to the concept of the Bridge, it does not provide specific funding for the project.

The Department has recently approved IDA's request to reinstate its Graduate Recruitment Programme on a three year contract basis and will commence the recruitment process shortly.\u00a0 In addition, IDA has received official sanction to recruit 10 additional &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; staff members.

The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted schemes, will be introduced at a later date, when it is fully ready for operation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the potential impact of the rules proposed for the Affordable Childcare Scheme, in particular the rule limiting childcare subsidies to 15 hours per week for families where a parent is not engaged in any form of work or training.  This rule reflects a balance between the scheme&rsquo;s objectives of supporting child development and supporting labour market participation for families with low incomes, and thereby contributing to the reduction of child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  In determining the rules for the scheme, I want to ensure a balanced approach to eligibility: while people will qualify for a subsidy based purely on income, parents&rsquo; participation in work or training will determine the number of hours of subsidy available.  When parents are engaged in work (including even small amounts of part-time work or participation in labour market activation programmes) or in education or training, they will be eligible for an enhanced hours subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will nevertheless be subsidised on a standard hours basis of up to 15 hours per week, reflecting the benefits for all children of part-time participation in childcare.  I believe that this is a reasonable approach.<\/p>  <p>  It will mean that the Affordable Childcare Scheme will be open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who stay at home to care for their children, and are not taking part in any work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week.  In the case of school-going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours childcare will apply only to non-term time.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that I intend to take a very inclusive approach in defining &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;study&rdquo; for the purpose of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  As a consequence, many social welfare recipients will benefit from the enhanced hours subsidy (i.e. up to 40 hours per week), as many social welfare payments allow a parent to work part-time, for a certain number of hours or days per week.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that where a parent is at home and not engaged in any work or study, the family will not benefit from subsidised after-school childcare during term-times, because of the 15-hour limit.  However, I believe it is right that the Scheme should actively support labour market participation through linking the number of hours of subsidy to a family&rsquo;s need for childcare for the purpose of work, education or training.  Supporting labour market participation for low-income families is an essential part of our efforts to reduce child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a small but important group of families for whom childcare is needed on child welfare grounds or for whom childcare is a necessary early intervention support, and where there is a referral by Tusla.  For the Affordable Childcare Scheme, it is proposed that, where such a referral is made, families would automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income or work\/study test.  Tusla would recommend the hours of childcare needed.  The scheme would then provide the maximum rate of subsidy in respect of those hours of care, and no payment would be asked of the parents in these circumstances.  This approach is consistent with current practice under CCS and is critical to supporting strong child welfare and protection practices.  My officials are currently in discussion with Tusla in relation to the way in which this referral process will operate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":3855,"qnumday":1430,"qnumall":"[19366\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to provide funding for the construction or assistance of new community creches for the Clonskeagh area, in view of the changing demographics and the current pressure on childcare services in the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3856,"content":"<p>In response to the expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme announced in Budget 2016, and to support the development of capacity in the sector, my Department initiated a number of actions: my Department made detailed information available to the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) at the beginning of 2016 indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017.

I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to ensure the allocation of a social worker to all children and young people who need one.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health and the need to find an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of February 2017 (the latest data available), there was a total of 25,387 open child welfare and protection cases nationwide.  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  Of the 25,387 open cases, 77% (19,667) had an allocated social worker and 5,720 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  Of the children awaiting allocation to a social worker at the end of February, 1,057 were high priority.<\/p>  <p>  Cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker.<\/p>  <p>  It is a continuing priority of Tusla to address the problem of unallocated cases in 2017.  Tusla currently has 1,480 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.  I attach a high priority to tackling this matter and I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and senior management team, over the course of the year, to review progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":3866,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC03350"},{"type":"question","counter":3867,"qnumday":1434,"qnumall":"[19689\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC03400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason her Department cannot access income information from the Revenue Commissioners; the estimated number of families which will miss out on the child care subsidy as a consequence; when this will be ameliorated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3868,"content":"<p>It is incorrect to suggest that my Department cannot access income information from the Revenue Commissioners, or from the Department of Social Protection.  Throughout the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme, both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection have worked closely with my Department to ensure the new Scheme will have full and efficient access to income information.  Officials of my Department have at all times received a high level of cooperation and support from both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is an extremely complex and ambitious project because of all that is involved - legislation, new business processes, data protection and building a new IT system.  Since the policy paper for the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme was approved by Government in October 2016, officials of the DCYA and Pobal have been working intensively to plan for the implementation of this Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced that a number of changes will be made to existing childcare schemes that will bring substantial benefits to an estimated 70,000 children and their families from this September.  These changes will include a new universal childcare subsidy for children aged from 6 months up to 36 months old (or commencement of the free pre-school programme).  It is estimated that this new universal childcare subsidy may benefit approximately 33,000 children and their families.  For children in full-time, registered childcare, the subsidy will amount to approximately &euro;1,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there will be significant increases of up to 50 percent in childcare subvention rates provided under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years old.  It is estimated that up to 37,000 children and their families may benefit from targeted subsidies from this September.  A large proportion of these will see an increase in their weekly subsidy.  For example, parents availing of full-time childcare who currently have their childcare costs subsidised by &euro;95 per week under the Community Childcare Subvention will see their subvention rate rise to &euro;145 per week.  Thousands of children and their families are expected to benefit from targeted supports for the first time from September due to improved access to existing schemes through a greater number of childcare providers throughout the country.  These children and their families too will benefit from these generous increases in childcare subvention rates.<\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will be introduced at the earliest possible date, while ensuring that the scheme is fully operational and user-friendly for all concerned.  When it is introduced, additional families who are not eligible for current schemes but who then meet ACS income criteria will also benefit from subsidies. Given the considerable uncertainty about the impact of the new scheme on parental demand for childcare, the number of additional beneficiaries at that stage cannot be determined with any precision. However, it is estimated that the total number of beneficiaries in the first year of the Affordable Childcare Scheme may be approximately 79,000 and that the number is likely to continue to rise over time in response to parental demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":3869,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3870,"qnumday":1435,"qnumall":"[19791\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050200138#WRCCC03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will address a matter (details supplied) in relation to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, eligibility of a person; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The programme was then expanded beginning in September 2016 by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  The upper age limit for the free pre-school programme is set at 5 years and 6 months, meaning that if a child is going to be older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of a pre-school year (i.e. end of June) they are not eligible to avail of free pre-school in that year.

It was awarded to persons who were awarded 1916 military service under the Military Service Pensions Acts, or to those who did not apply for a pension but who satisfied the Minister that they would have been awarded 1916 military service if they had applied under the Acts.  In relation to the case in question, the board of assessors (comprised of senior old IRA officers and chaired by a judge) appointed under Section 3(1) of the Military Service Pensions Act 1924 (the 1924 Act), examined the application of the person in question for the purpose of making a report to the Minister for Defence as to the military service of the applicant.  The board reported its findings to the Minister for Defence and on foot of that report the Minister decided on 4 January 1927 that a certificate of military service could be granted in respect the period 1 April 1920 to 30 September 1923 (including service in the National Army) but not in respect of the 1916 period.  An appeal was made to the then Minister for Defence in 1928 to have the case re-opened but this appeal was unsuccessful.<\/p>  <p>  In 1942 the person in question applied for a 1916 Medal but it was found that while he had a certificate of military service under the 1924 Act it did not cover the relevant period in 1916.  The person in question was, however, awarded the Service Medal (1917-1921) with bar, in respect of his service.<\/p>  <p>  The power given to the board of assessors in Section 3(6) of the 1924 Act to re-open any or all of their findings (as amended by Section 2 of the Military Service Pensions Act 1930) was removed by the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act 1949.  Under the 1949 Act applications under the 1924 Act could only be re-examined where the Minister had refused to issue a certificate of military service to an applicant; however, the applicant in question was issued with such a certificate in 1927.<\/p>  <p>  The matter has been examined and investigated by senior officials on a significant number of occasions on foot of representations received but in the absence of any statutory powers it is not possible, nor would I consider it appropriate, to reopen the findings of the board of assessors.  The board of assessors was required under Section 3(2) of the 1924 Act to &ldquo;examine all applications...make such enquiries, summon all such witnesses, and take all such evidence whether on oath or otherwise&rdquo;.  As the Deputy will appreciate the person in question and all members of the Old IRA and witnesses to the events of 1916 are deceased.<\/p>  <p>  The approach to assessment of military service was an extremely comprehensive one with an appeals mechanism by which individual cases could be re-opened and any additional evidence provided.  It would not be possible over one hundred years after the time in question, and many decades since these processes concluded, to improve on this work which is now a matter of history, although I recognise that it is very important history and of keen concern to the relations of those involved.

The objective of this 10-week scheme is to help develop a path to economic independence for participants, aged between 18 and 24 years, who are at a serious disadvantage owing to their current socio-economic situation.  The scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose.  The plan is to run two iterations of the programme in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The first iteration of the programme will commence in Limerick on 22 May 2017. There are 30 places on the programme and the selection process is ongoing.

Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.
